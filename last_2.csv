Here we describe a novel, versatile and simple PCR-RFLP procedure baptised ‘derived Polymorphic Amplified Cleaved Sequence’ (dPACS) for genotyping individual samples. The notable advantage of the method is that it employs a pair of primers that cover the entire fragment to be amplified except for one or few diagnostic bases around the SNP/DIP being investigated. As such, it provides greater opportunities to introduce mismatches in one or both of the 35–55 bp primers for creating a restriction site that unambiguously differentiates wild from mutant sequences following PCR-RFLP and horizontal MetaPhorTM gel electrophoresis. Selection of effective restriction enzymes and primers is aided by the newly developed dPACS 1.0 software. The highly transferable dPACS procedure is exemplified here with the positive detection (in up to 24 grass and broadleaf species tested) of wild type proline106 of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase and its serine, threonine and alanine variants that confer resistance to glyphosate, and serine264 and isoleucine2041 which are key target-site determinants for weed sensitivities to some photosystem II and acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibiting herbicides, respectively.Keywords: dPACS, PCR-RFLP, SNP, genotyping, herbicide resistance, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), photosystem II, EPSPS",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6651057/

The structural and functional genomics approaches have now pinpointed the technical challenge in the exploration of disease-related genes and the recognition of their structural alterations or elucidation of gene function. Various promising technologies and diagnostic applications of structural genomics are currently preparing a large database of disease-genes, genetic alterations etc., by mutation scanning and DNA chip technology. Further the functional genomics also exploring the expression genetics (hybridization-, PCR- and sequence-based technologies), two-hybrid technology, next generation sequencing with Bioinformatics and computational biology. Advances in microarray “chip” technology as microarrays have allowed the parallel analysis of gene expression patterns of thousands of genes simultaneously. Sequence information collected from the genomes of many individuals is leading to the rapid discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs. Further advances of genetic engineering have also revolutionized immunoassay biotechnology via engineering of antibody-encoding genes and the phage display technology. The Biotechnology plays an important role in the development of diagnostic assays in response to an outbreak or critical disease response need. However, there is also need to pinpoint various obstacles and issues related to the commercialization and widespread dispersal of genetic knowledge derived from the exploitation of the biotechnology industry and the development and marketing of diagnostic services. Implementation of genetic criteria for patient selection and individual assessment of the risks and benefits of treatment emerges as a major challenge to the pharmaceutical industry.

Given the importance of gut microbes in digestion, a genetically engineered microbe could potentially degrade some ingested phenylalanine from the diet prior to absorption. To test this, a phenylalanine lyase gene from Anabaena variabilis (AvPAL) was codon-optimized and cloned into a shuttle vector for expression in Lactobacillus reuteri 100-23C (pHENOMMenal). Functional expression of AvPAL was determined in vitro, and subsequently tested in vivo in homozygous PAHenu2 (PKU model) mice. Initial trials of two PAHenu2 homozygous (PKU) mice defined conditions for freeze-drying and delivery of bacteria. Animals showed reduced blood phe within three to four days of treatment with pHENOMMenal probiotic, and blood phe concentrations remained significantly reduced (P < 0.0005) compared to untreated controls during the course of experiments. Although pHENOMMenal probiotic could be cultured from fecal samples at four months post treatment, it could no longer be cultivated from feces at eight months post treatment, indicating eventual loss of the microbe from the gut. Preliminary screens during experimentation found no immune response to AvPAL.

Here, we describe a non-quantitative direct-infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry (DI-HRMS) based metabolomics method and evaluate the method for both dried blood spots (DBS) and plasma. 110 DBS of 42 patients harboring 23 different inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) and 86 plasma samples of 38 patients harboring 21 different IEM were analyzed using DI-HRMS. A peak calling pipeline developed in R programming language provided Z-scores for ~1875 mass peaks corresponding to ~3835 metabolite annotations (including isomers) per sample. Based on metabolite Z-scores, patients were assigned a ‘most probable diagnosis’ by an investigator blinded for the known diagnoses of the patients. Based on DBS sample analysis, 37/42 of the patients, corresponding to 22/23 IEM, could be correctly assigned a ‘most probable diagnosis’. Plasma sample analysis, resulted in a correct ‘most probable diagnosis’ in 32/38 of the patients, corresponding to 19/21 IEM. The added clinical value of the method was illustrated by a case wherein DI-HRMS metabolomics aided interpretation of a variant of unknown significance (VUS) identified by whole-exome sequencing.

Therefore, myelin water imaging can be a valuable tool to better understand the underlying white matter pathology in demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. To apply myelin water imaging in multisite studies and clinical applications, it must be acquired in a clinically feasible scan time (less than 15 min) and be reproducible across sites and scanner vendors. Here, we assessed the reproducibility of MWF measurements in regional and global white matter in 10 healthy human brains across two sites with two different 3 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner vendors (Philips and Siemens), using a 32-echo gradient and spin echo (GRASE) sequence. A strong correlation was found between the MWF measurements in the global white matter (Pearson’s r = 0.91; p < 0.001) for all participants across the two sites. The mean intersite MWF coefficient of variation across participants was 2.77% in the global white matter and ranged from 4.47% (splenium of the corpus callosum) to 17.89% (genu of the corpus callosum) in white matter regions of interest. Bland-Altman analysis showed a good agreement in MWF measurements between the two sites with small bias of 0.002. Overall, MWF estimates were in good agreement across the two sites and scanner vendors. Our findings support the use of quantitative multi-echo T2 relaxation metrics, such as the MWF, in multicenter studies and clinical trials to gain deeper understanding about the pathological processes resulting from the underlying disease progression in neurodegenerative diseases.Keywords: myelin water imaging, GRASE, reproducibility, quantitative imaging, multi-site, multi-vendor, magnetic resonance imaging",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6258882/

Accordingly, better knowledge on the pathophysiology of depression and mechanisms underlying depressive comorbidities in chronic medical conditions appears urgently needed, in order to help in the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. In this review, we present evidence pointing to inflammatory processes as key players in the pathophysiology and treatment of depressive symptoms. In particular, we report preclinical and clinical findings showing that inflammation-driven alterations in specific metabolic pathways, namely kynurenine and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathways, leads to substantial alterations in the metabolism of serotonin, glutamate and dopamine that are likely to contribute to the development of key depressive symptom dimensions. Accordingly, anti-inflammatory interventions targeting kynurenine and BH4 pathways may be effective as novel treatment or as adjuvants of conventional medications rather directed to monoamines, notably when depressive symptomatology and inflammation are comorbid in treated patients. This notion is discussed in the light of recent findings illustrating the tight interactions between known antidepressant drugs and inflammatory processes, as well as their therapeutic implications. Altogether, this review provides valuable findings for moving toward more adapted and personalized therapeutic strategies to treat inflammation-related depressive symptoms.Keywords: inflammation, neuroinflammation, kynurenines, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), monoamines, depressive symptoms, antidepressant treatment, anti-inflammatory strategies",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6095005/

This study attempted to identify potential biomarkers by detecting changes in the levels of plasma proteins in T2DM patients following onset of AMI in comparison with those without AMI. Volunteer T2DM patients without AMI (control; n=10) and T2DM patients with AMI (n=10) were recruited. Plasma samples from these patients were evaluated via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) to screen for proteins with level changes between the two groups. The abundance of spots on gel images was analyzed using Progenesis SameSpots and subjected to false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. Protein spots with statistically significant changes of at least 1.5 fold were selected for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Due to strong cardiac connections, tetranectin and titin were evaluated by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The adjusted P-values and fold changes between the two groups resulted in identification of 34 protein spots with significantly altered abundance. Upon MS analysis, 17 plasma proteins were identified: tetranectin, titin, clusterin, haptoglobin, myosin-13, zinc fnger protein 445, DNA repair protein RAD50, serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-IV, caspase-6, aminoacyl tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1, serotransferrin, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A-I and serum amyloid A. Comparable patterns of changes in tetranectin and titin between the control and AMI groups were confirmed using ELISA.

Newborn screening has been successful in markedly reducing the acute neonatal symptoms from this disorder. The dramatic response to dietary treatment is one of the major success stories of newborn screening. However, as children with galactosemia achieve adulthood, they face long-term complications. A majority of women with classic galactosemia develop primary ovarian insufficiency and resulting morbidity. The underlying pathophysiology of this complication is not clear. This review focuses on the reproductive issues seen in girls and women with classic galactosemia. Literature on the effects of classic galactosemia on the female reproductive system was reviewed by an extensive Pubmed search (publications from January 1975 to January 2017) using the keywords: galactosemia, ovarian function/dysfunction, primary ovarian insufficiency/failure, FSH, oxidative stress, fertility preservation. In addition, articles cited in the search articles and literature known to the authors was also included in the review. Our understanding of the role of galactose metabolism in the ovary is limited and the pathogenic mechanisms involved in causing primary ovarian insufficiency are unclear. The relative rarity of galactosemia makes it difficult to accumulate data to determine factors defining timing of ovarian dysfunction or treatment/fertility preservation options for this group of women.

In different disease models and targeting distinct organs, it has been demonstrated to revert the pathologic symptoms and signs. The therapeutic potential of hydrofection led different groups to work on the clinical translation of the procedure. In order to prevent the hemodynamic side effects derived from the rapid injection of a large volume, the conditions had to be moderated to make them compatible with its use in mid-size animal models such as rat, hamster and rabbit and large animals as dog, pig and primates. Despite the different approaches performed to adapt the conditions of gene delivery, the results obtained in any of these mid-size and large animals have been poorer than those obtained in murine model. Among these different strategies to reduce the volume employed, the most effective one has been to exclude the vasculature of the target organ and inject the solution directly. This procedure has permitted, by catheterization and surgical procedures in large animals, achieving protein expression levels in tissue close to those achieved in gold standard models.

Male ENU2 mice showed increased mGlu5 receptor protein levels in the hippocampus and corpus striatum (but not in the prefrontal cortex) whereas the transcript of the mGlu5 receptor was unchanged. No changes in mGlu1 receptor mRNA and protein levels were found in any of the three brain regions of ENU2 mice. We extended the analysis to Homer proteins, which act as scaffolds by linking mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors to effector proteins. Expression of the long isoforms of Homer was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of ENU2 mice, whereas levels of the short Homer isoform (Homer 1a) were unchanged. mGlu5 receptors were less associated to immunoprecipitated Homer in the hippocampus of ENU2 mice. The lack of mGlu5 receptor-mediated long-term depression (LTD) in wild-type mice (of BTBR strain) precluded the analysis of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in ENU2 mice. We therefore performed a behavioral analysis to examine whether pharmacological blockade of mGlu5 receptors could correct behavioral abnormalities in ENU2 mice. Using the same apparatus we sequentially assessed locomotor activity, object exploration, and spatial object recognition (spatial novelty test) after displacing some of the objects from their original position in the arena. Systemic treatment with the mGlu5 receptor antagonist, MPEP (20 mg/kg, i.p.), had a striking effect in the spatial novelty test by substantially increasing the time spent in exploring the displaced objects in ENU2 mice (but not in wild-type mice). These suggest a role for mGlu5 receptors in the pathophysiology of ID in PKU and suggest that, also in adult untreated animals, cognitive dysfunction may be improved by targeting these receptors with an appropriate therapy.Keywords: phenylketonuria, mGluR5, hippocampus, intellectual disability, ENU2 mice",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5864888/

Crude risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to quantify the excess risk of disease in French Guiana.ResultsIn French Guiana between 2005 and 2015 there were 666 deaths of children aged < 1 year, among which, 132 (19.8%) were due to congenital malformations and chromosomal anomalies. Overall the risk ratio of death from congenital malformations and chromosomal anomalies between French Guiana and mainland France was 2.7 (1.5–4.7), P < 0.001 for neurological congenital malformations it was 4.8 (1.2–19.7), P = 0.01 and for congenital malformations of the circulatory system it was 3.3 (1.5–6.9), P = 0.001.ConclusionsThe incidence of death from congenital malformations or chromosomal anomalies in French Guiana was significantly higher than in mainland France. Explanations for this may be infections, genetic causes, nutritional causes, and toxic causes that are prevalent. There is a need to identify factors that predispose children born in French Guiana to having a higher risk of congenital malformations and chromosomal anomalies.Keywords: Malformations, Circulatory apparatus, Neurological, Mortality, French Guiana",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303914/

The analysis of the concentration of food allergen residues in processing equipment, in raw materials or in the final product, provides analytical information that can be used for risk assessment as well as to ensure that food-allergic consumers get accurate and useful information to make their food choices and purchasing decisions. The development of biosensors based on nanomaterials for applications in food analysis is a challenging area of growing interest in the last years. Research in this field requires the combined efforts of experts in very different areas including food chemistry, biotechnology or materials science. However, the outcome of such collaboration can be of significant impact on the food industry as well as for consumer’s safety. These nanobiosensing devices allow the rapid, selective, sensitive, cost-effective and, in some cases, in-field, online and real-time detection of a wide range of compounds, even in complex matrices. Moreover, they can also enable the design of novel allergen detection strategies. Herein we review the main advances in the use of nanoparticles for the development of biosensors and bioassays for allergen detection, in food samples, over the past few years. Research in this area is still in its infancy in comparison, for instance, to the application of nanobiosensors for clinical analysis.

Low DHA intakes might explain subtle neurological deficits in PKU. We studied whether a DHA supply modified plasma DHA and neurological and intellectual functioning in PKU. In a double-blind multicentric trial, 109 PKU patients were randomized to DHA doses from 0 to 7 mg/kg&day for six months. Before and after supplementation, we determined plasma fatty acid concentrations, latencies of visually evoked potentials, fine and gross motor behavior, and IQ. Fatty acid desaturase genotypes were also determined. DHA supplementation increased plasma glycerophospholipid DHA proportional to dose by 0.4% DHA per 1 mg intake/kg bodyweight. Functional outcomes were not associated with DHA status before and after intervention and remained unchanged by supplementation. Genotypes were associated with plasma arachidonic acid levels and, if considered together with the levels of the precursor alpha-linolenic acid, also with DHA. Functional outcomes and supplementation effects were not significantly associated with genotype. DHA intakes up to 7 mg/kg did not improve neurological functions in PKU children. Nervous tissues may be less prone to low DHA levels after infancy, or higher doses might be required to impact neurological functions. In situations of minimal dietary DHA, endogenous synthesis of DHA from alpha-linolenic acid could relevantly contribute to DHA status.Keywords: phenylketonuria, docosahexaenoic acid, cognitive function, motor skills, neurological function",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6316534/

Current research regarding the serotonin system revolves around its dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders, but there is no database collating genetic mutations that result in serotonin abnormalities. To bridge this gap, we developed a list of genes in mice that, when perturbed, result in altered levels of serotonin either in brain or blood. Due to the intrinsic limitations of search, the current list should be considered a preliminary subset of all relevant cases. Nevertheless, it offered an opportunity to gain insight into what types of genes have the potential to impact serotonin by using gene ontology (GO). This analysis found that genes associated with monoamine metabolism were more often associated with increases in brain serotonin than decreases. Speculatively this could be because several pathways (and therefore many genes) are responsible for the clearance and metabolism of serotonin whereas only one pathway (and therefore fewer genes) is directly involved in the synthesis of serotonin. Another contributor could be cross talk between monoamine systems such as dopamine. In contrast, genes that were associated with decreases in brain serotonin were more likely linked to a developmental process. Sensitivity of serotonin neurons to developmental perturbations could due to their complicated neuroanatomy or possibly they may be negatively regulated by dysfunction of their innervation targets. Thus these observations suggest hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying the vulnerability of brain serotonin neurotransmission.Keywords: serotonin, neurodegenerative disease, gene ontology, raphe, dopamine, monoamine, platelet",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493142/

As a result, we aimed at addressing the effects, if any, of pyriproxyfen on neurodevelopment in the zebrafish embryo as a vertebrate model. Using zebrafish transgenic lines expressing GFP in different cell populations (elavl3 in newborn neurons, gfap and nestin in neural stem cells), we focused on the analysis of whole embryonic brain volume after confocal 3D-reconstruction and the quantification of purified neural stem cells during early neurodevelopment by FACS-cell sorting from whole in vivo embryos. Interestingly, though lethal at very high doses, pyriproxyfen did not cause brain malformation nor any significant changes in the number of observed stem cells in the developing central nervous system.

Identification of these factors and the proper quantification of their relevance provides insights into human biological and metabolic disease processes, is key for standardized translation of metabolite biomarkers into clinical applications, and is a prerequisite for comparability of data between studies. However, so far only limited data exist from large and well-phenotyped human cohorts and current methods for analysis do not fully account for the characteristics of these data. The primary aim of this study was to identify, quantify and compare the impact of a comprehensive set of clinical and lifestyle related factors on metabolite levels in three large human cohorts. To achieve this goal, we improve current methodology by developing a principled analysis approach, which could be translated to other cohorts and metabolite panels.Methods63 Metabolites (amino acids, acylcarnitines) were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in three cohorts (total N = 16,222). Supported by a simulation study evaluating various analytical approaches, we developed an analysis pipeline including preprocessing, identification, and quantification of factors affecting metabolite levels. We comprehensively identified uni- and multivariable metabolite associations considering 29 environmental and clinical factors and performed metabolic pathway enrichment and network analyses.ResultsInverse normal transformation of batch corrected and outlier removed metabolite levels accompanied by linear regression analysis proved to be the best suited method to deal with the metabolite data. Association analyses revealed numerous uni- and multivariable significant associations. 15 of the analyzed 29 factors explained >1% of variance for at least one of the metabolites. Strongest factors are application of steroid hormones, reticulocytes, waist-to-hip ratio, sex, haematocrit, and age. Effect sizes of factors are comparable across studies.ConclusionsWe introduced a principled approach for the analysis of MS data allowing identification, and quantification of effects of clinical and lifestyle factors with metabolite levels. We detected a number of known and novel associations broadening our understanding of the regulation of the human metabolome. The large heterogeneity observed between cohorts could almost completely be explained by differences in the distribution of influencing factors emphasizing the necessity of a proper confounder analysis when interpreting metabolite associations.Keywords: Amino acids, Acylcarnitines, Metabolomics, Clinical factors, Lifestyle factors, Network analysisAbbreviations: AA, amino acid; AC, acylcarnitine; BMI, body mass index; T2D, diabetes mellitus type 2; ATC, anatomical therapeutic chemical (code for medication); LDL, low-density lipoprotein; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; INT-LR, inverse normal transformation (INT) followed by linear regression (LR); WHR, waist-to-hip ratio; MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; BP, blood pressure",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6734104/

Although there are no known BH4 exogenous sources, the tissue content of this biopterin increases with age in GTP cyclohydrolase 1-deficient hyperphenylalaninemia-1 (hph-1) mice. Since certain bacteria are known to generate BH4, we hypothesize that generation of this biopterin by the intestinal microbiota contributes to its tissue increase in hph-1 adult mice. The goal of this study was to comparatively evaluate hph-1 mice and wild-type C57Bl/6 controls for the presence of intestinal BH4-producing bacteria. Newborn and adult mice fecal material was screened for 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS-2) an enzyme only present in BH4-generating bacteria. Adult, but not newborn, wild-type control and hph-1 mouse fecal material contained PTPS-2 mRNA indicative of the presence of BH4-generating bacteria. Utilizing chemostat-cultured human fecal bacteria, we identified the PTPS-2-producing bacteria as belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum. We further confirmed that at least two PTPS-2-producing species, Aldercreutzia equolifaciens and Microbacterium schleiferi, generate BH4 and are present in hph-1 fecal material.

Symptomatic newborns most frequently display hepatosplenomegaly, petechiae, jaundice, microcephaly, intrauterine growth restriction, chorioretinitis, purpura, and seizures. Progressive sensorineural hearing loss is the most prominent adverse outcome of both symptomatic and asymptomatic CMV infections in infants. We report the case of a three-month-old baby who presented with complaints of progressive jaundice for three months and a two days history of fever associated with one episode of fits. The baby was diagnosed with congenital CMV infection on the basis of positive CMV IgM and IgG and positive maternal serum CMV IgG. Finding a murmur on physical examination prompted echocardiography which revealed Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The child was managed with a 6-week course of ganciclovir after which his symptoms improved and he was referred to cardiology for the evaluation of his heart defect. Follow-ups at the clinic have shown normal growth and development. This is the first reported association of cCMV infection with TOF. This case highlights the need to consider the possibility of the presence of heart defects in all infants with cCMV infection in addition to neurodevelopmental abnormalities.

An alternative to this “microbiocentric view” is the idea that health-promoting effects of certain complex carbohydrates reside in the host, and could secondarily affect the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota. To circumvent this potential interpretational problem, we aimed at providing an overview about whether and how dietary supplementation of different complex carbohydrates changes the gut microbiome in healthy non-obese individuals. We then reviewed whether the reported changes in gut bacterial members found to be established by complex carbohydrates would benefit or harm the cardiometabolic and immunological health of the host taking into account the alterations in the microbiome composition and abundance known to be associated with obesity and its associated disorders. By combining these research areas, we aimed to give a better insight into the potential of (foods containing) complex carbohydrates in the treatment and prevention of above-mentioned diseases. We conclude that supplemental complex carbohydrates that increase Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, without increasing the deleterious Bacteroides, are most likely promoting cardiometabolic and immunological health in obese subjects. Because certain complex carbohydrates also affect the host’s immunity directly, it is likely that host–microbiome interactions in determination of health and disease characteristics are indeed bidirectional. Overall, this review article shows that whereas it is relatively clear in which direction supplemental fermentable carbohydrates can alter the gut microbiome, the relevance of these changes regarding health remains controversial.

Patients ≥12 years of age with PKU were systematically challenged with additional natural protein (NP) if blood Phe levels remained below 480 µmol/L (i.e., upper target blood Phe level for patients aged ≥12 years using Portuguese PKU guidelines). In PKU patients, NP tolerance was calculated at baseline and a median of 6 months after systematic challenge with NP whilst patients were maintaining a blood Phe ≤480 μmol/L. Anthropometry was assessed at both times. Routine blood Phe levels were collected. We studied 40 well-controlled PKU patients (10 hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), 23 mild and 7 classic PKU), on a low-Phe diet with a mean age of 17 years (12–29 years). Median daily NP intake significantly increased between assessments (35 vs. 40 g/day, p = 0.01). Twenty-six patients (65%) were able to increase their median NP intake by a median 12 g/day (2–42 g)/day and still maintain blood Phe within target range. Out of the previous 26 patients, 20 (77%) (8 HPA, 11 mild and 1 classical PKU) increased NP from animal sources (e.g., dairy products, fish and meat) and 6 patients (23%) (3 mild and 3 classical PKU) from plant foods (bread, pasta, potatoes). Median protein equivalent intake from Phe-free/low-Phe protein substitute decreased (0.82 vs. 0.75 g/kg, p = 0.01), while median blood Phe levels remained unchanged (279 vs. 288 μmol/L, p = 0.06). Almost two-thirds of patients with PKU tolerated additional NP when challenged and still maintained blood Phe within the national target range. This suggests that some patients with PKU treated by a low-Phe diet only may over restrict their NP intake.

While newborn screening has virtually eradicated intellectual disability due to severe congenital hypothyroidism in the developed world, more stringent screening strategies have resulted in increased detection of mild congenital hypothyroidism. Recent studies provide conflicting evidence about the potential neurodevelopmental risks posed by mild congenital hypothyroidism, highlighting the need for additional research to further define what risks these patients face and whether they are likely to benefit from treatment. Moreover, while the apparent incidence of congenital hypothyroidism has increased in recent decades, the underlying cause remains obscure in most cases. However, ongoing research into genetic causes of congenital hypothyroidism continues to shed new light on the development and physiology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. The identification of IGSF1 as a cause of central congenital hypothyroidism has uncovered potential new regulatory pathways in both pituitary thyrotropes and gonadotropes, while mounting evidence suggests that a significant proportion of primary congenital hypothyroidism may be caused by combinations of rare genetic variants in multiple genes involved in thyroid development and function.

Furthermore, in pediatric TBI, intrinsic developmental changes add further complexity, necessitating a biochemical dimension for improved TBI characterization. In our earlier study investigating the subacute stage TBI metabolome (72 h post-injury) in a developmental rat model, significant ipsilateral brain biochemical changes occurred across 25 metabolite sets as determined by metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA). The broad metabolic perturbation was accompanied by behavioral deficits and neuronal loss across the ipsilateral hemisphere containing the injury epicenter. In order to obtain a consolidated biochemical profile of the TBI assessment, a subgrouping of the 190 identified brain metabolites was performed. Metabolites were divided into seven major subgroups: oxidative energy/mitochondrial, glycolysis/pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid, amino acid, neurotransmitters/neuromodulators, one-carbon/folate and other metabolites. Subgroups were based on the chemical nature and association with critically altered biochemical pathways after TBI as obtained from our earlier untargeted analysis. Each metabolite subgroup extracted from the ipsilateral sham and TBI brains were modeled using multivariate partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) with the model accuracy used as a measurable index of TBI neurochemical impact. Volcano plots of each subgroup, corrected for multiple comparisons, determined the TBI neurochemical specificity.

The present study compared HRQoL scores in core dimensions of Brazilian early-treated PKU pediatric patients with those of a reference population, and explored possible relationships between adherence to treatment and HRQoL. Early-treated PKU pediatric patient HRQoL was evaluated by self- and parent-proxy reports of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) core scales. Adherence to treatment was evaluated by median Phe levels and percentage of results within the therapeutic target range in two periods. Means for total and core scales scores of PedsQL self- and parent proxy-reports of PKU patients were significantly lower than their respective means for controls. Adequacy of median Phe concentrations and the mean percentage of values in the target range fell substantially from the first year of life to the last year of this study. There was no significant difference in mean total and core scale scores for self- and parent proxy-reports between patients with adequate and those with inadequate median Phe concentrations. The harmful consequences for intellectual capacity caused by poor adherence to dietary treatment could explain the observed decrease in all HRQoL scales, especially in school functioning.

Based on the results, it seems that participants having rs174537 mutant allele are more prone to become diabetic but it has a beneficial effect on total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and participants having rs174575 mutant are less prone to become diabetic, and also, it leads to higher triglycerides and body mass index (obesity).Conclusions:Detecting FADS1 and FADS2, gene polymorphisms using HRM can be an anticipating tool for making decision on initiating lifestyle modifications to prevent type 2 diabetes.Keywords: Fatty acid desaturase gene, polymorphism, type 2 diabetic",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6036782/

recommended to aid in establishing working diagnoses that facilitate
appropriate biochemical and genetic investigations. This retrospective pilot
study investigated the validity and diagnostic utility of this algorithm
when applied to white matter signal abnormalities (WMSAs) reported on
imaging studies of patients seen in our clinics.MethodsThe MRI algorithm was applied to 31 patients selected from patients attending
the neurometabolic/neurogenetic/metabolic/neurology clinics at a tertiary
care hospital. These patients varied in age from 5 months to 79 years old,
and were reported to have WMSAs on cranial MRI scans. Twenty-one patients
had confirmed WMA diagnoses and 10 patients had non-specific WMA diagnoses
(etiology unknown). Two radiologists, blinded to confirmed diagnoses, used
clinical abstracts and the WMSAs present on patient MRI scans to classify
possible WMA diagnoses utilizing the algorithm.ResultsThe MRI algorithm displayed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 30.0% and
a positive predicted value of 74.1%. Cohen’s kappa statistic for
inter-radiologist agreement was 0.733, suggesting “good” agreement between

Furthermore, numerous studies on BH4-sensitive PAH deficiency have been conducted. To date, BH4, a cofactor of PAH, has not been used to treat PKU in Russia.Genotype data of patients with PKU can be used to predict their sensitivity to BH4 therapy. A cohort of 2579 patients with PKU from Russia was analyzed for 25 common PAH gene mutations using custom allele-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification-based technology. A mutation detection rate of 84.1% chromosomes was accomplished. Both pathogenic alleles were identified in 73.1% of patients. The most frequent pathogenic variants were p.Arg408Trp (50.9%), p.Arg261Gln (5.3%), p.Pro281Leu (3.5%), IVS12+1G>A (3.1%), IVS10-11G>A (2.6%), and p.Arg158Leu (2.4%).

However, toxicity and/or lack of efficacy are produced when unintended targets are affected in metabolic networks. Thus, identification of biological targets which can be manipulated to produce the desired effect with minimum side-effects has become an important and challenging topic. Efficient computational methods are required to identify the drug targets while incurring minimal side-effects.ResultsIn this paper, we propose a graph-based computational damage model that summarizes the impact of enzymes on compounds in metabolic networks. An efficient method based on Integer Linear Programming formalism is then developed to identify the optimal enzyme-combination so as to minimize the side-effects. The identified target enzymes for known successful drugs are then verified by comparing the results with those in the existing literature.ConclusionsSide-effects reduction plays a crucial role in the study of drug development.

Dietary factors, physical inactivity, and sedentary behaviors are the major modifiable risk factors for obesity. Nevertheless, many overweight/obese people do not develop diabetes and lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss and diabetes prevention are often ineffective. Traditionally, chronically elevated blood glucose concentrations have been the hallmark of diabetes; however, many individuals will either remain ‘prediabetic’ or regress to normoglycemia. Thus, there is a growing need for innovative strategies to tackle diabetes at scale. The emergence of biomarker technologies has allowed more targeted therapeutic strategies for diabetes prevention (precision medicine), though largely confined to pharmacotherapy. Unlike most drugs, lifestyle interventions often have systemic health-enhancing effects. Thus, the pursuance of lifestyle precision medicine in diabetes seems rational.

Most individuals with HPA harbor mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), and a small proportion (2%) exhibit tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency with additional neurotransmitter (dopamine and serotonin) deficiency. Here we report six individuals from four unrelated families with HPA who exhibited progressive neurodevelopmental delay, dystonia, and a unique profile of neurotransmitter deficiencies without mutations in PAH or BH4 metabolism disorder-related genes. In these six affected individuals, whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified biallelic mutations in DNAJC12, which encodes a heat shock co-chaperone family member that interacts with phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylases catalyzing the BH4-activated conversion of phenylalanine into tyrosine, tyrosine into L-dopa (the precursor of dopamine), and tryptophan into 5-hydroxytryptophan (the precursor of serotonin), respectively. DNAJC12 was undetectable in fibroblasts from the individuals with null mutations. PAH enzyme activity was reduced in the presence of DNAJC12 mutations. Early treatment with BH4 and/or neurotransmitter precursors had dramatic beneficial effects and resulted in the prevention of neurodevelopmental delay in the one individual treated before symptom onset. Thus, DNAJC12 deficiency is a preventable and treatable cause of intellectual disability that should be considered in the early differential diagnosis when screening results are positive for HPA.

Fourteen survivors of childhood brain tumor aged 7–18 years, who were off-treatment for at least 1 year and were in remission, and 31 unrelated healthy controls were recruited. The median age at diagnosis was 8.20 years (range: 0.92–12.96 years). The diagnoses of brain tumors were medulloblastoma, germ cell tumor, pineocytoma, pilocystic astrocytoma, suprasellar germinoma, and ependymoma. Eleven survivors received central nervous system irradiation. Seven tasks were selected from the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks program to evaluate alertness (processing speed), and major aspects of executive functioning, such as working memory capacity, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and sustained attention. Speed, stability and accuracy of responses were the main outcome measures.Results: Survivors of childhood brain tumor showed statistically significant poorer performance on all tasks compared to healthy controls. Both processing speed and accuracy were impaired in the survivors, in particular under more complex task conditions. The survivors demonstrated deficits in alertness, sustained attention, working memory capacity, executive visuomotor control, and cognitive flexibility. Longer duration off treatment appeared to be correlated with poorer alertness, memory capacity, and inhibition.Conclusion: Survivors of childhood brain tumor in our center showed impaired neuropsychological functioning.

We report on a number of universal topological relationships with SO that are true for all binary trees and distinguish those from SO-sorted metric measures that appear to be cell type-specific. The latter are therefore potential new candidates for categorising dendritic tree structures. Interestingly, we find a faithful correlation of branch diameters with centripetal branch orders, indicating a possible functional importance of SO for dendritic morphology and growth. Also, simulated local voltage responses to synaptic inputs are strongly correlated with SO.

Participants had a higher probability of quitting in blocks with the higher reward rate. Furthermore, participants who consumed the caloric drink had a higher probability of quitting than those who consumed water.

Introduction: This study is part of the “European network and registry for intoxication type metabolic diseases” (E-IMD) project. Intoxication-type inborn errors of metabolism (IT-IEM) such as urea cycle disorders (UCD) and organic acidurias (OA) have a major impact on patients’ lives. Patients have to adhere to strict diet and medication and may suffer from metabolic crises and neurocognitive impairment. Disease-specific health-related quality of life (HrQoL) assessment questionnaires are the method of choice to estimate the subjective burden of a disease. To date, no such instrument is available for IT-IEM.
Methods: Disease-specific patient- and parent-reported HrQoL questions were constructed in German based on focus group interviews with patients and parents. Questionnaires for patients from 8 to 18 years were piloted with 14 participants (n = 9 children and adolescents, n = 5 parents) by cognitive debriefing and tested psychometrically with 80 participants (n = 38 patients, n = 42 parents) for item characteristics, validity, and reliability to construct the first version of a disease-specific HrQoL questionnaire.
Results: Twenty-eight questions were selected based on item descriptives. Scales of self- and proxy questionnaires demonstrated acceptable to excellent reliability in terms of internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.70–0.93). Scales and total scores correlated with those of generic HrQoL questionnaires, showing convergent validity.
Discussion: The MetabQoL 1.0 questionnaire exhibits sound psychometric properties and is a promising step towards assessing patient-reported outcomes in research and clinical practice. It provides a solid basis for translation into other languages and further elaboration and psychometric exploration in larger populations.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this chapter (doi:10.1007/8904_2017_11) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Inborn errors of metabolism, Organic acidurias, Quality of life, Questionnaire, Urea cycle disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5740049/

68,10.3390/jcm6070071,28753922,"Go to:AbstractMitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases and conditions. Oxidative stress occurs once the antioxidant defenses of the body become overwhelmed and are no longer able to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS can then go unchallenged and are able to cause oxidative damage to cellular lipids, DNA and proteins, which will eventually result in cellular and organ dysfunction. Although not always the primary cause of disease, mitochondrial dysfunction as a secondary consequence disease of pathophysiology can result in increased ROS generation together with an impairment in cellular energy status. Mitochondrial dysfunction may result from either free radical-induced oxidative damage or direct impairment by the toxic metabolites which accumulate in certain metabolic diseases. In view of the importance of cellular antioxidant status, a number of therapeutic strategies have been employed in disorders associated with oxidative stress with a view to neutralising the ROS and reactive nitrogen species implicated in disease pathophysiology. Although successful in some cases, these adjunct therapies have yet to be incorporated into the clinical management of patients.

Disturbed sleep may exacerbate the core symptoms of ASD. Behavioural interventions and supplemental melatonin medication are traditionally used to improve sleep quality, but poor sustainability of behavioural intervention effects and use of other medications that metabolise melatonin may degrade the effectiveness of these interventions. However, several studies have suggested that physical activity may provide an effective intervention for treating sleep disturbance in typically developing children. Thus, we designed a study to examine whether such an intervention is also effective in children with ASD. We present a protocol (4 December 2017) for a jogging intervention with a parallel and two-group randomised controlled trial design using objective actigraphic assessment and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin measurement to determine whether a 12-week physical activity intervention elicits changes in sleep quality or melatonin levels.Methods and analysisAll eligible participants will be randomly allocated to either a jogging intervention group or a control group receiving standard care. Changes in sleep quality will be monitored through actigraphic assessment and parental sleep logs. All participants will also be instructed to collect a 24-hour urine sample. 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, a creatinine-adjusted morning urinary melatonin representative of the participant’s melatonin levels, will be measured from the sample. All assessments will be carried out before the intervention (T1), immediately after the 12-week intervention or regular treatment (T2), 6 weeks after the intervention (T3) and 12 weeks after the intervention (T4) to examine the sustainability of the intervention effects. The first enrolment began in February 2018.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval was obtained through the Human Research Ethics Committee, Education University of Hong Kong.

In this review, we present animal models, particularly rats and mice, which have been extensively used by scientists to understand the consequences of diet quality on weight gain and health. Notably, modulation of dietary protein quantity and/or quality has been shown to exert huge effects on body composition homeostasis through the modulation of food intake, energy expenditure, and metabolic pathways. Interestingly, the perinatal window appears to represent a critical period during which the protein intake of the dam can impact the offspring’s weight gain and feeding behavior. Animal models are also widely used to understand the processes and mechanisms that contribute to obesity at different physiological and pathophysiological stages. An interesting example of such aspect is the situation of decreased estrogen level occurring at menopause, which is linked to weight gain and decreased energy expenditure. To study metabolic disorders associated with such situation, estrogen withdrawal in ovariectomized animal models to mimic menopause are frequently used. According to many studies, clear species-specific differences exist between rats and mice that need to be taken into account when results are extrapolated to humans.Keywords: animal models, obesity, body composition, dietary protein, food intake, energy expenditure, estrogen deficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357654/

The primary aim of weaning is to gradually replace natural protein from breast milk or standard infant formula with solids containing equivalent phenylalanine (Phe). In addition, a Phe-free second stage L-amino acid supplement is usually recommended from around 6 months to replace Phe-free infant formula. Our aim was to assess different weaning approaches used by health professionals across Europe.MethodsA cross sectional questionnaire (survey monkey®) composed of 31 multiple and single choice questions was sent to European colleagues caring for inherited metabolic disorders (IMD). Centres were grouped into geographical regions for analysis.ResultsWeaning started at 17–26 weeks in 85% (n = 81/95) of centres, >26 weeks in 12% (n = 11/95) and < 17 weeks in 3% (n = 3/95). Infant's showing an interest in solid foods, and their age, were important determinant factors influencing weaning commencement. 51% (n = 48/95) of centres introduced Phe containing foods at 17–26 weeks and 48% (n = 46/95) at >26 weeks. First solids were mainly low Phe vegetables (59%, n = 56/95) and fruit (34%, n = 32/95).A Phe exchange system to allocate dietary Phe was used by 52% (n = 49/95) of centres predominantly from Northern and Southern Europe and 48% (n = 46/95) calculated most Phe containing food sources (all centres in Eastern Europe and the majority from Germany and Austria). Some centres used a combination of both methods.A second stage Phe-free L-amino acid supplement containing a higher protein equivalent was introduced by 41% (n = 39/95) of centres at infant age 26–36 weeks (mainly from Germany, Austria, Northern and Eastern Europe) and 37% (n = 35/95) at infant age > 1y mainly from Southern Europe. 53% (n = 50/95) of centres recommended a second stage Phe-free L-amino acid supplement in a spoonable or semi-solid form.ConclusionsWeaning strategies vary throughout European PKU centres. There is evidence to suggest that different infant weaning strategies may influence longer term adherence to the PKU diet or acceptance of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements; rendering prospective long-term studies important.

To this end, we compared intelligence and white matter integrity prior to treatment with BH4 in 13 subsequent BH4 responders with PKU, 16 subsequent BH4 non-responders with PKU, and 12 healthy controls. Results indicated poorer intelligence and white matter integrity in non-responders compared to responders prior to treatment. In addition, poorer white matter integrity was associated with greater variability in Phe across the lifetime in non-responders but not in responders.

However, these figures are likely to be affected by the current broader criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which have contributed to an increased prevalence of autism, with the result that the rate for ASD in epilepsy is likely to be higher and the figure for epilepsy in ASD is likely to be lower. Some evidence suggests that there are two peaks of epilepsy onset in autism, in infancy and adolescence. The rate of autism in epilepsy is much higher in those with intellectual disability. In conditions such as the Landau–Kleffner syndrome and nonconvulsive status epilepticus, the epilepsy itself may present with autistic features. There is no plausible mechanism for autism causing epilepsy, however. The co-occurrence of autism and epilepsy is almost certainly the result of underlying factors predisposing to both conditions, including both genetic and environmental factors. Conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and sleep disorders are common in both epilepsy and autism. Epilepsy is generally not a contraindication to treating these conditions with suitable medication, but it is important to take account of relevant drug interactions. One of the greatest challenges in autism is to determine why early childhood regression occurs in perhaps 25%. Further research should focus on finding the cause for such regression.

This hypothesis is supported by observed long-term benefits associated with breastfeeding, such as better cognitive development in childhood, and lower risks of obesity and high blood pressure in later life. However, the possible underlying mechanisms are expected to be complex and may be difficult to disentangle due to the lack of understanding of the metabolic processes that differentiate breastfed infants compared to those receiving just formula feed.ObjectiveOur aim was to investigate the relationships between infant feeding and the lipid profiles and to validate specific lipids in separate datasets so that a small set of lipids can be used as nutritional biomarkers.MethodWe utilized a direct infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry method to analyse the lipid profiles of 3.2 mm dried blood spot samples collected at age 3 months from the Cambridge Baby Growth Study (CBGS-1), which formed the discovery cohort. For validation two sample sets were profiled: Cambridge Baby Growth Study (CBGS-2) and Pregnancy Outcome Prediction Study (POPS). Lipidomic profiles were compared between infant groups who were either exclusively breastfed, exclusively formula-fed or mixed-fed at various levels. Data analysis included supervised Random Forest method with combined classification and regression mode. Selection of lipids was based on an iterative backward elimination procedure without compromising the class error in the classification mode.ConclusionFrom this study, we were able to identify and validate three lipids: PC(35:2), SM(36:2) and SM(39:1) that can be used collectively as biomarkers for infant nutrition during early development.

For many years the regulation of practices was self-imposed, decentralised and idiosyncratic. The advent of ‘therapeutic modernity’ in the 1990s gave rise to an ethical, legal and scientific framework designed to homogenise PND at a national level, with the creation of multidisciplinary centres (CPDPN) and the Agence de la biomédecine. This article first recovers the history of PND in France. It then compares the activities of two CPDPNs, using ethnographic fieldwork and by analysing national quantitative data compiled by the Agence. It argues that the official policy of nationally homogeneous practices is not born out in practice, at the local level. This lack of homogeneity is most apparent in the number of authorisations for pregnancy termination due to foetal malformation, which varies considerably from one centre to another. Rooted in local culture, this variation relates to organisational methods, decision-making processes and variable levels of tolerance towards the risk of disability. Foetal medicine practitioners, thus, maintain a certain amount of autonomy that is collective rather than individual and that is reflected in the particular ‘identity’ of a given centre.

Whole-exome sequencing was performed, and sequences were analyzed with a specific focus on genes related to NBS. Results were compared to the known pathogenic mutations previously identified by Sanger sequencing. Causal mutations were readily characterized, and multiple polymorphisms have been identified. According to variant database prediction, an unexplained homozygote pathogenic mutation, unrelated to patient’s disorder, was also found in one sample.

Current treatment consists of 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) and a tyrosine and phenylalanine restricted diet. Recently, neuropsychological deficits have been seen in HT1 patients. These deficits are possibly associated with low blood phenylalanine concentrations and/or high blood tyrosine concentrations. Therefore, the aim of the present study was threefold. Firstly, we aimed to calculate how the plasma amino acid profile in HT1 patients may influence the presumptive brain influx of all large neutral amino acids (LNAA). Secondly, we aimed to investigate the effect of phenylalanine supplementation on presumptive brain phenylalanine and tyrosine influx. Thirdly, we aimed to theoretically determine minimal target plasma phenylalanine concentrations in HT1 patient to ensure adequate presumptive brain phenylalanine influx.MethodsData of plasma LNAA concentrations were obtained. In total, 239 samples of 9 HT1 children, treated with NTBC, diet, and partly with phenylalanine supplementation were collected together with 596 samples of independent control children. Presumptive brain influx of all LNAA was calculated, using Michaelis-Menten parameters (Km) and Vmax-values obtained from earlier articles.ResultsIn HT1 patients, plasma concentrations and presumptive brain influx of tyrosine were higher. However, plasma and especially brain influx of phenylalanine were lower in HT1 patients. Phenylalanine supplementation did not only tend to increase plasma phenylalanine concentrations, but also presumptive brain phenylalanine influx, despite increased plasma tyrosine concentrations. However, to ensure sufficient brain phenylalanine influx in HT1 patients, minimal plasma phenylalanine concentrations may need to be higher than considered thus far.ConclusionThis study clearly suggests a role for disturbed brain LNAA biochemistry, which is not well reflected by plasma LNAA concentrations. This could play a role in the pathophysiology of the neuropsychological impairments in HT1 patients and may have therapeutic implications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5614617/

However, priming of OCp away from bone, such as in inflammatory tissues, as revealed in peripheral blood, may represent a second pathway, particularly relevant in individuals who suffer from systemic bone loss such as prevalent in inflammatory diseases. In this review, we used a systematic approach to review the literature on osteoclast formation in peripheral blood in patients with inflammatory diseases associated with bone loss. Only studies that compared inflammatory (bone) disease with healthy controls in the same study were included. Using this core collection, it becomes clear that experimental osteoclastogenesis using peripheral blood from patients with bone loss diseases in prevalent diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, periodontitis, and cancer-related osteopenia unequivocally point toward an intrinsically increased osteoclast formation and activation. In particular, such increased osteoclastogenesis already takes place without the addition of the classical osteoclastogenesis cytokines M-CSF and RANKL in vitro. We show that T-cells and monocytes as OCp are the minimal demands for such unstimulated osteoclast formation. In search for common and disease-specific denominators of the diseases with inflammation-driven bone loss, we demonstrate that altered T-cell activity and a different composition—such as the CD14+CD16+ vs. CD14+CD16– monocytes—and priming of OCp with increased M-CSF, RANKL, and TNF- α levels in peripheral blood play a role in increased osteoclast formation and activity.

While it was unclear how prevalent genetic discrimination was, GINA was enacted preemptively to prevent discrimination in insurance and employment. It also created uniform protections to remedy a confusing patchwork of state and federal protections. Finally, Congress hoped GINA would allay public fears of genetic discrimination that discouraged people from undergoing genetic testing and participating in genetics research. To address those fears, Congress enacted robust protections against genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment, in part, by defining ‘genetic information’ as broadly as possible.Over the last ten years, however, the courts have been battling over the meaning of ‘genetic information’. One interpretive approach adheres strictly to GINA's statutory language; the second interprets the definition restrictively and contrary to the plain meaning of GINA and its underlying goals. While this interpretive conflict demonstrates the difficulty of distinguishing genetic information from non-medical information, this article argues for the broader interpretation. Such an interpretation reflects Congress's choice among imperfect definitional options and it furthers the goal of creating strong protections in health insurance and employment.

Haploinsufficiency of the RERE gene might contribute to different phenotypes seen in individuals with 1p36 deletions. We describe a neonate of an obese mother, diagnosed with type IV LTEC and type III esophageal atresia (EA), in which a 1p36 deletion including the RERE gene was detected. On the second day of life, a right thoracotomy and extrapleural esophagus atresia repair were attempted. One week later, a right cervical approach was performed to separate the cervical esophagus from the trachea. Three months later, a thoracic termino-terminal anastomosis of the esophagus was performed. An anterior fundoplication was required at 8 months of age due to severe gastroesophageal reflux and failure to thrive. A causal role of 1p36 deletions including the RERE gene in the malformation is proposed. Moreover, additional parental factors must be considered. Future studies are mandatory to elucidate genomic and epigenomic susceptibility factors that underlie these congenital malformations.

As proposed by the triage theory, a modest deficiency of one of the nutrients/cofactors triggers a built-in rationing mechanism that favors the proteins needed for immediate survival and reproduction (survival proteins) while sacrificing those needed to protect against future damage (longevity proteins). Impairment of the function of longevity proteins results in an insidious acceleration of the risk of diseases associated with aging. I also propose that nutrients required for the function of longevity proteins constitute a class of vitamins that are here named “longevity vitamins.” I suggest that many such nutrients play a dual role for both survival and longevity. The evidence for classifying taurine as a conditional vitamin, and the following 10 compounds as putative longevity vitamins, is reviewed: the fungal antioxidant ergothioneine; the bacterial metabolites pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and queuine; and the plant antioxidant carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, α- and β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and the marine carotenoid astaxanthin.

somnolence and signs of dehydration,with dry mouth, increasing body
temperature and adipsy. As days went by, the symptoms got worse. The infant
was very sleepy and was transferred to the intensive care unit, where he

Phe levels can be controlled following a protein-free diet, but cognitive impairments are still present. A number of questions remain to be answered related to which type of metabolic control is important, the age when it is important, the cognitive functions which are most affected and, the best tests to use to monitor cognitive health. Method: We investigated the impact of metabolic control at different ages on cognitive performance in 37 early treated adults with PKU. Results: (a) Phe variation was as associated to performance as average Phe showing that stable dietary control is as important as strict control; (b) For some tasks, current and adult Phe were stronger predictors of performance than childhood or adolescent Phe, showing the importance of a strict diet even in adulthood; and (c) The relationship between performance and Phe levels varied depending on time and cognitive domain. For some functions (sustained attention, visuomotor coordination), Phe at the time of testing was the best predictor. While for other functions (visual attention, executive functions) there was a diminishing or stable relationship across time. Conclusion: Results show the importance of selecting the right tasks to monitor outcomes across ages, but also that the impact of bio-chemical disruptions is different for different functions, at different ages.

Recently, different home delivery services have been introduced to support patient access of low protein foods, but the effectiveness of these services is unclear.AimA prospective, longitudinal, observational study to examine the effectiveness and safety of patient home delivery services for LP foods over 12 months in IMD patients requiring a LP diet.MethodsIMD patients/caregivers had the choice of 2 home delivery services (Homeward® and Vitaflo at Home®) as well as access to primary care pharmacy services. Both home delivery services provided a limited range of LP foods. Over a 12-month period, a member of the IMD dietetic team conducted 4 home visits to IMD patients on LP diets using home delivery services for low protein foods. At each visit, caregivers completed a questionnaire consisting of 20 multiple choice and open questions about their prescription experience with special LP foods. The researchers also completed stock checks, assessed ‘use by dates’ and adequacy of home storage for LP foods.ResultsIn total, 58 patients participated in this study. Over 12 months, 95% (n = 55/58) of caregivers used their local pharmacy, 93% (n = 54/58) Homeward® and 78% (n = 45/58) Vitaflo at Home® to access LP foods. Two home delivery services were used by 41 (71%) caregivers and the remaining 17 (29%) only used one of the home delivery service companies. Each patient only stored a median of 6 (range 0–22) different LP foods at home. Overall, 45% (n = 26/58) of caregivers reported problems with their GP prescriptions. 30% (n = 16/53) of caregivers received at least one incorrect prescription when using their pharmacy (e.g. gluten-free foods instead of LP, incorrect product or incorrect product amount), 6% errors (n = 3/53) with Homeward® and 2% (n = 1/48) with Vitaflo at Home®. 49% (n = 26/53) of caregivers said they experienced delayed receipt of LP foods from their pharmacy, compared with 11% (n = 6/55) from Homeward® and 8% (n = 4/48) Vitaflo at Home®.ConclusionsAlthough home delivery services for special LP foods are associated with less errors and delay compared with pharmacies, inaccuracies and inefficiencies still occur and the overall system is complex. We suggest a new, simpler, less fragmented system whereby metabolic dietitians prescribe LP foods.

This seminal work published in Nature in the early 70’s, in conjunction with many other studies, later served as the basis for the development of the narcotic antagonist (NTX) now used to treat both alcohol and opioid dependence. In 2006 an extended-release injectable of Naltrexone (XR-NTX) was approved by the FDA. Naltrexone is a relatively weak antagonist of κ- and δ-receptors and is also a potent μ-receptor antagonist. Dosages of naltrexone that effectively reduce opioid and alcohol consumption also actively block μ-receptors, but chronically down-regulate mesolimbic dopamine release. While studies show benefit especially in the short term, there is ongoing evidence that the retention and compliance with NTX are not sufficient to characterize adherence as high. However, extended-release NTX opioid treatment is associated with superior outcomes including less likely relapse (defined as daily use), and much longer time to relapse despite higher rates of concurrent non-opioid substance use like cocaine. Regarding long-term extended-release injectable (XR-NTX) for opioid dependence; there was higher compliance with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) than for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD.). Consideration of modalities in combination with XR-NTX is imperative.

To reduce the cost of time and temperature-sensitive shipping, we selected Guthrie cards, developed for newborn screening, to collect dried blood spots (DBS), as a source of DNA that can be shipped by regular mail at minimal cost.MethodBlood was collected and blotted onto the filter paper of Guthrie cards by completely filling three circles. We enrolled 20 male patients with presumptive X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) cared for at the Vietnam National Children’s Hospital, their mothers, and several sisters for carrier analysis. DBS were stored at room temperature until ready to be shipped together, using an appropriately sized envelope, to a CLIA-certified laboratory in the US for sequencing. The protocol for Sanger sequencing was modified to account for the reduced quantity of gDNA extracted from DBS.ResultHigh-quality gDNA could be extracted from every specimen. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) mutations were identified in 17 of 20 patients studied, confirming the diagnosis of XLA in 85% of the study cohort. Type and location of the mutations were similar to those reported in previous reviews. The mean age when XLA was suspected clinically was 4.6 years, similar to that reported by Western countries. Two of 15 mothers, each with an affected boy, had a normal BTK sequence, suggesting gonadal mosaicism.ConclusionDBS collected on Guthrie cards can be shipped inexpensively by airmail across continents, providing sufficient high-quality gDNA for Sanger sequencing overseas.

NMR spectroscopy was used to assess concentrations of four urinary metabolites that have been previously associated with FGR (tyrosine, acetate, formate, and trimethylamine) in first and second trimester urine samples. We fit multivariate conditional logistic regression models to estimate the odds of FGR in relation to urinary concentrations of these individual metabolites in the first and second trimesters. Exploratory analyses of custom binned spectroscopy results were run to consider other potentially related metabolites.ResultsWe found no significant association between the relative concentrations of each of the four metabolites and odds of FGR.

Personalized nutrition in athletic populations aims to optimize health, body composition, and exercise performance by targeting dietary recommendations to an individual's genetic profile. Sport dietitians and nutritionists have long been adept at placing additional scrutiny on the one-size-fits-all general population dietary guidelines to accommodate various sporting populations. However, generic “one-size-fits-all” recommendations still remain. Genetic differences are known to impact absorption, metabolism, uptake, utilization and excretion of nutrients and food bioactives, which ultimately affects a number of metabolic pathways. Nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics are experimental approaches that use genomic information and genetic testing technologies to examine the role of individual genetic differences in modifying an athlete's response to nutrients and other food components. Although there have been few randomized, controlled trials examining the effects of genetic variation on performance in response to an ergogenic aid, there is a growing foundation of research linking gene-diet interactions on biomarkers of nutritional status, which impact exercise and sport performance. This foundation forms the basis from which the field of sport nutrigenomics continues to develop.

In this explorative study, we investigated possible sleep problems in adult treated PKU patients and untreated PKU mice. In the PKU patients, sleep characteristics were compared to healthy first degree relatives by assessment of sleep disturbances, sleep–wake patterns, and sleepiness with the help of four questionnaires: Holland sleep disorder questionnaire, Pittsburgh sleep quality index, Epworth sleepiness scale, and Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. The results obtained with the questionnaires show that PKU individuals suffer more from sleep disorders, a reduced sleep quality, and an increased latency to fall asleep and experience more sleepiness during the day. In the PKU mice, activity patterns were recorded with passive infrared recorders. PKU mice switched more often between active and non-active behavior and shifted a part of their resting behavior into the active period, confirming that sleep quality is affected as a consequence of PKU.

Mutant alleles accumulation in populations may be one of them due to strong heritability of many cancers. The opportunity for the operation of natural selection has decreased in the past ~150 years because of reduction in mortality and fertility. Mutation‐selection balance may have been disturbed in this process and genes providing background for some cancers may have been accumulating in human gene pools. Worldwide, based on the WHO statistics for 173 countries the index of the opportunity for selection is strongly inversely correlated with cancer incidence in peoples aged 0–49 years and in people of all ages. This relationship remains significant when gross domestic product per capita (GDP), life expectancy of older people (e
50), obesity, physical inactivity, smoking and urbanization are kept statistically constant for fifteen (15) of twenty‐seven (27) individual cancers incidence rates. Twelve (12) cancers which are not correlated with relaxed natural selection after considering the six potential confounders are largely attributable to external causes like viruses and toxins. Ratios of the average cancer incidence rates of the 10 countries with lowest opportunities for selection to the average cancer incidence rates of the 10 countries with highest opportunities for selection are 2.3 (all cancers at all ages), 2.4 (all cancers in 0–49 years age group), 5.7 (average ratios of strongly genetically based cancers) and 2.1 (average ratios of cancers with less genetic background).Keywords: biological state index, cancer heritability, life expectancy, mutations",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775494/

Genetic testing during newborn screening (NBS) for CF can identify less common mutations with low clinical expression in childhood and previously considered mild but not fully characterized, such as the mutation p.Val232Asp (c.695T > A). The aim of this study was to describe CF patients with the V232D mutation. We identify CF children with the V232D mutation detected by NBS and compare them with CF adults with this mutation whose diagnosis was prompted by clinical symptoms in the same period. We studied clinical, biochemical, spirometric, and prognostic features in both populations. NBS program tested 276,523 children during a period of 14 years (2003–2017) and identified 54 cases of CF. Six children (11%) had the V232D mutation. Over the same period, 5 adults (age 37.6 ± 16.29 years old) with symptoms of CF and this mutation were also diagnosed. Follow-up duration was mean 10.1 years for adults and mean 6.5 years for children. In the adult group, lung function was impaired at diagnosis in all patients (Forced Expiratory Volume1—FEV1—67.12% ± 13.09) and worsened in children tested during evolution (FEV1first: 113%; FEV1last: 64%). Pancreatic insufficiency was present in adult group, with recurrent pancreatitis in 1 present. Although with less clinical expression in children, V232D is associated with pulmonary and pancreatic involvement during adulthood and CF cannot be considered mild. This mutation is present in 11% of all patients diagnosed with CF in our region. Its inclusion in some NBS programs should be taken into account in order to improve the prognosis of affected children.Keywords: CFTR, genetic testing, lung function, newborn screening, pancreatic insufficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6076148/

Using proteomics and metabolomics approach, we found that cysteine up-regulates proteins involved in amino acid metabolism, alters amino acid levels, and inhibits protein translation—events that are rescued by leucine supplementation. Through a comprehensive genetic screen, we show that leucine-mediated effect depends on a transfer RNA methyltransferase (NCL1), absence of which decouples transcription and translation in the cell, inhibits the conversion of leucine to ketoisocaproate, and leads to tricarboxylic acid cycle block.

Timely diagnosis and treatment of these disorders can have lasting effects on the mental development of newborns. However, there are several problems at different stages of screening programs that along with imposing heavy costs can reduce the precision of the screening, increasing the chance of undiagnosed cases which in turn can have damaging consequences for the society. Therefore, given these problems and the importance of information systems in facilitating the management and improving the quality of health care the aim of this study was to improve the screening process of hypothyroidism and PKU in infants with the help of electronic resources.Methods:The current study is a qualitative, action research designed to improve the quality of screening, services, performance, implementation effectiveness, and management of hypothyroidism and PKU screening program in Isfahan province. To this end, web-based software was designed. Programming was carried out using Delphi.net software and used SQL Server 2008 for database management.Findings:Given the weaknesses, problems, and limitations of hypothyroidism and PKU screening program, and the importance of these diseases in a national scale, this study resulted in design of hypothyroidism and PKU screening software for infants in Isfahan province. The inputs and outputs of the software were designed in three levels including Health Care Centers in charge of the screening program, provincial reference lab, and health and treatment network of Isfahan province. Immediate registration of sample data at the time and location of sampling, providing the provincial reference Laboratory and Health Centers of different eparchies with the ability to instantly observe, monitor, and follow-up on the samples at any moment, online verification of samples by reference lab, creating a daily schedule for reference lab, and receiving of the results from analysis equipment; and entering the results into the database without the need for user input are among the features of this software.Conclusion:The implementation of hypothyroidism screening software led to an increase in the quality and efficiency of the screening program; minimized the risk of human error in the process and solved many of the previous limitations of the screening program which were the main goals for implementation of this software. The implementation of this software also resulted in improvement in precision and quality of services provided for these two diseases and better accuracy and precision for data inputs by providing the possibility of entering the sample data at the place and time of sampling which then resulted in the possibility of management based on precise data and also helped develop a comprehensive database and improved the satisfaction of service recipients.Keywords: Hypothyroidism, infants, phenylketonuria, process digitalization, screening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5433631/

Drug responses are highly variable because innumerable factors contribute to ultimate phenotypic outcomes. Recent genome-wide PGx studies have provided some insight into genetic basis of variability in drug response. These can be grouped into three categories. [a] Monogenic (Mendelian) traits include early examples mostly of inherited disorders, and some severe (idiosyncratic) ADRs typically influenced by single rare coding variants. [b] Predominantly oligogenic traits represent variation largely influenced by a small number of major pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic genes. [c] Complex PGx traits resemble most multifactorial quantitative traits –– influenced by numerous small-effect variants, together with epigenetic effects and environmental factors. Prediction of monogenic drug responses is relatively simple, involving detection of underlying mutations; due to rarity of these events and incomplete penetrance, however, prospective tests based on genotype will have high false-positive rates, plus pharmacoeconomics will require justification. Prediction of predominantly oligogenic traits is slowly improving. Although a substantial fraction of variation can be explained by limited numbers of large-effect genetic variants, uncertainty in successful predictions and overall cost-benefit ratios will make such tests elusive for everyday clinical use. Prediction of complex PGx traits is almost impossible in the foreseeable future. Genome-wide association studies of large cohorts will continue to discover relevant genetic variants; however, these small-effect variants, combined, explain only a small fraction of phenotypic variance –– thus having limited predictive power and clinical utility.Keywords: Pharmacogenetics, Pharmacogenomics (PGx), Genetic risk prediction, Monogenic (Mendelian) PGx traits, Predominantly oligogenetic PGx traits, Complex PGx traits, Genetic architecture",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5653378/

Several states have regulations requiring mandatory reporting of a newborn’s hearing status. This is an important public health responsibility of pediatric audiologists. Reasons for failing to report vary.DesignThe Early Hearing Detection and Intervention-Pediatric Audiology Links to Services (EHDI) facility survey was used to inform reporting compliance of audiology facilities throughout the United States. The survey was disseminated via articles, newsletters, and call-to-action notices to audiologists.ResultsAmong 1024 facilities surveyed, 88 (8.6%) reported that they did not report newborn’s hearing findings to their state EHDI program. Not knowing how to report to the state EHDI program was the most frequently chosen reason (60%). However, among the 936 facilities that were compliant with the reporting requirements, 51 estimated that they reported less than two-third of all hearing evaluation results (5.4%). Some facilities did not report a normal-hearing result and some failed to report because they assumed another facility would report the hearing results.ConclusionsSurvey results indicated that audiologists were compliant reporting hearing results to the state EHDI programs.

This study describes the epidemiology of transition in a population of RD patients, using data from the Veneto Region Rare Diseases Registry (VRRDR), a web-based registry monitoring since 2002 a consistent number of RD in a defined area (4.9 million inhabitants). Methods: Longitudinal cohorts of patients born in the years 1988 to 1998 and enrolled in the VRRDR in their paediatric age were identified. Data referred to this group of patients, experiencing transition from paediatric to adult age during the years 2006–2016, are presented. Results: 2153 RD patients (44.1% females and 55.9% males) passed from childhood to adulthood in the study period, corresponding to a 3-fold increase from 2006 to 2016. The majority of these patients was affected by congenital anomalies (32.0%), by hematologic diseases (15.9%), eye disorders (12.1%) and neoplasms (7.9%).

Concomitantly, plasma metabolomic profiling was performed using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify preliminary metabolomic biomarker candidates. Among the 1028 metabolites identified, 34 were significantly increased in subjects with high liver and kidney disease severity compared with those with low liver and kidney disease severity. The highest average fold-change (2.39) was for 4-acetamidobutanoate. Metabolite-based enriched pathways were significantly associated with the identified metabolomic signature (P values ranged from 2.07E-06 to 0.02919). Ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, methylation, and glucuronidation were among the most significant protein-based enriched pathways associated with this metabolomic signature (P values ranged from 1.09E-18 to 7.61E-05).

Newborn bloodspots positive by biochemical testing were analysed by PEARS assay to detect pathogenic mutations relevant to the IEM.ResultsIn initial validation studies of genomic DNA samples, PEARS assay correctly detected 25 known mutations associated with 17 different IEM. Retrospective gene analysis of newborns with clinical phenylketonuria (PKU), identified compound heterozygote phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations in eight of nine samples (89%). Prospective analysis of 211 bloodspots correctly identified the two true PKU samples, yielding positive and negative predictive values of 100%. Testing of 8 true positive MS MS samples correctly identified potentially pathogenic compound heterozygote genotypes in 2 cases of citrullinemia type 1 and one case each of methylmalonic acidemia, isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and glutaric acid type II and heterozygous genotypes in 2 cases of autosomal dominant methioninemia.

In contrast, untreated or late-treated PKU is known to result in severe intellectual disability, seizures, and behavioral disturbances. Rarely, however, untreated or late-diagnosed PKU patients with high plasma phenylalanine concentrations have been reported to escape from intellectual disability. The present study aimed to review published cases of such PKU patients.MethodsTo this purpose, we conducted a literature search in PubMed and EMBASE up to 8th of September 2017 to identify cases with 1) PKU diagnosis and start of treatment after 7 years of age; 2) untreated plasma phenylalanine concentrations ≥1200 μmol/l; and 3) IQ ≥80. Literature search, checking reference lists, selection of articles, and extraction of data were performed by two independent researchers.ResultsIn total, we identified 59 published cases of patients with late-diagnosed PKU and unexpected favorable outcome who met the inclusion criteria. Although all investigated patients had intellectual functioning within the normal range, at least 19 showed other neurological, psychological, and/or behavioral symptoms.ConclusionsBased on the present findings, the classical symptomatology of untreated or late-treated PKU may need to be rewritten, not only in the sense that intellectual dysfunction is not obligatory, but also in the sense that intellectual functioning does not (re)present the full picture of brain damage due to high plasma phenylalanine concentrations.

It also plays a key role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Free radical generation is a common phenomenon that occurs in cells under healthy as well as under stress conditions such as ageing, inflammation, alcohol consumption, and smoking. These free radicals attack the cell membranes and generate highly reactive lipid peroxidation products such as 4-oxononenal (4-ONE). BiP is a key protein that is modified by 4-ONE. In this study, we probed how such chemical modification affects the biophysical properties of BiP. Upon modification, BiP shows significant tertiary structural changes with no changes in its secondary structure. The protein loses its thermodynamic stability, particularly, that of the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) where ATP binds. In terms of function, the modified BiP completely loses its ATPase activity with decreased ATP binding affinity. However, modified BiP retains its immunoglobulin binding function and its chaperone activity of suppressing non-specific protein aggregation. These results indicate that 4-ONE modification can significantly affect the structure-function of key proteins such as BiP involved in cellular pathways, and provide a molecular basis for how chemical modifications can result in the failure of quality control mechanisms inside the cell.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590874/

LNCS are food additives that are broadly used as sugar substitutes to sweeten foods and beverages with the addition of fewer or no calories. They are also used in medicines, health-care products, such as toothpaste, and food supplements. The goal of this Consensus was to provide a useful, evidence-based, point of reference to assist in efforts to reduce free sugars consumption in line with current international public health recommendations. Participating experts in the Lisbon Consensus analysed and evaluated the evidence in relation to the role of LNCS in food safety, their regulation and the nutritional and dietary aspects of their use in foods and beverages. The conclusions of this Consensus were: (1) LNCS are some of the most extensively evaluated dietary constituents, and their safety has been reviewed and confirmed by regulatory bodies globally including the World Health Organisation, the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Food Safety Authority; (2) Consumer education, which is based on the most robust scientific evidence and regulatory processes, on the use of products containing LNCS should be strengthened in a comprehensive and objective way; (3) The use of LNCS in weight reduction programmes that involve replacing caloric sweeteners with LNCS in the context of structured diet plans may favour sustainable weight reduction. Furthermore, their use in diabetes management programmes may contribute to a better glycaemic control in patients, albeit with modest results. LNCS also provide dental health benefits when used in place of free sugars; (4) It is proposed that foods and beverages with LNCS could be included in dietary guidelines as alternative options to products sweetened with free sugars; (5) Continued education of health professionals is required, since they are a key source of information on issues related to food and health for both the general population and patients. With this in mind, the publication of position statements and consensus documents in the academic literature are extremely desirable.Keywords: non-nutritive sweeteners, low-calorie sweeteners, sweeteners, Ibero-American, safety, regulation, obesity, diabetes, cancer, added sugars",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073242/

Genetics and diet exert a strong influence on the microbiome, and diet is used (alone or as an adjuvant) in the treatment of many IEMs. This review will describe how the effects of the microbiome on the host can interfere with IEM phenotypes through interactions with organs such as the liver and brain, two of the structures most commonly affected by IEMs. The relationships between treatment strategies for some IEMs and the microbiome will also be addressed.

We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) for the last 20 years in Cushing’s Syndrome (CS) to illustrate Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) challenges, and show what solutions were found.PROs and other Clinical Outcome Assessment (COA) used with CS patients were reviewed in 36 studies. Two CS-specific Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) measures were identified (i.e., CushingQoL, Tuebingen CD-25), as well as depression and neurocognitive measures. For CS-specific HRQL measures, the CushingQoL was the most widely used measure due in part to being the first CS-specific HRQL measure developed. With algorithms mapping the CushingQoL to both the SF-6D and EQ-5D, the CushingQoL could be used to facilitate economic modelling studies in the absence of a generic HRQL measure. While the CushingQoL offers only the global scale and two subscales compared to the six subscales of the Tuebingen CD-25, there is not yet adequate statistical validation data available for the Tuebingen CD-25 to suggest it can withstand the scrutiny of review by multiple stakeholders. Results of this review indicate that the inclusion of a measure of depressive symptoms, such as the BDI-II or similar measure, would be reasonable to include given the high level of comorbidity of depression among CS patients. A brief neurocognitive performance outcome, such as Trail Making tasks A and D or Digit Symbol, could help inform the interpretation of HRQL results. Neurocognitive differences may be an unassessed mediator of HRQL outcomes, partly accounting for the persistence of depressive symptoms and HRQL deficits despite treatment. Results suggest that HRQL improvements are possible within this population. These results are limited by small sample sizes and pre/post study design.CS showcases the difficulties encountered in measuring PROs in rare diseases. A solution for this specific case was developed in the form of dedicated PRO instruments, the CushingQOL and the Tuebingen-25.

Background and study aims 
Quality of inspection during colonoscopy is strictly related to the level of cleansing. High-volume (PEG-based) solutions are highly effective and safe, but their high volume affects tolerability and compliance. The aim of this study was to compare a new low-volume PEG with citrate and simethicone solution (PMF 104,Clensia) with a low-volume PEG with ascorbic acid solution (PEG-ASC; Moviprep).

Patients and methods
 This was a multicenter, randomized, observer-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 clinical trial, where patients were randomized between PMF 104 and PEG-ASC. In both groups, patients were instructed to take a full-dose regimen the evening before if colonoscopy was scheduled before 11 am to 12 pm, or to take a split regimen if colonoscopy was scheduled after 11 am to 12 pm. The primary end-point was an equivalence between PMF104 and PEG-ASC in the rate of adequate level of cleansing (Ottawa scale ≤ 6), with safety, mucosal visibility, tolerability, acceptance and compliance being also assessed.

Results 
Of the 403 enrolled, 367 patients (Mean age [SD]: 55.6 (14.4) years; male:166 [45.2 %]) were included in the per protocol (PP) analysis: 184 being randomized in the PMF 104 group and 183 in the PEG-ASC group. Successful bowel cleansing was 78.3 % and 74.3 % in PMF104 and in PEG-ASC, respectively (
P
 = 0.37). Both preparations were equally safe (mild adverse events were observed in 9.2 % and 9.3 % of patients in the PMF104 and in the PEG-ASC group, respectively) and acceptable (no or mild distress during the intake in 81.4 % and 80.8 % in the PMF104 in the PEG-ASC, respectively [
P
 = 0.74]).

Conclusion 
The new low-volume product Clensia is equivalent to the reference low-volume PEG-ASC in terms of bowel cleansing, safety and acceptance.

This review focuses on specific alterations of gut microbiota mostly observed in autistic patients. Particularly, the mechanisms through which such alterations may trigger the production of the bacterial metabolites, or leaky gut in autistic people are described. Various altered metabolite levels were observed in the blood and urine of autistic children, many of which were of bacterial origin such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), indoles and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A less integrative gut-blood-barrier is abundant in autistic individuals. This explains the leakage of bacterial metabolites into the patients, triggering new body responses or an altered metabolism. Some other co-occurring symptoms such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress in cells, altered tight junctions in the blood-brain barrier and structural changes in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum were also detected. Moreover, this paper suggests that ASD is associated with an unbalanced gut microbiota (dysbiosis). Although the cause-effect relationship between ASD and gut microbiota is not yet well established, the consumption of specific probiotics may represent a side-effect free tool to re-establish gut homeostasis and promote gut health. The diagnostic and therapeutic value of bacterial-derived compounds as new possible biomarkers, associated with perturbation in the phenylalanine metabolism, as well as potential therapeutic strategies will be discussed.Keywords: Autism, ASD, microbiota, gut-brain-axis, microbiota-gut-brain-axis, probiotics, prebiotics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6539237/

These nutrients include l-carnitine, choline/phosphatidylcholine, tryptophan and tyrosine, which are also sold over-the-counter as nutritional supplements. Physicians and patients alike should be aware that, in CKD patients, the use of these supplements may lead to potentially toxic effects. Unfortunately, most patients with CKD are not aware of their condition. Some of the dietary components may modify the gut microbiota, increasing the number of bacteria that process them to yield uremic toxins, such as trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO), p-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl sulfate and indole-3 acetic acid. Circulating levels of nutrient-derived uremic toxins are associated to increased risk of death and cardiovascular disease and there is evidence that this association may be causal.

We conducted an integrative review of the published relevant scientific evidence to ascertain the factors that may influence these women with their reproductive decisions.

Linear regression modeling was used to estimate the effect of gene-environment interactions on BMI for 131 lifestyle factors related to: dietary habits, smoking and alcohol consumption, physical activity, socioeconomic status, mental health, sleeping patterns, as well as female-specific factors such as menopause and childbirth. In total, 15 lifestyle factors were observed to interact with GSBMI, of which alcohol intake frequency, usual walking pace, and Townsend deprivation index, a measure of socioeconomic status, were all highly significant (p = 1.45*10−29, p = 3.83*10−26, p = 4.66*10−11, respectively).

The aim of the SPARK (Safety Paediatric efficAcy phaRmacokinetic with Kuvan®) trial was to assess the efficacy (improvement in daily phenylalanine tolerance, neuromotor development and growth parameters), safety and pharmacokinetics of sapropterin dihydrochloride in children <4 years.ResultsIn total, 109 male or female children <4 years with confirmed BH4-responsive phenylketonuria or mild hyperphenylalaninemia and good adherence to dietary treatment were screened. 56 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 10 mg/kg/day oral sapropterin plus a phenylalanine-restricted diet or to only a phenylalanine-restricted diet for 26 weeks (27 to the sapropterin and diet group and 29 to the diet-only group; intention-to-treat population). Of these, 52 patients with ≥1 pharmacokinetic sample were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis, and 54 patients were included in the safety analysis. At week 26 in the sapropterin plus diet group, mean phenylalanine tolerance was 30.5 (95% confidence interval 18.7–42.3) mg/kg/day higher than in the diet-only group (p < 0.001). The safety profile of sapropterin, measured monthly, was acceptable and consistent with that seen in studies of older children.

In addition to EHMT1 mutations, de novo variants were reported in four additional genes (MBD5, SMARCB1, NR1I3, and KMT2C), in single individuals with clinical characteristics overlapping Kleefstra syndrome. Here, we present a novel cohort of five patients with de novo loss of function mutations affecting the histone methyltransferase KMT2C. Our clinical data delineates the KMT2C phenotypic spectrum and reinforces the phenotypic overlap with Kleefstra syndrome and other related ID disorders. To elucidate the common molecular basis of the neuropathology associated with mutations in KMT2C and EHMT1, we characterized the role of the Drosophila KMT2C ortholog, trithorax related (trr), in the nervous system. Similar to the Drosophila EHMT1 ortholog, G9a, trr is required in the mushroom body for short term memory. Trr ChIP-seq identified 3371 binding sites, mainly in the promoter of genes involved in neuronal processes. Transcriptional profiling of pan-neuronal trr knockdown and G9a null mutant fly heads identified 613 and 1123 misregulated genes, respectively.

A wide range of different rare conditions has resulted in a myriad of studies investigating the specificities of the diagnosis in focus. The shared psychological experiences of individuals with a rare condition, however, have not been reviewed systematically.MethodsWe performed a systematic review, including qualitative studies on adults, published between 2000 and 2016. Papers including more than one rare genetic or nongenetic diagnosis were included. Studies based on single diagnoses were excluded except for four specific conditions: hemophilia (bleeding disorder), phenylketonuria (metabolic disorder), Fabry disease (lysosomal storage disorder), and epidermolysis bullosa (skin disorder).ResultsThe review identified 21 studies. Findings were synthesized and categorized according to three main themes: (1) Consequences of living with a rare disorder, (2) Social aspects of living with a rare disorder, and (3) Experiences with the health care system. Findings point to several unique challenges, such as the psychological, medical, and social consequences of a lack of knowledge about the condition in health care and social settings.ConclusionThe findings highlight the need for more research on the shared psychological and social impact of living with a rare diagnosis across conditions, in order to identify risk factors and inform clinical practice.Keywords: adult, patient experiences, psychosocial, qualitative research, rare diseases, systematic review",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5702559/

The prevalence of feeding difficulties (FDs) and orofacial myofunctional disorders (OMDs) in these patients is unknown. Objective: To ascertain the prevalence of FDs and OMDs in GSD. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, prospective study of 36 patients (19 males; median age, 12.0 years; range, 8.0–18.7 years) with confirmed diagnoses of GSD (type Ia = 22; Ib = 8; III = 2; IXa = 3; IXc = 1). All patients were being treated by medical geneticists and dietitians. Evaluation included a questionnaire for evaluation of feeding behavior, the orofacial myofunctional evaluation (AMIOFE), olfactory and taste performance (Sniffin’ Sticks and Taste Strips tests), and facial anthropometry. Results: Nine (25%) patients had decreased olfactory perception, and four (11%) had decreased taste perception for all flavours. Eight patients (22.2%) had decreased perception for sour taste. Twenty-six patients (72.2%) had FD, and 18 (50%) had OMD. OMD was significantly associated with FD, tube feeding, selective intake, preference for fluid and semisolid foods, and mealtime stress (p < 0.05). Thirteen patients (36.1%) exhibited mouth or oronasal breathing, which was significantly associated with selective intake (p = 0.011) and not eating together with the rest of the family (p = 0.041). Lower swallowing and chewing scores were associated with FD and with specific issues related to eating behavior (p < 0.05). Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of FDs and OMDs in patients with GSD. Eating behavior, decreased taste and smell perception, and orofacial myofunctional issues are associated with GSD.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this chapter (10.1007/8904_2018_131) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Feeding and eating disorders, Feeding behavior, Glycogen storage disease, Metabolism, inborn errors, Myofunctional therapy, Stomatognathic system",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6336547/

It contained 31 open and multiple-choice questions. The results were analysed according to different geographical regions.ResultsNinety-five centres from 21 countries responded. Over 60% of centres commenced diet in infants by age 10 days, with 58% of centres implementing newborn screening by day 3 post birth. At diagnosis, infant hospital admission occurred in 61% of metabolic centres, mainly in Eastern, Western and Southern Europe. Breastfeeding fell sharply following diagnosis with only 30% of women still breast feeding at 6 months.53% of centres gave pre-measured Phe-free infant formula before each breast feed and 23% alternated breast feeds with Phe-free infant formula. With standard infant formula feeds, measured amounts were followed by Phe-free infant formula to satiety in 37% of centres (n = 35/95), whereas 44% (n = 42/95) advised mixing both formulas together. Weaning commenced between 17 and 26 weeks in 85% centres, ≥26 weeks in 12% and < 17 weeks in 3%.DiscussionThis is the largest European survey completed on PKU infant feeding practices.

However, the market is still dominated by prokaryotic and mammalian expression systems, the former offering high production capacity at a low cost, and the latter favored for the production of complex biopharmaceutical products. Although plant systems are now gaining widespread acceptance as a platform for the larger-scale production of recombinant proteins, there is still resistance to commercial uptake. This partly reflects the relatively low yields achieved in plants, as well as inconsistent product quality and difficulties with larger-scale downstream processing. Furthermore, there are only a few cases in which plants have demonstrated economic advantages compared to established and approved commercial processes, so industry is reluctant to switch to plant-based production. Nevertheless, some plant-derived proteins for research or cosmetic/pharmaceutical applications have reached the market, showing that plants can excel as a competitive production platform in some niche areas. Here, we discuss the strengths of plant expression systems for specific applications, but mainly address the bottlenecks that must be overcome before plants can compete with conventional systems, enabling the future commercial utilization of plants for the production of valuable proteins.Keywords: cell-free biosynthesis, CHO cells, molecular farming, plant-made pharmaceuticals, Pseudomonas fluorescens",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6579924/

The commonly used Cas9 of Streptococcus pyogenes shows high levels of activity but, depending on the application, has been associated with some shortcomings. Firstly, the enzyme has been shown to cause mutagenesis at genomic sequences resembling the target sequence. Secondly, the stringent requirement for a specific motif adjacent to the selected target site can limit the target range of this enzyme. Lastly, the physical size of Cas9 challenges the efficient delivery of genomic engineering tools based on this enzyme as viral particles for potential therapeutic applications. Related and parallel strategies have been employed to address these issues. Taking advantage of the wealth of structural information that is becoming available for CRISPR-Cas effector proteins, Cas9 has been redesigned by mutagenizing key residues contributing to activity and target recognition. The protein has also been shortened and redesigned into component subunits in an attempt to facilitate its efficient delivery. Furthermore, the CRISPR-Cas toolbox has been expanded by exploring the properties of Cas9 orthologues and other related effector proteins from diverse bacterial species, some of which exhibit different target site specificities and reduced molecular size. It is hoped that the improvements in accuracy, target range and efficiency of delivery will facilitate the therapeutic application of these site-specific nucleases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569134/

To improve translational success, one strategy is to select novel targets for which there is proof of clinical relevance, either genetically through heritable traits, or pharmacologically. Such an approach by definition yields targets with high clinical validity. The biology of these targets can be elucidated in animal models before returning to the patients with a refined therapeutic. For optimal treatment, having biomarkers of drug action available is also a plus. Here we describe a case study in rational drug design: the use of controlled inhibition of peripheral tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis to reduce abnormal chronic pain states without altering nociceptive-protective pain. Initially identified in a population of patients with low back pain, the association between BH4 production and chronic pain has been confirmed in more than 12 independent cohorts, through a common haplotype (present in 25% of Caucasians) of the rate-limiting enzyme for BH4 synthesis, GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1). Genetic tools in mice have demonstrated that both injured sensory neurons and activated macrophages engage increased BH4 synthesis to cause chronic pain. GCH1 is an obligate enzyme for de novo BH4 production. Therefore, inhibiting GCH1 activity eliminates all BH4 production, affecting the synthesis of multiple neurotransmitters and signaling molecules and interfering with physiological function. In contrast, targeting the last enzyme of the BH4 synthesis pathway, sepiapterin reductase (SPR), allows reduction of pathological BH4 production without completely blocking physiological BH4 synthesis. Systemic SPR inhibition in mice has not revealed any safety concerns to date, and available genetic and pharmacologic data suggest similar responses in humans. Finally, because it is present in vivo only when SPR is inhibited, sepiapterin serves as a reliable biomarker of target engagement, allowing potential quantification of drug efficacy. The emerging development of therapeutics that target BH4 synthesis to treat chronic pain illustrates the power of combining human and mouse genetics: human genetic studies for clinical selection of relevant targets, coupled with causality studies in mice, allowing the rational engineering of new analgesics.Keywords: Chronic pain, Genetics, Mouse models, Tetrahydrobiopterin, Sepiapterin reductase, Analgesics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5799129/

PAH senses elevated Phe concentrations by transient allosteric Phe binding to a protein–protein interface between ACT domains of different subunits in a PAH tetramer. This interface is present in an activated PAH (A-PAH) tetramer and absent in a resting-state PAH (RS-PAH) tetramer. To investigate this allosteric sensing mechanism, here we used the GROMACS molecular dynamics simulation suite on the Folding@home computing platform to perform extensive molecular simulations and Markov state model (MSM) analysis of Phe binding to ACT domain dimers. These simulations strongly implicated a conformational selection mechanism for Phe association with ACT domain dimers and revealed protein motions that act as a gating mechanism for Phe binding. The MSMs also illuminate a highly mobile hairpin loop, consistent with experimental findings also presented here that the PAH variant L72W does not shift the PAH structural equilibrium toward the activated state. Finally, simulations of ACT domain monomers are presented, in which spontaneous transitions between resting-state and activated conformations are observed, also consistent with a mechanism of conformational selection. These mechanistic details provide detailed insight into the regulation of PAH activation and provide testable hypotheses for the development of new allosteric effectors to correct structural and functional defects in PAH.Keywords: molecular dynamics, ligand-binding protein, kinetics, allosteric regulation, conformational change, binding pathways, ligand binding kinetics, Markov state models, phenylketonuria, phenylalanine hydroxylase, molecular simulation, conformational selection",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6314134/

They involve great complexity of the underlying pathophysiology, biochemical workup, and molecular analysis, and have complicated therapeutic options for management. Age of presentation can vary from infancy to adolescence with the more severe forms appearing in early childhood accompanied by significant morbidity and mortality. The understanding of these complex disorders requires special in-depth training, American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ABMGG) certification and experience. Most primary care physicians (PCPs) are reluctant to deal with IEM due to unfamiliarity and rarity of such conditions compounded by prompt progression to crisis situations along with paucity of time involved in dealing with such complex disorders.

MWI was performed on a 3.0T whole body magnetic resonance scanner. Myelin water fraction (MWF) was extracted for the dorsal columns and whole cord. SSEPs and MWF were also compared with conventional MRI outcomes, including T2 signal intensity, compression ratio, maximum spinal cord compression (MSCC), and maximum canal compromise (MCC).Results: Group analysis showed marked differences in T2 signal intensity, compression ratio, MSCC, and MCC between healthy controls and patients with CSM.

MWF was also correlated with SSEP latencies.Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence of decreased myelin content in the spinal cord associated with impaired spinal cord conduction in patients with CSM.

Due to many obstacles, PAH enzyme replacement therapy is not currently an option. Treatment of PKU with an alternative enzyme, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), was first proposed in the 1970s. However, issues regarding immunogenicity, enzyme production and mode of delivery needed to be overcome. Through the evaluation of PAL enzymes from multiple species, three potential PAL enzymes from yeast and cyanobacteria were chosen for evaluation of their therapeutic potential. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW = 20,000), at a particular ratio to modify the protein surface, attenuated immunogenicity in an animal model of PKU. All three PEGylated PAL candidates showed efficacy in a mouse model of PKU (BTBR Pahenu2) upon subcutaneous injection. However, only PEGylated Anabaena variabilis (Av) PAL-treated mice demonstrated sustained low Phe levels with weekly injection and was the only PAL evaluated that maintained full enzymatic activity upon PEGylation. A PEGylated recombinant double mutant version of AvPAL (Cys503Ser/Cys565Ser), rAvPAL-PEG, was selected for drug development based on its positive pharmacodynamic profile and favorable expression titers. PEGylation was shown to be critical for rAvPAL-PEG efficacy as under PEGylated rAvPAL had a lower pharmacodynamic effect. rAvPAL and rAvPAL-PEG had poor stability at 4°C.

The aim of this work is to evaluate the status of Hcys formation methylation cycle and ADMA and SDMA levels in patients with PKU in order to establish a potential relationship.Forty-two early diagnosed PKU patients under dietary treatment and good adherence to their diets were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Their nutritional and biochemical profile, as well as Hcys synthesis status, ADMA and SDMA levels were analyzed and compared with a control group of 40 healthy volunteers. ADMA and SDMA were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography system coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.In this study, 23 classic PKU, 16 moderate PKU, and 3 mild HPA were enrolled.

Several nutrition biomarkers, such as prealbumin, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, selenium, and zinc, were below the normal range.Our study suggests that patients with PKU suffer from poor methylation capacity. Restriction of natural proteins in addition to high intake of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation in the dietary products, produce an impairment of methylation cycle that leads to low Hcys and ADMA levels. As a result, methylated compounds compete for methyl groups, and there is an impairment of methylation cycle due to low Hcys levels, which is related to the lack of protein quality, despite of elevated concentrations of cofactors.Keywords: asymmetric dimethylarginine, creatine, homocysteine, methylation cycle, phenylketonuria",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5502164/

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with abnormalities in dopamine neurotransmission and deficits in reward processing and its underlying neuro-circuitry including the ventral striatum. The microbiome might contribute to ADHD etiology via the gut-brain axis. In this pilot study, we investigated potential differences in the microbiome between ADHD cases and undiagnosed controls, as well as its relation to neural reward processing.MethodsWe used 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing (16S) to identify bacterial taxa and their predicted gene functions in 19 ADHD and 77 control participants. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we interrogated the effect of observed microbiome differences in neural reward responses in a subset of 28 participants, independent of diagnosis.ResultsFor the first time, we describe gut microbial makeup of adolescents and adults diagnosed with ADHD. We found that the relative abundance of several bacterial taxa differed between cases and controls, albeit marginally significant. A nominal increase in the Bifidobacterium genus was observed in ADHD cases. In a hypothesis-driven approach, we found that the observed increase was linked to significantly enhanced 16S-based predicted bacterial gene functionality encoding cyclohexadienyl dehydratase in cases relative to controls. This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of phenylalanine, a precursor of dopamine. Increased relative abundance of this functionality was significantly associated with decreased ventral striatal fMRI responses during reward anticipation, independent of ADHD diagnosis and age.ConclusionsOur results show increases in gut microbiome predicted function of dopamine precursor synthesis between ADHD cases and controls.

Many patients report social isolation and decreased quality of life. Pegvaliase is an enzyme substitution therapy that reduces blood Phe levels in patients with PKU and is associated with a risk of hypersensitivity reactions.ObjectiveTo define the minimum acceptable benefit (MAB) of pegvaliase, i.e., the minimum probability of achieving a blood Phe level <360 μmol/L, which patients require to tolerate the risks of hypersensitivity associated with pegvaliase.MethodsAdult, pegvaliase-naïve patients with blood Phe levels >600 μmol/L participated in a patient-preference web survey using two surveys: adapted swing-weighting and thresholding. Participants were asked to make ordinal choices between varying clinical benefit and severity levels for hypersensitivity. Disease effects and treatment satisfaction were also assessed.ResultsAmong 45 participants, the mean (standard deviation) self-reported blood Phe level was 976.9 (429.9) μmol/L; only 28.8% reported satisfaction with their current treatment. Most (84.4%) indicated difficulty in following a PKU diet; 60% reported that the PKU diet was burdensome, and 58% reported feeling socially isolated. Most (≥69%) reported their MAB to be less than the expected clinical benefit provided by pegvaliase; the mean MAB was 22.7% and 34.4% in the swing-weighting and thresholding surveys, respectively.ConclusionMost participants felt the burden of PKU on their daily lives, were dissatisfied with current treatments, and were willing to accept the risks of hypersensitivity reactions to achieve recommended blood Phe levels with pegvaliase treatment.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, PKU, Pegvaliase, Minimum acceptable benefit, Benefit-risk analysis, Patient preferenceAbbreviations: ANOVA, analysis of variance; FDA, Food and Drug Administration; IgE, immunoglobin E; MAB, minimum acceptable benefit; Phe, phenylalanine; PKU, phenylketonuria; SD, standard deviation; SE, standard error",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6722251/

Recently, more attention has been given to the use of Se supplementation as a new treatment for thyroid disorders. Oxidative stress increases in different thyroid disorders and causes many pathological outcomes. The present study aimed to determine the serum prooxidant-anti - oxidant balance (PAB), Se, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) concentration in congenital hypothyroidism (CH) patients and the association of their probable change with hematological indices.MethodsBlood samples were collected from 60 healthy and 39 CH subjects. Serum PAB values were measured and Se, TSH, FT4 and hematological indices were determined. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 16 and p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsSerum TSH concentration was significantly higher in CH patients group compared to the controls (p value < 0.05); however, FT4 was in the same concentration in patients and controls.

Currently, liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment for these patients and new therapies aiming to treat ALF include artificial organs implant and stem cells therapy, for example. However, a major limitation of liver donors exists. Living donor liver transplantation (LDL﻿T), split liver transplantation (SLT), and domino liver transplantation (DLT) are some of the available alternatives to treat ALF patients, but these do not reduce the number of patients on waiting lists. Herein, we discuss domino hepatocyte transplantation (DHT) using livers that would not meet transplantation criteria. Methods We conducted a literature search on PubMed/Medline using acute liver failure, liver transplantation, hepatocyte transplantation, and domino liver transplantation as key words. Results New sources of biochemically functional hepatocytes and therapeutic treatments, in parallel to organ transplantation, may improve liver injury recovery and decrease mortality rates. Moreover, the literature reports hepatocyte transplantation as a therapeutic alternative for organ shortage. However, a major challenge remains for a wide clinical application of hepatocytes therapy, i.e., the availability of sufficient amounts of cells for transplantation. Ideally, hepatocytes isolated from livers rejected for transplantation may be a promising alternative for this problem.

Methods A cross-sectional study of 277 healthy children from birth to 12 years was conducted. Anthropometric, clinical, and dietary information were recorded. Dried blood spots on a filtered paper were used for measurement by derivatized LC-MS/MS. Factors that might affect amino acids such as fasting time and dietary intake were analyzed using quantile regression analysis. Results Levels of thirteen blood amino acids were reported as median and interval from 2.5th–97.5th percentiles. Compared with those of Caucasian, most blood amino acid levels of Thai children were higher. Compared with a previous study using HPLC in Thai children, many amino acid levels are different. Glycine, alanine, leucine/isoleucine, and glutamic acid sharply decreased after birth. Citrulline, arginine, and methionine stayed low from birth throughout childhood, whereas phenylalanine was at middle level and slightly increased during preadolescence.

Growing evidence suggests that wheel running simulates exercise effects in many mouse models of human conditions, but this activity also might change other aspects of mouse behavior. In this case study, we show that the presence of running wheels leads to pronounced and permanent circling behavior with route-tracing in a proportion of the male mice of a genetically distinct cohort. The genetic background of this cohort includes a mutation in Arhgap19, but genetic crosses showed that an unknown second-site mutation likely caused the induced circling behavior. Behavioral tests for inner-ear function indicated a normal sense of gravity in the circling mice. However, the levels of dopamine, serotonin, and some dopamine metabolites were lower in the brains of circling male mice than in mice of the same genetic background that were weaned without wheels. Circling was seen in both singly and socially housed male mice. The additional stress of fighting may have exacerbated the predisposition to circling in the socially housed animals. Singly and socially housed male mice without wheels did not circle. Our current findings highlight the importance and possibly confounding nature of the environmental and genetic background in mouse behavioral studies, given that the circling behavior and alterations in dopamine and serotonin levels in this mouse cohort occurred only when the male mice were housed with running wheels.Abbreviation: DOPAC, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5361047/

The large sizes of these genes and the absence of mutation hot spots have complicated mutational analysis by routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches. Here, in order to design a rapid and effective method for the genetic diagnosis of AS, we developed a strategy by utilizing targeted capture associated with next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 simultaneously in 20 AS patients. All the coding exons and flanking sequences of COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 from the probands were captured followed by HiSeq 2500 sequencing. Candidate mutations were validated by classic Sanger sequencing and quantitative (q)PCR. Sixteen patients (16/20, 75%) showed X-linked inheritance, and four patients (4/20, 20%) showed autosomal recessive inheritance. None of the individuals had autosomal-dominant AS. Fifteen novel mutations, 6 known mutations, and 2 novel fragment deletions were detected by targeted capture and NGS. Of these novel mutations, 12, 3, and 2 mutations were detected in COL4A5, COL4A4, and COL4A3, respectively.

A sipping device (sipometer) was developed that permits access to a liquid food or beverage on two reward schedules: continuous reinforcement (CR) and progressively increasing time spent exerting pressure on a straw (PR-schedule). In addition, a pictorial scale showing a cup, from which the ‘amount wanted’ could be marked was used to pre-test potential consumption. Intake, time spent sipping, breakpoint, and pressure exerted were the main dependent variables measured. Three pilot experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, participants (n = 8) consumed yogurt shakes after a 1-h or 21-h food deprivation period on both schedules. In Experiment 2, participants (n = 8) sham-consumed (i.e. spit out) sweet and non-sweet beverages, utilizing both schedules. In Experiment 3, sham-consuming sweet and non-sweet beverages on both schedules and working for shake on the PR schedule were repeated, after three nights of either habitual sleep or short sleep duration (n = 7) in a crossover design. In Experiment 1, participants sipped longer after 21-h vs. 1-h of food deprivation (13 ± 3.0 vs. 8.0 ± 2.1 s; p = 0.04), on the PR schedule. In Experiment 2, sham-intake (p = 0.01) and sipping time (p = 0.04) were greater for sweet than non-sweet beverages on the PR schedule and a similar, though not conventionally significant, effect was observed for exerted pressure (p = 0.09). In both Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 after habitual sleep, on the PR schedule, cumulative pressure difference between sweet and non-sweet beverage increased with difference in amount wanted in the taste test. In contrast, after short sleep participants were less willing to work for sweet taste as their wanting increased, suggesting that sleep deprivation raises desire, but lowers behavioral output. Taken together these results demonstrate that the sipometer and associated ratings are reliable and useful measures of motivation to consume and reward value in humans.

Autism onset can be connected with various factors such as metabolic disorders: including carnitine deficiency. Carnitine is a derivative of two amino acid lysine and methionine. Carnitine is a cofactor for a large family of enzymes: the carnitine acyltransferases.

These maladies are associated with the formation of aggregative amyloid protein structures showing common characteristics, such as the assembly of soluble oligomeric species, binding of indicative dyes, and apoptotic cytotoxicity. The canonical yeast models have recently been expanded by the establishment of a model for type II diabetes, a non-neurological amyloid-associated disease. While these model systems require the exogenous expression of mammalian proteins in yeast, an additional amyloid-associated disease model, comprising solely mutations of endogenous yeast genes, has been recently described. Mutated in the adenine salvage pathway, this yeast model exhibits adenine accumulation, thereby recapitulating adenine inborn error of metabolism disorders. Moreover, in line with the recent extension of the amyloid hypothesis to include metabolite amyloids, in addition to protein-associated ones, the intracellular assembly of adenine amyloid-like structures has been demonstrated using this yeast model. In this review, we describe currently available yeast models of diverse amyloid-associated disorders, as well as their impact on our understanding of disease mechanisms and contribution to future potential drug development.Keywords: yeast models, amyloid fibrils, metabolite amyloids, proteinopathy, neurodegenerative diseases, metaboliteopathy, inborn error of metabolism disorders, adenine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6439353/

However, the fundamental mechanism behind the origin of such diverse health problems, particularly the issue of how they are related to the build-up of phenylalanine molecules in the body, is largely unknown. Here, we show cross-seeding ability of phenylalanine fibrils that can effectively initiate an aggregation process in proteins under physiological conditions, converting native protein structures to β-sheet assembly. The resultant fibrils were found to cause severe hemolysis, yielding a plethora of deformed erythrocytes that is highly relevant to phenylketonuria. Unique arrangement of zwitterionic phenylalanine molecules in their amyloid-like higher order entities is predicted to promote both hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction, sufficient enough to trap proteins and to preferentially interact with the membrane components of RBCs. Since the prevalence of hemolysis and amyloid related psychoneurological severities are mostly observed in PKU patients, we propose that the inherent property of phenylalanine fibrils to trigger hemolysis and to induce protein aggregation may have direct relevance to the disease mechanism of PKU.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5593866/

today. The maternal nutritional status could be a determinant of oocyte quality and embryonic growth. This study was
conducted to assess the relationship between dietary patterns and reproductive outcomes in infertile women.Materials and MethodsThis prospective cohort study was conducted on 140 women with primary infertility who
had referred to Isfahan Fertility and Infertility center, Isfahan, Iran. The average number of total oocytes and metaphase
II oocytes, the fertilization rate, the ratio of good and bad quality embryo and biochemical and clinical pregnancy were
considered as the outcomes of assisted reproductive techniques (ART). A 168-item food frequency questionnaire was
used for estimating the dietary intakes during the last year. Factor analysis was used for identifying the dietary patterns
and analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), chi-square, and logistic regression analysis
were used for assessing the relation between dietary patterns and ART’s outcomes.ResultsThree major dietary patterns (the healthy, western and unhealthy diet) were identified. Women with high
adherence to the “healthy diet” had a higher educational level and were employed. There was a significant increase
in the average number of total oocytes (P-trend=0.009) and metaphase II oocytes (P-trend=0.006) in the third tertile
of “healthy diet” compared to the first tertile. Also, women with high adherence to the second tertile of “unhealthy”
diet compared to the first tertile, had a significantly lower chance of getting pregnant [odds ratio (OR): 0.14, 95%
confidence interval (CI): 0.3-0.7].ConclusionNutrition status could affect infertility treatment outcomes. Greater adherence to the healthy diet may
enhance oocyte quality and quantity. Unhealthy diet could adversely affect the chance of getting pregnant.Keywords: Assisted Reproductive Technique, In vitro Fertilization, Infertility, Nutrition",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186288/

Generation of cardiomyoctyes derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has opened new avenues for investigation of human cardiac development. Here we report that uric acid (UA), a physiologically abundant compound during embryonic development, can consistently and robustly enhance cardiac differentiation of human PSCs including hESCs and hiPSCs, in replacement of ascorbic acid (AA). We optimized treatment conditions and demonstrate that differentiation day 0–2, a period for specification of mesoderm cells, was a critical time for UA effects. This was further confirmed by UA-induced upregulation of mesodermal markers. Furthermore, we show that the developing mesoderm may be by directly promoted by SNAI pathway-mediated epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) at 0–24 h and a lengthened G0/G1 phase by increasing the ubiquitination degradation in 24–48 h.

The knowledge of Phe intercalation parameters can be instrumental in understanding various membrane processes triggered by interactions with Phe, in particular the early events leading to the formation of nucleation/docking sites for the self-assembly of Phe amyloid fibrils at the membrane surface.ResultsIn this study, we used monolayers of phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) and phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) to mimic the membrane outer leaflet. Its initial interaction with Phe was modeled by injecting Phe into the aqueous phase underneath the monolayer. Constant pressure insertion assays augmented with epifluorescence microscopy imaging were used to monitor Phe intercalation. Our primary goal was to determine the Phe intercalation area, APhe. Two values were obtained for APhe, 33 ± 2 and 48 ± 3 Å2.ConclusionsPhe appeared to discriminate between DPPE and DPPC packing, and use two modes of intercalation. The area of APhe 33 ± 2 Å2 is consistent with a Phe monomer intercalating into membrane by inserting the phenyl ring nearly normal to the membrane surface. This mode has been found to operate in DPPE membranes. For DPPC membranes however, the value of APhe = 48 ± 3 Å2 suggests that, from saline, Phe tends to intercalate as a larger species plausibly dragging along a counterion, Na+, in a Na+(Phe) complex.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13628-018-0047-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylalanine, Langmuir monolayer, Epifluorescence microscopy, Amino acid/phospholipid interaction, Amyloid fibrils",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6237005/

Integration of VAMS with mass spectrometry (MS)-based untargeted metabolomics is an attractive solution for both human and animal studies. However, to boost the use of VAMS in metabolomics, key pre-analytical questions need to be addressed. Therefore, in this work, we integrated VAMS in a MS-based untargeted metabolomics workflow and investigated pre-analytical strategies such as sample extraction procedures and metabolome stability at different storage conditions. We first evaluated the best extraction procedure for the polar metabolome and found that the highest number and amount of metabolites were recovered upon extraction with acetonitrile/water (70:30). In contrast, basic conditions (pH 9) resulted in divergent metabolite profiles mainly resulting from the extraction of intracellular metabolites originating from red blood cells. In addition, the prolonged storage of blood samples at room temperature caused significant changes in metabolome composition, but once the VAMS devices were stored at − 80 °C, the metabolome remained stable for up to 6 months. The time used for drying the sample did also affect the metabolome. In fact, some metabolites were rapidly degraded or accumulated in the sample during the first 48 h at room temperature, indicating that a longer drying step will significantly change the concentration in the sample.Keywords: Metabolomics, Volumetric absorptive microsampling, Mass spectrometry",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5694668/

In this direction, it was reported that surface hydration is important for the binding affinity of the amino acid which significantly perturbs 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) monolayer structure and morphology. A deeper insight showed that Phe inserts in DPPC monolayer defects as a monomer at pH 5 and forms aggregates that adsorb to the membrane surface generating a reconfiguration of the lipid arrangement in areas of higher packing. This new arrangement in the monolayer causes the reorientation of dipoles of lipid and water molecules which is congruent with the dehydration and surface tension changes reported above. With this background, this article studies the affinity of Phe in liquid-expanded 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphocholine (LE DMPC) and liquid-condensed 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (LC DPPC) monolayers and their effects on membrane properties.Results:The adsorption of Phe can be described by a cooperative process in non-independent sites suggesting that Phe/lipid systems reorganize to form new structures at a high degree of coverage. Compressibility modulus and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) images allow to propose that Phe causes a new phase in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphocholine (DMPC) and DPPC.Conclusions:Phe imposes new arrangements in the lipid phase to form new structures with different compressibility behavior than lipid binary mixtures of DMPC and DPPC. Phe interaction with the LC and LE phases gives place to a process in which a synergistic effect between non-independent sites can be produced. These features of Phe/lipid interaction would be of great importance to understand the multiple effects of Phe on cell membranes.Keywords: DMPC, DPPC, monolayers, phenylalanine, compressibility, domains",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6322106/

Hyperhomocysteinemia also showed that it might be involved in pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric disorders. The late-onset clinical manifestations of these 2 diseases have not been reported elsewhere. We speculated that the late-onset PKU is caused by 2 kinds of metabolic dysfunction synergistically, especially a short period of irregular diet directly caused clinical symptoms.Patient concerns:A 21-year old Asian male patient demonstrated subacute leukodystrophy and visual-spatial disorders of late onset in adulthood.Diagnoses:Phenylketonuria combined with homocysteinmia, who presented with heterozygous mutations in gene encoding PAH p.G247R (c.739G>C) and p.Y204C (c.611A>G), along with homozygous mutation of gene encoding MTHFR c.677C>T.Interventions:The patient was treated with cobalamine (500 μg/day), vitamin B6 (30 mg/day), folate (5 mg/day) and encouraged to follow a protein-restricted diet.Outcomes:Visual disorientation and cognitive function showed improvement. Head MR showed similar resolution with the original lesion. Serum homocysteine and folate analysis were normal with decreased phenylalanine level.Lessons:This case suggests that neurological involvement of progressive nervous system dysfunction could be caused by more than one kind of inherited metabolic disturbances, and each one can induce or deteriorate the manifestations of another metabolic disorders.Keywords: leukoencephalopathy, phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylketonuria",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842012/

Environment and food (quality and quantity) are the key factors known to affect the health of an individual. The fundamental concepts are that the transition from a healthy condition to a disease phenotype must occur by concurrent alterations in the genome expression or by differences in protein synthesis, function and metabolites. In other words, the dietary components directly or indirectly modulate the molecular fingerprint and understanding of which is dealt with nutrigenomics. Although the fundamental principles of nutrigenomics remain similar to that of traditional research, a collection of comprehensive targeted/untargeted data sets in the context of nutrition offers the unique advantage of understanding complex metabolic networks to provide a mechanistic understanding of data from epidemiological and intervention studies. In this review the challenges and opportunities of nutrigenomic tools in addressing the nutritional problems of public health importance are discussed. The application of nutrigenomic tools provided numerous leads on biomarkers of nutrient intake, undernutrition, metabolic syndrome and its complications. Importantly, nutrigenomic studies also led to the discovery of the association of multiple genetic polymorphisms in relation to the variability of micronutrient absorption and metabolism, providing a potential opportunity for further research toward setting personalized dietary recommendations for individuals and population subgroups.Keywords: Biomarkers, micronutrients, molecular fingerprint, nutrigenomics, recommended dietary allowances, stunting",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6366269/

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the microstructural integrity of WM pathways across the whole brain in a cohort of paediatric ETPKU patients compared with healthy controls (HCs), by collecting DTI-MRI (diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging) data and diffusion values (mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and fractional anisotropy (FA)).MethodsDTI-MRI data and diffusion values (MD, RD, FA) from WM tracts across the whole brain were analized using Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), in 15 paediatrics TPKU patients (median age: 12 years) and compared with 11 HCs. Areas showing abnormal values in the patient group were correlated (Pearson) with age, lifetime Phe values, last year median and mean Phe, concurrent Phe values in plasma, urine neurotransmitters status biomarkers, and with a processing speed task.ResultsETPKU showed bilaterally decreased MD values compared with HCs in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, corona radiata and in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. RD values followed a similar pattern, although decreased RD values in PKU patients were also found in the anterior limb of the internal capsule and in the cerebral peduncle. Decreased MD and RD values within the aforementioned regions had significant negative correlations with age, last year median and mean Phe and concurrent Phe values. No correlations were found with monoamines in urine or processing speed task.ConclusionsETPKU patients showed MD and RD values significantly decreased across the whole brain when compared with HCs, and this damage was associated with high Phe values and the age of patients. Despite this microstructural damage, no affectation in processing speed was observed in patients with good metabolic control. DTI-MRI sequences could be used as a technique to quantify WM damage that is difficult to be detect in T1 or T2-weighted images, but also to quantify damage of WM through the follow up of patients with poor metabolic control in prospective studies.Keywords: Neuroimaging, Phenylketonuria, Paediatric, Early treatment, Diffusion tensor imaging, Urine monoamines",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6203973/

The epicutaneous application of a hapten, such as 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), evokes an experimental murine AD-like reaction. Glycomacropeptide (GMP) is a dairy bioactive peptide derived from hydrolysis of κ-casein by chymosin action. It has anti-inflammatory, prebiotic, and immunomodulatory effects. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of GMP administration on DNCB-induced AD in rats. The severity of inflammatory process, pruritus, production of cytokines, and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) content were measured, and the histopathological features were analyzed. GMP reduced the intensity of inflammatory process and edema of DNCB-induced dermatitis, with a significant decrease in eosinophils recruitment and mast cells hyperplasia. In addition GMP suppressed the serum levels of total IgE and IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 expression in AD-lesions. Besides, the levels of IL-10 were significantly increased. Remarkably, GMP administration before AD-induction abolished pruritus in dermatitis-like reactions in the rats. Taken together, these results indicate that GMP has an inhibitory effect on AD by downregulating Th2 dominant immune response, suggesting GMP as a potential effective alternative therapy for the prevention and management of AD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5318634/

207,10.1172/jci.insight.121762,30046012,"Go to:AbstractThe neuropathological effects of phenylketonuria (PKU) stem from the inability of the body to metabolize excess phenylalanine (Phe), resulting in accumulation of Phe in the blood and brain. Since the kidney normally reabsorbs circulating amino acids with high efficiency, we hypothesized that preventing the renal uptake of Phe might provide a disposal pathway that could lower systemic Phe levels. SLC6A19 is a neutral amino acid transporter responsible for absorption of the majority of free Phe in the small intestine and reuptake of Phe by renal proximal tubule cells. Transgenic KO mice lacking SLC6A19 have elevated levels of Phe and other amino acids in their urine but are otherwise healthy. Here, we crossed the Pahenu2 mouse model of PKU with the Slc6a19-KO mouse. These mutant/KO mice exhibited abundant excretion of Phe in the urine and an approximately 70% decrease in plasma Phe levels. Importantly, brain Phe levels were decreased by 50%, and the levels of key neurotransmitters were increased in the mutant/KO mice. In addition, a deficit in spatial working memory and markers of neuropathology were corrected. Finally, treatment of Pahenu2 mice with Slc6a19 antisense oligonucleotides lowered Phe levels. The results suggest that inhibition of SLC6A19 may represent a novel approach for the treatment of PKU and related aminoacidopathies.Keywords: Metabolism, TherapeuticsKeywords: Amino acid metabolism, Genetic diseases",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124451/

Recently we showed that 2 h of LAN impaired glucose tolerance in rats. Several studies have suggested that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in communicating these acute effects of LAN to the periphery. Here, we investigated the acute effects of LAN on the liver transcriptome of male Wistar rats. Expression levels of individual genes were not markedly affected by LAN, nevertheless pathway analysis revealed clustered changes in a number of endocrine pathways. Subsequently, we used selective hepatic denervations [sympathetic (Sx), parasympathetic (Px), total (Tx, i.e., Sx plus Px), sham] to investigate the involvement of the ANS in the effects observed. Surgical removal of the sympathetic or parasympathetic hepatic branches of the ANS resulted in many, but small changes in the liver transcriptome, including a pathway involved with circadian clock regulation, but it clearly separated the four denervation groups. On the other hand, analysis of the liver metabolome was not able to separate the denervation groups, and only 6 out of 78 metabolites were significantly up- or downregulated after denervations. Finally, removal of the sympathetic and parasympathetic hepatic nerves combined with LAN exposure clearly modulated the effects of LAN on the liver transcriptome, but left most endocrine pathways unaffected.Conclusion: One-hour light-at-night acutely affects the liver transcriptome. Part of this effect is mediated via the nervous innervation, as a hepatectomy modulated and reduced the effect of LAN on liver transcripts.Keywords: transcriptome, metabolome, biological clock, neural pathway, circadian",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6596368/

The constellation approach was used to categorise barriers and needs into three levels: culture, structure and practice.ResultsBarriers on a cultural level include: undecidedness about the desirability of carrier screening, and a lack of priority of screening in mainstream healthcare. On a structural level barriers included: need for organisational structures in healthcare for embedding carrier screening, need for guidelines, financial structures, practical tools for overcoming challenges during counselling, and a need for training and education of both professionals and the public. A lack of demand for screening by the public, and a need for a division of responsibilities were barriers on a practical level.ConclusionThe absence of a collective sense of urgency for genetic carrier screening, a lack of organisational structures, and uncertainty or even disagreement about the responsibilities seem to be important barriers in the implementation of carrier screening.

SMC is an attractive approach allowing multiple parties to collectively carry out calculations on their datasets without having to reveal their own raw data; however, it incurs heavy computation time and requires extensive communication between the involved parties.ObjectiveThis study aimed to develop usable and efficient SMC applications that meet the needs of the potential end-users and to raise general awareness about SMC as a tool that supports data sharing.MethodsWe have introduced distributed statistical computing (DSC) into the design of secure multiparty protocols, which allows us to conduct computations on each of the parties’ sites independently and then combine these computations to form 1 estimator for the collective dataset, thus limiting communication to the final step and reducing complexity. The effectiveness of our privacy-preserving model is demonstrated through a linear regression application.ResultsOur secure linear regression algorithm was tested for accuracy and performance using real and synthetic datasets. The results showed no loss of accuracy (over nonsecure regression) and very good performance (20 min for 100 million records).ConclusionsWe used DSC to securely calculate a linear regression model over multiple datasets. Our experiments showed very good performance (in terms of the number of records it can handle). We plan to extend our method to other estimators such as logistic regression.Keywords: data analytics, data aggregation, personal genetic information, patient data privacy",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6658266/

Patients’ office visits with their PCPs were audio-recorded, and summative content analysis was used to describe how PCPs discussed genomic results.Key ResultsFor each genomic result discussed in 48 PCP–patient visits, we identified a “take-home” message (recommendation), categorized as continuing current management, further treatment, further evaluation, behavior change, remembering for future care, or sharing with family members. We analyzed how PCPs came to each recommendation by identifying 1) how they described the risk or importance of the given result and 2) the rationale they gave for translating that risk into a specific recommendation. Quantitative analysis showed that continuing current management was the most commonly coded recommendation across results overall (492/749, 66%) and for each individual result type except monogenic disease risk results. Pharmacogenetics was the most common result type to prompt a recommendation to remember for future care (94/119, 79%); carrier status was the most common type prompting a recommendation to share with family members (45/54, 83%); and polygenic results were the most common type prompting a behavior change recommendation (55/58, 95%). One-fifth of recommendation codes associated with monogenic results were for further evaluation (6/24, 25%). Rationales for these recommendations included patient context, family context, and scientific/clinical limitations of sequencing.ConclusionsPCPs distinguish substantive differences among categories of genome sequencing results and use clinical judgment to justify continuing current management in generally healthy patients with genomic results.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s11606-017-4295-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.KEY WORDS: genome sequencing, physician communication, medical decision-making",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5975138/

The rat model was established by administering hypoxanthine through oral gavage and potassium oxonate through intraperitoneal injection. Rats were divided into the normal group, model group, CTG group, and allopurinol group. Serum uric acid, creatinine, urea nitrogen, and inflammatory cytokine levels were determined in each group. In the model group, ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the metabolic profiles and delineate the action mechanism of CTG; in addition, the orthogonal projection method was used to perform latent structure-discrimination analysis to screen the related metabolites. The results indicated significant differences in the metabolic profiles between the model and normal groups. A total of seven related metabolites were identified through screening in the model group, mainly related to the pathways of bile secretion, pyrimidine, purine, and phenylalanine metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and pentose and glucuronate interconversions; these related pathways were reversed in the CTG group. In the metabolic networks, uracil and acetyl-coenzyme A were the nodal molecules. In addition, the test results of the evaluation of serum biochemical and inflammatory factors confirmed that CTG had significant effect in reducing the levels of serum uric acid and protecting renal function. These results confirmed that CTG primarily regulated the recruitment of nodal molecules to achieve anti-inflammatory effects, reduced uric acid level, and renal protection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6206513/

Preconception expanded carrier screening, according to the World Health Organization’s definition, is a novel health technology and therefore warrants assessment, part of which involves evaluating ethical and social implications. We examined ten Swedish policymakers’ perspectives on ethical and social aspects of preconception expanded screening through in-depth expert interviewing, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Respondents were affiliated to governmental and non-governmental institutions that directly influence healthcare policymaking in Sweden. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed via inductive thematic analysis method, which generated seven themes and several subthemes. Policymakers harbored concerns regarding the economics, Swedish and international political respects, implementation procedures, and societal effects, which included long-term ones. Moreover, participants detailed the role of public engagement, research, and responsibility in regard to preconception expanded carrier screening implementation. Since this is a qualitative study, with a small non-random sample, the results may not be generalizable to all policymakers in Sweden. However, the results give a profound insight into the process and interpretative knowledge of experts, in the Swedish milieu and the extent of readiness of Sweden to implement a preconception expanded carrier screening program.Keywords: Preconception, Expanded carrier screening, Genetic, Policymakers, Reproductive decision-making, Ethics, Social effects",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6435768/

Dietary restriction of phenylalanine is considered to be the main treatment of PKU to prevent irreversible intellectual disability. However, the same dietary intervention in BH4 deficiency patients is not as effective, as BH4 is also a cofactor in many neurotransmitter syntheses.MethodWe utilized next generation sequencing (NGS) technique to investigate four unrelated Thai patients with hyperphenylalaninemia.ResultWe successfully identified all eight mutant alleles in PKU or BH4-deficiency associated genes including three novel mutations, one in PAH and two in PTS, thus giving a definite diagnosis to these patients. Appropriate management can then be provided.ConclusionThis study identified three novel mutations in either the PAH or PTS gene and supported the use of NGS as an alternative molecular genetic approach for definite diagnosis of hyperphenylalaninemia, thus leading to proper management of these patients in Thailand.Keywords: Next generation sequencing, Exome, Hyperphenylalaninemia, Phenylketonuria, Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency, Newborn screening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5602921/

Recent translation of these findings to further understand the role of inflammation in mood and anxiety-related disorders is also discussed.ResultsInflammation was consistently found to affect basal ganglia and cortical reward and motor circuits to drive reduced motivation and motor activity, as well as anxiety-related brain regions including amygdala, insula and anterior cingulate cortex, which may result from cytokine effects on monoamines and glutamate. Similar relationships between inflammation and altered neurocircuitry have been observed in MDD patients with increased peripheral inflammatory markers, and such work is on the horizon for anxiety disorders and PTSD.ConclusionNeuroimaging effects of inflammation on reward and threat circuitry may be used as biomarkers of inflammation for future development of novel therapeutic strategies to better treat mood and anxiety-related disorders in patients with high inflammation.Keywords:  Neuroimaging, inflammation, cytokines, microglia, depression, anxiety, PTSD, motivation, motor slowing",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5997866/

These deficits are believed to be the result of elevated levels of phenylalanine throughout life. Research on cognitive functioning in adults with PKU (AwPKU) often focuses on domains shown to be compromised in children with PKU, such as attention and executive functions, whereas other cognitive domains have received less attention. This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of cognitive functioning across domains examined in early treated (ET) AwPKU.MethodsA systematic search was performed in Ovid MEDLINE(R), PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase, ScienceDirect, and PubMed for observational studies on cognitive performance in ET AwPKU.ResultsTwenty-two peer-reviewed publications, reporting on outcomes from 16 studies were reviewed. Collectively, the results most consistently showed deficits in vigilance, working memory and motor skills. Deficits in other cognitive domains were less consistently observed or were understudied. Furthermore, despite reports of several associations between cognitive performance and phenylalanine (Phe) levels throughout life the relationship remains unclear. Inconsistencies in findings across studies could be explained by the highly heterogeneous nature of study samples, resulting in large inter- and intra-variability in Phe levels, as well as the use of a variety of tests across cognitive domains, which differ in sensitivity. The long-term cognitive outcomes of early and continuous management of PKU remain unclear.ConclusionsTo better understand the development of cognitive deficits in ET AwPKU, future research would benefit from 1) (inter)national multicentre-studies; 2) more homogeneous study samples; 3) the inclusion of other nutritional measures that might influence cognitive functioning (e.g. Phe fluctuations, Phe:Tyrosine ratio and micronutrients such as vitamin B12); and 4) careful selection of appropriate cognitive tests.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13023-018-0893-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, Cognitive function, Attention, Processing speed, Executive function, Motor skills",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6117942/

We first collected the FTIR spectra of the plasma samples from the rats with and without suffering from ALP. We then performed the chemometric analysis of these FTIR spectra using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). We found that the chemometrics-based FTIR spectroscopy can discriminate the rats with and without ALP. Further analysis on the PLS-DA regression coefficient revealed that the spectral changes, in particular, corresponding to the biochemical changes of proteins in the plasma may be used as potential spectral biomarkers for the diagnostics of lead poisoning. Our work demonstrates the potential of chemometrics-based FTIR spectroscopy as a promising tool for the biochemical analysis of plasma that could consequently enable an objective, convenient and non-destructive diagnostics of lead poisoning.

Median age at first sampling fell from 7 to 5 days between 1980 and 2014 (standard 4–7 days), with 22, 8 and 3 infants sampled >7 days during 2000–2004, 2005–2009 and 2010–2014. Median age at notification was consistently ≤14 days, range falling during 2000–2004, 2005–2009 and 2010–2014 from 6 to 78, 7–52 and 7–32 days with 12 (14.6%), 6 (5.6%) and 5 (4.3%) infants notified >14 days. However 18/123 (14.6%) of infants undergoing second sampling from 2000 onwards breached the ≤26-day standard for notification.

Since 1960, population is screened for hyperphenylalaninemia shortly after birth and submitted to early treatment in order to prevent the major manifestations of the disease. However, the dietetic regimen (phenylalanine free diet) is difficult to maintain, and despite the recommendation to a strict and lifelong compliance, up to 60% of adolescents partially or totally abandons the treatment. The development and the study of new treatments continue to be sought, taking advantage of preclinical models, the most used of which is the PAHenu2 (BTBR ENU2), the genetic murine model of PKU. To date, adult behavioral and neurochemical alterations have been mainly investigated in ENU2 mice, whereas there are no clear indications about the onset of these deficiencies. Here we investigated and report, for the first time, a comprehensive behavioral and neurochemical assay of the developing ENU2 mice. Overall, our findings demonstrate that ENU2 mice are significantly smaller than WT until pnd 24, present a significant delay in the acquisition of tested developmental reflexes, impaired communicative, motor and social skills, and have early reduced biogenic amine levels in several brain areas.

The goal of this study was: (i) to determine if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that associate with blood pressure variation, identified in large studies, are applicable to blood pressure control in subjects from a rural population; (ii) to measure the association of these SNPs with subjects’ responsiveness to the hypertension intervention; and (iii) to identify other SNPs that may help understand patient-specific responses to an intervention. We used a combination of candidate SNPs and genome-wide analyses to test associations with either baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) or change in systolic blood pressure one year after the intervention in two genetically defined ancestral groups: African Americans (AA) and Caucasian Americans (CAU). Of the 48 candidate SNPs, 13 SNPs associated with baseline SBP in our study; however, one candidate SNP, rs592582, also associated with a change in SBP after one year. Using our study data, we identified 4 and 15 additional loci that associated with a change in SBP in the AA and CAU groups, respectively. Our analysis of gene-age interactions identified genotypes associated with SBP improvement within different age groups of our populations. Moreover, our integrative analysis identified AQP4-AS1 and PADI2 as genes whose expression levels may contribute to the pleiotropy of complex traits involved in cardiovascular health and blood pressure regulation in response to an intervention targeting hypertension. In conclusion, the identification of SNPs associated with the success of a hypertension treatment intervention suggests that genetic factors in combination with age may contribute to an individual’s success in lowering SBP. If these findings prove to be applicable to other populations, the use of this genetic variation in making patient-specific interventions may help providers with making decisions to improve patient outcomes. Further investigation is required to determine the role of this genetic variance with respect to the management of hypertension such that more precise treatment recommendations may be made in the future as part of personalized medicine.Keywords: hypertension, GWAS, precision medicine, rural population, SNP-age interaction",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023309/

The study is enrolling both a healthy cohort and a cohort diagnosed with known disorders identified through recent routine NBS. It uses a novel age-based metric to categorize a priori the large amount of data generated by NGS-NBS and interactive online decision aids to guide parental decision-making. Primary outcomes include: (1) assessment of NGS-NBS sensitivity, (2) decision regret, and (3) parental decision-making about NGS-NBS, and, for parents randomized to have the option of requesting them, additional findings (diagnosed and healthy cohorts). Secondary outcomes assess parents’ reactions to the study and to decision-making.Methods/designParticipants are parents and children in a well-child cohort recruited from a prenatal clinic and a diagnosed cohort recruited from pediatric clinics that treat children with disorders diagnosed through traditional NBS (goal of 200 children in each cohort). In phase 1, all parent participants use an online decision aid to decide whether to accept NGS-NBS for their child and provide consent for NGS-NBS. In phase 2, parents who consent to NGS-NBS are randomized to a decision arm or control arm (2:1 allocation) and learn their child’s NGS-NBS results, which include conditions from standard (non-NGS) NBS plus other highly actionable childhood-onset conditions.

Personalized nutrition tailors dietary recommendations to specific biological requirements on the basis of a person’s health status and goals. The biology underpinning these recommendations is complex, and thus any recommendations must account for multiple biological processes and subprocesses occurring in various tissues and must be formed with an appreciation for how these processes interact with dietary nutrients and environmental factors. Therefore, a systems biology–based approach that considers the most relevant interacting biological mechanisms is necessary to formulate the best recommendations to help people meet their wellness goals. Here, the concept of “systems flexibility” is introduced to personalized nutrition biology. Systems flexibility allows the real-time evaluation of metabolism and other processes that maintain homeostasis following an environmental challenge, thereby enabling the formulation of personalized recommendations. Examples in the area of macro- and micronutrients are reviewed.

There are at least 346 disease-causing variants in the CFTR gene, but effective small-molecule therapies exist for only ~10% of them. One option to treat all mutations is CFTR cDNA-based therapy, but clinical trials to date have only been able to stabilise rather than improve lung function disease in patients. While cDNA-based therapy is already a clinical reality for a number of diseases, some animal studies have clearly established that precision genome editing can be significantly more effective than cDNA addition. These observations have led to a number of gene-editing clinical trials for a small number of such genetic disorders. To date, gene-editing strategies to correct CFTR mutations have been conducted exclusively in cell models, with no in vivo gene-editing studies yet described. Here, we highlight some of the key breakthroughs in in vivo and ex vivo gene and base editing in animal models for other diseases and discuss what might be learned from these studies in the development of editing strategies that may be applied to cystic fibrosis as a potential therapeutic approach. There are many hurdles that need to be overcome, including the in vivo delivery of editing machinery or successful engraftment of ex vivo-edited cells, as well as minimising potential off-target effects.

People with cancer may experience nausea and vomiting whilst receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or whilst in the palliative phase of illness.ObjectivesTo assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine when used as an antiemetic in the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting related to cancer in adults.Search methodsWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase for published data on 20th September 2017, as well as ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for unpublished trials. We checked reference lists, and contacted experts in the field and study authors.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of olanzapine versus any comparator with or without adjunct therapies for the prevention or treatment, or both, of nausea or vomiting in people with cancer aged 18 years or older, in any setting, of any duration, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.Data collection and analysisWe used standard Cochrane methodology. We used GRADE to assess quality of evidence for each main outcome. We extracted data for absence of nausea or vomiting and frequency of serious adverse events as primary outcomes. We extracted data for patient perception of treatment, other adverse events, somnolence and fatigue, attrition, nausea or vomiting severity, breakthrough nausea and vomiting, rescue antiemetic use, and nausea and vomiting as secondary outcomes at specified time points.Main resultsWe included 14 RCTs (1917 participants) from high‐, middle‐ and low‐income countries, representing over 24 different cancers. Thirteen studies were in chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting. Oral olanzapine was administered during highly emetogenic (HEC) or moderately emetogenic (MEC) chemotherapy (12 studies); chemoradiotherapy (one study); or palliation (one study). Eight studies await classification and 13 are ongoing.The main comparison was olanzapine versus placebo/no treatment. Other comparisons were olanzapine versus NK1 antagonist, prokinetic, 5‐HT3 antagonist or dexamethasone.We assessed all but one study as having one or more domains that were at high risk of bias. Eight RCTs with fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm, and 10 RCTs with issues related to blinding, were at high risk of bias. We downgraded GRADE assessments due to imprecision, inconsistency and study limitations.Olanzapine versus placebo/no treatmentPrimary outcomesOlanzapine probably doubles the likelihood of no nausea or vomiting during chemotherapy from 25% to 50% (risk ratio (RR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 2.47; 561 participants; 3 studies; solid tumours; HEC or MEC therapy; moderate‐quality evidence) when added to standard therapy. Number needed to treat for additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 5 (95% CI 3.3 ‐ 6.6).It is uncertain if olanzapine increases the risk of serious adverse events (absolute risk difference 0.7% more, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.2) (RR 2.46, 95% CI 0.48 to 12.55; 7 studies, 889 participants, low‐quality evidence).Secondary outcomesFour studies reported patient perception of treatment. One study (48 participants) reported no difference in patient preference. Four reported quality of life but data were insufficient for meta‐analysis.Olanzapine may increase other adverse events (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.96; 332 participants; 4 studies; low‐quality evidence) and probably increases somnolence and fatigue compared to no treatment or placebo (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.30 to 4.18; anticipated absolute risk 8.2% more, 95% CI 1.9 to 18.8; 464 participants; 5 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). Olanzapine probably does not affect all‐cause attrition (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.73; 943 participants; 8 studies; I² = 0%). We are uncertain if olanzapine increases attrition due to adverse events (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 70.16; 422 participants; 6 studies). No participants withdrew due to lack of efficacy.We are uncertain if olanzapine reduces breakthrough nausea and vomiting (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.47; 501 participants; 2 studies; I² = 54%) compared to placebo or no treatment. No studies reported 50% reduction in severity of nausea or vomiting, use of rescue antiemetics, or attrition.We are uncertain of olanzapine's efficacy in reducing acute nausea or vomiting.

There is insufficient evidence to exclude the possibility that 5 mg may confer a lower risk of somnolence and fatigue than 10 mg.Other comparisonsOne study (20 participants) compared olanzapine versus NK1 antagonists. We observed no difference in any reported outcomes.One study (112 participants) compared olanzapine versus a prokinetic (metoclopramide), reporting that olanzapine may increase freedom from overall nausea (RR 2.95, 95% CI 1.73 to 5.02) and overall vomiting (RR 3.03, 95% CI 1.78 to 5.14).One study (62 participants) examined olanzapine versus 5‐HT3 antagonists, reporting olanzapine may increase the likelihood of 50% or greater reduction in nausea or vomiting at 48 hours (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.97) and 24 hours (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.34).One study (229 participants) compared olanzapine versus dexamethasone, reporting that olanzapine may reduce overall nausea (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.18), overall vomiting (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.48), delayed nausea (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.08) and delayed vomiting (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.45).Authors' conclusionsThere is moderate‐quality evidence that oral olanzapine probably increases the likelihood of not being nauseous or vomiting during chemotherapy from 25% to 50% in adults with solid tumours, in addition to standard therapy, compared to placebo or no treatment. There is uncertainty whether it increases serious adverse events. It may increase the likelihood of other adverse events, probably increasing somnolence and fatigue. There is uncertainty about relative benefits and harms of 5 mg versus 10 mg.We identified only RCTs describing oral administration.

To develop new functions, N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) containing 7% sialic acid was separated from GMP to produce G-7%NANA. N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is another type of sialic acid separated from GMP, which has been linked to immune disorders and chronic inflammation-mediated diseases. Therefore, safety was a concern in the use of G-7%NANA in functional foods. To ensure safety, in this study, three genetic toxicity tests on G-7%NANA were conducted. In the reverse mutation test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA, and in the chromosome aberration test using CHO-K1 cells, no significant differences from negative control were found at all dose levels. Similarly, no dose-related differences were evident compared to negative control in the micronucleus test using ICR mice.

When untreated, PKU leads to a significant intellectual deficiency. Although early initiation of dietary therapy allows normal cognitive development, low adherence to treatment may result in neuropsychological deficits, including attention problems. This study was performed to evaluate emotional and behavioral problems in early-treated children and adolescents with PKU using the Child Behavior Checklist – CBCL/6–18 answered by parents.Material/MethodsThe study included 36 PKU patients. The mean scores of internalizing, externalizing, and total problems, syndrome scales, and DSM-IV-oriented scales of patients were compared with those of controls. An analysis to evaluate the importance of adherence to treatment and presence of intellectual disability was also performed.ResultsThere were no significant differences between patients and controls for almost all CBCL/6–18 scales, with the exception of the Attention Problem Scale – CBCL-APS. The mean (±SD) of the CBCL-APS scores of patients (7.86±5.33) was considerably higher than the mean of the controls (6.07±4.37; p=0.016), but not different from the mean of a matched control subsample (6.69±4.46; p=0.316). The difference between the mean of the scores of DSM-IV/ADHD scale of patients (6.72±4.07) and controls (5.73±3.56; p=0.102) was not significant.

Onset may be at any age, from prenatal life to senescence. Many leukodystrophies are degenerative in nature, but some only impair white matter function. The clinical course is mostly progressive, but may also be static or even improving with time. Progressive leukodystrophies are often fatal, and no curative treatment is known. The last decade has witnessed a tremendous increase in the number of defined leukodystrophies also owing to a diagnostic approach combining magnetic resonance imaging pattern recognition and next generation sequencing. Knowledge on white matter physiology and pathology has also dramatically built up. This led to the recognition that only few leukodystrophies are due to mutations in myelin- or oligodendrocyte-specific genes, and many are rather caused by defects in other white matter structural components, including astrocytes, microglia, axons and blood vessels. We here propose a novel classification of leukodystrophies that takes into account the primary involvement of any white matter component. Categories in this classification are the myelin disorders due to a primary defect in oligodendrocytes or myelin (hypomyelinating and demyelinating leukodystrophies, leukodystrophies with myelin vacuolization); astrocytopathies; leuko-axonopathies; microgliopathies; and leuko-vasculopathies. Following this classification, we illustrate the neuropathology and disease mechanisms of some leukodystrophies taken as example for each category. Some leukodystrophies fall into more than one category. Given the complex molecular and cellular interplay underlying white matter pathology, recognition of the cellular pathology behind a disease becomes crucial in addressing possible treatment strategies.Keywords: Leukodystrophy, Myelin, Astrocytes, Oligodendrocytes, Microglia, Axons",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5563342/

Accurate and reliable diagnosis of IEMs by quantifying amino acids (AAs) and acylcarnitines (ACs) using LC-MS/MS systems depend on the establishment of age-specific cut-offs of the analytes. This study aimed to (1) determine the age-specific cut-off values of AAs and ACs in Bangladesh and (2) validate the LC-MS/MS method for diagnosis of the patients with IEMs. A total of 570 enrolled healthy participants were divided into 3 age groups, namely, (1) newborns (1-7 days), (2) 8 days–7 years, and (3) 8–17 years, to establish the age-specific cut-offs for AAs and ACs. Also, 273 suspected patients with IEMs were enrolled to evaluate the reliability of the established cut-off values. Quantitation of AAs and ACs was performed on an automated LC-MS/MS system using dried blood spot (DBS) cards. Then the specimens of the enrolled clinically suspected patients were analyzed by the established method. Nine patients came out as screening positive for different IEMs, including two borderline positive cases of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD). A second-tier test for confirmation of the screening positive cases was conducted by urinary metabolic profiling using gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Out of 9 cases that came out as screening positive by LC-MS/MS, seven cases were confirmed by urinary GC-MS analysis including 3 cases with phenylketonuria, 1 with citrullinemia type II, 1 with methylmalonic acidemia, 1 with isovaleric acidemia and 1 with carnitine uptake defect.

Dried blood spots samples (DBSS) belonging to 521 patients with MS were identified in the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank. For every patient with MS, 1–2 controls with the same sex and birth date were retrieved from the Biobank (n = 972). Level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in the DBSS was measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy. The association between different levels of 25(OH)D and risk of MS was evaluated by odds ratios (OR) calculated in conditional logistic regression models.Results: We observed that lower levels of 25(OH)D in neonates were associated with an increased risk of MS. In the analysis by quintiles, MS risk was highest among individuals in the bottom quintile (<20.7 nmol/L) and lowest among those in the top quintile of 25(OH)D (≥48.9 nmol/L), with an OR for top vs bottom of 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36–0.78). In the analysis treating 25(OH)D as a continuous variable, a 25 nmol/L increase in neonatal 25(OH)D resulted in a 30% reduced risk of MS (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57–0.84).Conclusion: Low concentrations of neonatal vitamin D are associated with an increased risk of MS.

Efforts to date have incorporated a variety of tools and techniques, including Web-based portals, short message service (SMS) text messaging, remote collection of biometric data, electronic coaching, electronic-based health education, secure email communication between visits, and electronic collection of lifestyle and quality-of-life surveys. Each of these tools, used alone or in combination, have demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness. Some of the more promising results have been demonstrated using regular collection of biometric devices, SMS text messaging, secure email communication with clinical teams, and regular reporting of quality-of-life variables. In this study, we seek to incorporate several of the most promising mHealth capabilities in a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) workflow.ObjectiveWe aim to address underlying technology needs and gaps related to the use of mHealth technology and the activation of patients living with type 2 diabetes. Stated differently, we enable supporting technologies while seeking to influence patient activation and self-care activities.MethodsThis is a multisite phased study, conducted within the US Military Health System, that includes a user-centered design phase and a PCMH-based feasibility trial. In phase 1, we will assess both patient and provider preferences regarding the enhancement of the enabling technology capabilities for type 2 diabetes chronic care management. Phase 2 research will be a single-blinded 12-month feasibility study that incorporates randomization principles. Phase 2 research will seek to improve patient activation and self-care activities through the use of the Mobile Health Care Environment with tailored behavioral messaging. The primary outcome measure is the Patient Activation Measure scores. Secondary outcome measures are Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities Measure scores, clinical measures, comorbid conditions, health services resource consumption, and technology system usage statistics.ResultsWe have completed phase 1 data collection. Formal analysis of phase 1 data has not been completed.

Given that sarcopenia has been recognized as a disease entity, effective molecular biomarkers for early diagnosis are required. We recruited 46 normal subjects and 50 patients with moderate sarcopenia aged 60 years and older. Sarcopenia was clinically identified on the basis of the appendicular skeletal muscle index by applying cutoff values derived from the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. The serum levels of 21 potential biomarkers were analyzed and statistically examined. Interleukin 6, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, and insulin-like growth factor 1 levels differed significantly between the normal and sarcopenia groups. However, in each case, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was <0.7. Subsequent combination of the measurements of these biomarkers into a single risk score based on logistic regression coefficients enhanced the accuracy of diagnosis, yielding an AUC value of 0.763. The best cutoff value of 1.529 had 70.0% sensitivity and 78.3% specificity (95% CI = 2.80–21.69, p < 0.0001).

To date, multiple tests are needed in order to complete a full set of fetus disorder screening, which is costly and time consuming. Therefore, an integrated 3‐in‐1 NIPT approach will be in great demand by routine clinical practice in the near future.MethodsWe designed a target capture sequencing panel with an associate bioinformatics pipeline to create a novel multi‐functional NIPT method and we evaluated its performance by testing 22 clinical samples containing aneuploidy, CNV, and single‐gene disorder. Chromosomal aneuploidy and CNV were detected based on the Z‐value approach, whereas single‐gene disorder was identified by using the “pseudo‐tetraploid” model to estimate the best‐suited genotype for each locus.ResultsThe performance of this newly constructed 3‐in‐1 system was promising. We achieved a 100% detection rate for chromosomal aneuploidies (7/7), a 100% diagnosis rate for fetus CNVs larger than 20 Mb (3/3), and an 86.4% accuracy for single‐gene disorder screening (19/22).ConclusionFor the first time, we showed that it is possible to use just a single NIPT test to detect three distinct types of fetus disorder and laid a foundation for developing a cheaper, faster, and multi‐functional NIPT method in the future.Keywords: chromosome aneuploidy, CNVs, NIPT, single‐gene disorder, target sequencing",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6465655/

Recently developed new techniques, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9), significantly facilitate the progression in this field. However, mutations associated with the double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) introduced by these systems hampered their direct usage in clinic. In order to prevent the mutations caused by DSBs, we have designed a novel mean to induce homology-directed recombination (HDR) without DSBs, i.e., the fusion protein of RecA with cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). The involvement of RecA in these fusion proteins will play important roles in formation of the nucleoprotein filament with single strand DNA (ssDNA) in vitro and promoting HDR in vivo; whereas the involvement of CPP in these fusion proteins will mainly play a role in facilitating cellular intake/uptake of the nucleoprotein filaments. Our results indicated that certain amount of the fusion proteins expressed in bacteria is in soluble fraction, whereas majority of the fusion proteins expressed in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells is in soluble fraction. Interestingly, expression of these fusion proteins in bacteria completely blocked cell growth, whereas expression of them in BHK cells significantly inhibited cell growth, implying that these fusion proteins may bind to ssDNA regions, such as ssDNA regions in DNA replication forks, and inhibit cell growth.

We aimed to study the effects of sapropterin (Kuvan), an orally active synthetic form of tetrahydrobiopterin on eNOS uncoupling and congenital heart defects (CHDs) induced by pregestational diabetes mellitus in mice.Methods and ResultsAdult female mice were induced to pregestational diabetes mellitus by streptozotocin and bred with normal male mice to produce offspring. Pregnant mice were treated with sapropterin or vehicle during gestation. CHDs were identified by histological analysis. Cell proliferation, eNOS dimerization, and reactive oxygen species production were assessed in the fetal heart. Pregestational diabetes mellitus results in a spectrum of CHDs in their offspring. Oral treatment with sapropterin in the diabetic dams significantly decreased the incidence of CHDs from 59% to 27%, and major abnormalities, such as atrioventricular septal defect and double‐outlet right ventricle, were absent in the sapropterin‐treated group. Lineage tracing reveals that pregestational diabetes mellitus results in decreased commitment of second heart field progenitors to the outflow tract, endocardial cushions, and ventricular myocardium of the fetal heart. Notably, decreased cell proliferation and cardiac transcription factor expression induced by maternal diabetes mellitus were normalized with sapropterin treatment. Furthermore, sapropterin administration in the diabetic dams increased eNOS dimerization and lowered reactive oxygen species levels in the fetal heart.ConclusionsSapropterin treatment in the diabetic mothers improves eNOS coupling, increases cell proliferation, and prevents the development of CHDs in the offspring. Thus, sapropterin may have therapeutic potential in preventing CHDs in pregestational diabetes mellitus.Keywords: animal model cardiovascular disease, cardiac embryology, congenital cardiac defect, diabetes mellitusSubject Categories: Animal Models of Human Disease, Basic Science Research, Congenital Heart Disease, Pharmacology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6404194/

It was aimed to determine the views and experiences of healthcare professionals (HCPs) and parents on communication and interaction during the period of confirmatory testing following a positive screening result.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were undertaken with parents of children who had received a positive ENBS result and HCPs who had been involved with the diagnosis and support of parents. Ten parents and 11 healthcare professionals took part in the in-depth interviews. Questions considered the journey from the positive screening result through confirmatory testing to a confirmed diagnosis and the communication and interaction between the parents and HCPs that they had been experienced. Key themes were identified through thematic analysis.ResultsThe results point to a number of elements within the path through confirmatory testing that are difficult for parents and could be further developed to improve the experience. These include the way in which the results are communicated to parents, rapid turnaround of results, offering a consistent approach, exploring interventions to support family relationships and reviewing the workload and scheduling implications for healthcare professionals.ConclusionsAs technology enables newborn screening of a larger number of conditions, there is an increasing need to consider and mediate the potentially negative effects on families.

The proposita, after normal growth and psychomotor development, at age of 30 months presented with a rapidly progressive gait disturbance with frequent falls and with loss of acquired language skills. Magnetic resonance imaging showed leukoencephalopathy. Biochemical blood essays showed a 91% reduction in the arylsulfatase A activity and genetic analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations of the Arylsulfatase A gene, enabling diagnosis of MLD. Subsequently, the patient had further rapid deterioration of motor and cognitive functions and developed drug-resistant epilepsy. At 4 years and 7 months of age bilateral thelarche occurred. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a small pituitary gland, extensive signal changes of the brain white matter, increased choline, decreased N-acetyl-aspartate and presence of lactate on 1HMR spectroscopy. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated a slightly augmented uterine longitudinal diameter (42 mm). The gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test revealed a pubertal LH peak of 12.9 UI/l.

The results showed that there is not only a consanguineous relation, but also a difference in PAH characters of mutations between Kermanshah and the other two parts of western Iran (Hamadan and Lorestan). Also, it seems that the spectrum of mutations in western Iran is relatively distinct from other parts of the country, suggesting that this region might be a special PAH gene distribution region. Moreover, our findings can be useful in the identification of genotype to phenotype relationship in patients, and provide future abilities for confirmatory diagnostic testing, prognosis, and predict the severity of PKU patients.

Thyroid hormone (TH) is involved in oligodendrocyte development and myelination, however, whether transient hypothyroidism is associated with oligodendrocyte dysplasia and abnormal myelination is unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate correlations among TH levels, neurodevelopmental outcomes and white matter (WM) microstructure in premature infants. The authors designed a cohort study recruiting 81 premature infants (age, 23–35 weeks). A total of 17 were born with a gestational age (GA) <30 weeks (early preterm group) and 64 of them were born with a GA ≥30 weeks (late preterm group). For outcome measurement, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels at 0, 18, and 24 h of admission were measured. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed using Bayley III test. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to explore the characterization of WM microstructure. The data demonstrated that GA, however not TSH level was associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes in the following 2 years. Fractional anisotrophy (FA) increased with TSH0 levels over anterior limb of internal capsule, while axial diffusivity decreased with TSH0 levels over splenium of corpus callosum (CC). The late preterm group had more intact WM integrity over the internal and external capsule (EC) in FA compared with the early preterm group. Infants with motor dysfunction had significantly increased mean diffusivity (MD) values at regions of interest in the genu and splenium of CC. The results of the present study demonstrated that GA, however not transient hypothyroidism influenced neurodevelopmental outcomes in the premature infants. FA increased with age in a regionally-specific manner over regions of the internal capsule and EC. MD may act as a potential predictor for motor function in premature babies.Keywords: transient hypothyroidism in premature infants, thyroid stimulating hormone, performance developmental index, diffusion tensor imaging, mean diffusivity",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5772951/

The Urea Cycle Disorders Longitudinal Study is a natural history study that collects data from regular clinical follow-up and neuropsychological testing. This report examines links between biochemical markers (ammonia, glutamine, arginine, citrulline) and primary neuropsychological endpoints in 3 distal disorders, argininosuccinic acid synthetase deficiency (ASD or citrullinemia type I), argininosuccinic acid lyase deficiency (ASA or ALD) and arginase deficiency (ARGD). Laboratory results and test scores from neuropsychological evaluations were assessed in 145 study participants, ages 3 years and older, with ASD (n=64), ASA (n=65) and ARGD (n=16). Mean full scale IQ was below the population mean of 100 ± 15 for all groups: (ASD = 79 ± 24; ASA = 71 ± 21; ARGD = 65 ± 19). The greatest deficits were noted in visual performance and motor skills for all groups. While ammonia levels remain prominent as prognostic biomarkers, other biomarkers may be equally valuable as correlates of neuropsychological functioning. Cumulative exposure to the biomarkers included in the study proved to be highly sensitive indicators of neuropsychological outcomes, even when below the cut-off levels generally considered toxic. Blood levels of biomarkers obtained on the day of neuropsychological evaluations were not correlated with measures of functioning for any disorder in any domain. The importance of cumulative exposure supports early identification and confirms the need for well-controlled management of all biochemical abnormalities (and not just ammonia) that occur in urea cycle disorders.Keywords: urea cycle disorders, cognitive outcomes, neuropsychological, argininosuccinic acid synthetase deficiency, argininosuccinic acid lyase deficiency, arginase deficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6041144/

The present study aimed to explore potential therapeutic targets which may participate in the recovery of HAPC by studying the mechanisms of reducing the hemoglobin (HB) concentration during re-oxygenation. A total of 14 and 13 subjects were recruited over a 5,300 m distance and 5,170 m area. The patients were classified into HAPC or control groups based on their HB value. Plasma samples were collected on the day when they finished their stay in plateau for a year, and on the 180th day following their reaching in plain. Metabolic profiling was conducted by UPLC-QTOF/MS. MetaboAnalyst platform was performed to explore the most perturbed metabolic pathways. A panel of differential metabolites were obtained in the recovery phase of HAPC and control groups. The present study identified the uniquely upregulated pentose phosphate pathway in HAPC subjects, along with a significantly decreased HB level. The findings were verified via a direct comparison between HAPC and control subjects at a high altitude. An increased pentose phosphate pathway was identified in control groups compared with HAPC subjects. An elevated pentose phosphate pathway may therefore participate in the recovery of HAPC, whereas a downregulated pentose phosphate pathway may contribute to hypoxia-induced erythrocytosis.

This study aims to gain more knowledge on the attitudes towards the inclusion of children as research subjects in genomic research and towards the disclosure of pertinent and incidental findings to the parents and the child.MethodsQualitative data were collected from interviews with a wide range of informants: experts engaged in genomic research, clinical geneticists, persons with mental disorders, relatives, and blood donors. Quantitative data were collected from a cross-sectional web-based survey among 1227 parents and 1406 non-parents who were potential stakeholders in psychiatric genomic research.ResultsParticipants generally expressed positive views on children’s participation in genomic research. The informants in the qualitative interviews highlighted the age of the child as a critical aspect when disclosing genetic information. Other important aspects were the child’s right to an autonomous choice, the emotional burden of knowing imposed on both the child and the parents, and the possibility of receiving beneficial clinical information regarding the future health of the child. Nevertheless, there was no consensus whether the parent or the child should receive the findings. A majority of survey stakeholders agreed that children should be able to participate in genomic research. The majority agreed that both pertinent and incidental findings should be returned to the parents and to the child when of legal age. Having children does not affect the stakeholder’s attitudes towards the inclusion of children as research subjects in genomic research.ConclusionOur findings illustrate that both the child’s right to autonomy and the parents’ interest to be informed are important factors that are found valuable by the participants.

As with many fields, one of the keys to anticipating the future is to understand the past. The term “inborn error of metabolism” was first coined in 1908 by Sir Archibald Garrod, in reference to four disorders (alkaptonuria, pentosuria, cystinuria and albinism). The first (and still most definitive) textbook on the subject, “The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease” was initially published in 1960 and covered 80 disorders in 1,477 pages. After the eighth edition of this text became unwieldy at 6,338 pages in 4 volumes covering more than 1,000 disorders, the book was changed to an online reference text with 259 chapters and is still growing. Current newborn screening on a few dried blood spots on filter paper identifies more than 1 in 2,000 newborns as having a metabolic disorder. The availability of metabolomic and genomic analyses is resulting in the diagnosis of many new disorders. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has provided treatments for previously untreatable metabolic disorders, and the promise of gene therapy on the near horizon will certainly revolutionize the field.Keywords:  Inborn error of metabolism, newborn screening, enzyme replacement therapy, gene therapy",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6331363/

While numerous studies have shown association between high plasma Phe concentration and intellectual impairment, it is not clear whether increased Phe fluctuations also observed in PKU affect the brain as well. To investigate this, time-resolved in vivo data on Phe and competing large neutral amino acid (LNAA) concentrations in neurons are needed, but cannot be acquired readily with current methods. We have used in silico modeling as an alternative approach to characterize the interactive dynamics of Phe and competing LNAAs (CL) in the neurovascular unit (NVU). Our results suggest that plasma Phe fluctuations can propagate into the NVU cells and change there the concentration of LNAAs, with the highest magnitude of this effect observed at low frequency and high amplitude-to-mean ratio of the plasma Phe concentration fluctuations. Our model further elucidates the effect of therapeutic LNAA supplementation in PKU, showing how abnormal concentrations of Phe and CL in the NVU move thereby toward normal physiologic levels.Keywords: phenylketonuria, L-phenylalanine fluctuation, neurovascular unit, amino acid transporter, large neutral amino acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6454150/

Cultures of hippocampal NSCs were randomly divided into four groups consisting of an untreated control, cells treated with MK-801, NMDA and a combination of MK801 and NMDA (M+N). Proliferative and apoptotic responses for each of the experimental groups were determined by MTS and flow cytometry. The results revealed that MK-801 and NMDA exerted significant effects on hippocampal NSCs proliferation. Cell survival rates decreased in MK-801, NMDA and M+N treated groups compared with the control group. Cells survival rates in NMDA and M+N treated groups increased compared with the MK-801 treated group. MK-801 and NMDA were demonstrated to significantly affect apoptosis in hippocampal NSCs. Total and early stages of apoptosis in MK-801 and NMDA groups significantly increased compared with the control group. Total and early apoptosis of NSCs in the M+N group significantly decreased compared with MK-801 and NMDA groups. Late apoptosis of NSCs in MK-801 and NMDA groups significantly decreased compared with the control group. Late apoptosis of NSCs in the M+N group significantly increased compared with MK-801 and NMDA groups. The present study revealed that MK-801 inhibited proliferation and increased apoptosis in hippocampal NSCs.

We evaluated plasma CoQ values in 597 individuals (age range 1 month to 43 years, average 11 years), studied during the period 2005–2016. Patients were classified into 6 different groups: control group of healthy participants, phenylketonuric patients (PKU), patients with mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), patients with other inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), patients with neurogenetic diseases, and individuals with neurological diseases with no genetic diagnosis. Plasma total CoQ was measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and ultraviolet detection at 275 nm. ANOVA with Bonferroni correction showed that plasma CoQ values were significantly lower in the PKU and MPS groups than in controls and neurological patients. The IEM group showed intermediate values that were not significantly different from those of the controls. In PKU patients, the Chi-Square test showed a significant association between having low plasma CoQ values and being classic PKU patients. The percentage of neurogenetic and other neurological patients with low CoQ values was low (below 8%). In conclusión, plasma CoQ monitoring in selected groups of patients with different IEM (especially in PKU and MPS patients, but also in IEM under protein-restricted diets) seems advisable to prevent the possibility of a chronic blood CoQ suboptimal status in such groups of patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6349877/

Many conditions covered by newborn screening represent classic (autosomal recessive) Mendelian disorders. Parents of screen-positive infants therefore often come to learn that they are carriers of the disease, and face a decision whether to test for it in future pregnancies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2015–2017 with 34 Israeli parents whose child was screen positive. Three major themes emanated from the parents’ attitudes toward prenatal testing for the disease in prospective hypothetical pregnancies: rejection of prenatal testing for the disease associated with the screen positive, and relying instead on newborn screening to reveal if a future baby is also sick (18/34, 53%); support of prenatal testing to get more information (7/34, 21%) and support of prenatal testing in order to abort in case of a test positive (9/34, 26%). We discuss the importance of newborn screening for reproductive decision-making, highlighting the arguments associated with positive and negative parental views of the possibility of having another child with the same condition associated with the screen-positive of the child that had already been born. The conclusions challenge the common assertion that parents pursue the dream of the “perfect child” through prenatal diagnosis that “naturally” leads to selective abortion. The diversity of views expressed by Israeli parents of screen-positive children highlights the diversity of normative scripts of “genetic responsibility” in the context of parenthood.Keywords: Israel, Newborn screening, Prenatal genetic diagnosis, Disability, Reproductive decisions",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325039/

The aim of this study is to evaluate genetic services in order to identify and classify delivery models for the provision of genetic testing in European and in extra-European countries.Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using five electronic resources. Inclusion criteria were that studies be published in English or Italian during the period 2000–2015 and carried out in European or extra-European countries (Canada, USA, Australia, or New Zealand).Results: 148 genetic programs were identified in 117 articles and were delivered mostly in the UK (59, 40%), USA (35, 24%) or Australia (16, 11%). The programs were available nationally (66; 45%), regionally (49; 33%) or in urban areas (21, 14%). Ninety-six (64%) of the programs were integrated into healthcare systems, 48 (32.21%) were pilot programs and five (3%) were direct-to-consumer genetic services. The genetic tests offered were mainly for BRCA1/2 (59, 40%), Lynch syndrome (23, 16%), and newborn screening (18, 12%). Healthcare professionals with different backgrounds are increasingly engaged in the provision of genetic services. Based on which healthcare professionals have prominent roles in the respective patient care pathways, genetic programs were classified into five models: (i) the geneticists model; (ii) the primary care model; (iii) the medical specialist model; (iv) the population screening programs model; and (v) the direct-to-consumer model.Conclusions: New models of genetic service delivery are currently under development worldwide to address the increasing demand for accessible and affordable services. These models require the integration of genetics into all medical specialties, collaboration among different healthcare professionals, and the redistribution of professional roles. An appropriate model for genetic service provision in a specific setting should ideally be defined according to the type of healthcare system, the genetic test provided within a genetic program, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

Methods: The electrochemical analysis of TY was displayed through cyclic voltammetry (CV)
and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The surface morphology of SDS/CNTPE and bare
carbon nanotube past electrode (BCNTPE) was reviewed trough field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM).

Results: The functioning SDS/CNTPE shows a voltammetric response with superior sensitivity
towards TY. This study was conducted using a phosphate buffer solution having neutral pH
(pH=7.0). The correlation between the oxidation peak current of TY and concentration of TY
was achieved linearly in CV method, in the range 2.0×10-6 to 5 ×10-5 M with the detection limit
729 nM and limit of quantification 2.43 μM. The investigated voltammetric study at SDS/CNTPE

However, the aetiological link between metabolic alteration and the observed diseases is still elusive. This includes the correlation between the abnormally high levels of homocysteine and quinolinic acid in Alzheimer's disease, as well as the accumulation of oncometabolites in malignant processes. Here, we suggest and discuss a possible mechanistic insight into metabolite accumulation in conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Our hypothesis is based on the demonstrated ability of metabolites to form amyloid-like structures in inborn error of metabolism disorders and the potential of such metabolite amyloids to promote protein aggregation. This notion can provide a new paradigm for neurodegeneration and cancer, as both conditions were linked to loss of function due to protein aggregation. Similar to the well-established observation of amyloid formation in many degenerative disorders, the formation of amyloids by tumour-suppressor proteins, including p53, was demonstrated in malignant states. Moreover, this new paradigm could fill the gap in understanding the high occurrence of specific types of cancer among genetic error of metabolism patients.

DeviCNV builds linear regression models with bootstrapping for every probe to capture the relationship between read depth of an individual probe and the median of read depth values of all probes in the sample. From the regression models, it estimates the read depth ratio of the observed and predicted read depth with confidence interval for each probe which is applied to a circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm to obtain CNV candidates. Then, it assigns confidence scores to those candidates based on the reliability and strength of the CNV signals inferred from the read depth ratios of the probes within them. Finally, it also provides gene-centric plots with confidence levels of CNV candidates for visual inspection. We applied DeviCNV to targeted NGS data generated for newborn screening and demonstrated its ability to detect novel pathogenic CNVs from clinical samples.ConclusionsWe propose a new pragmatic method for detecting CNVs in targeted NGS data with an intuitive visualization and a systematic method to assign confidence scores for candidate CNVs.

Here we report that this rescue results from use of asparagine in protein synthesis. All mammalian cell lines tested lacked cytosolic asparaginase activity and could not utilize asparagine to produce other amino acids or biosynthetic intermediates. Instead, most glutamine-deprived cell lines are capable of sufficient glutamine synthesis to maintain essential amino acid uptake and production of the glutamine-dependent biosynthetic precursors – with the exception of asparagine. While experimental introduction of cytosolic asparaginase could enhance the synthesis of glutamine, increase TCA cycle anaplerosis and the synthesis of nucleotide precursors, cytosolic asparaginase suppressed the growth and survival of cells in glutamine-depleted media in vitro and severely compromised the in vivo growth of tumor xenografts.

This review integrates newer data showing that child appetitive traits also have a genetic component.Recent FindingsCaregiver feeding behaviors robustly correlate with child eating behaviors; however there is also a strong heritable component.SummaryThe satiety cascade delineates the biological drive underlying hunger, satiation and satiety. Innate individual differences exist for the components of the satiety cascade, which may explain the heritability of child eating behaviors. However, given the correlation of caregiver feeding behaviors with child eating behaviors any etiological model should include both genetic/biological components and environmental. Integrating the biological etiology of child eating behaviors into the current environmental model has implications for tailoring feeding advice which needs to move from a “one size fits all” approach, to one that is tailored to individual differences in children’s biological drives to appetite.Keywords: appetitive traits, pediatric obesity, heritability, parenting, feeding style",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6002846/

PKU is identified through newborn screening in developed countries, and treatment begins immediately to prevent these severe consequences. When a child is diagnosed, parents must assume immediate responsibility for the management of PKU and prevention of neurological damage. Quantitative studies have identified significant psychosocial stressors for parents, but little is known about how the parents experience this process. This study aimed to explore the experiences of parents of children with PKU under the age of two. It is the first study to examine these experiences in this way. Seven parents were interviewed about their experiences, and interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse the data. Three main themes were identified: control, striving for normality and acceptance of PKU as a continuum. Links between the themes and processes underpinning the results were explored with relation to existing literature and theories from a clinical psychology perspective. The role of acceptance of PKU was central to the parent’s experiences.

Recent advances in biotechnology and genetic testing mean that the investigations available to perform for children under 5 years are increasing and are more sensitive than previously. This change in availability and type of testing necessitates an update in the recommendations for investigating GDD.MethodsWe conducted a review of the literature from 2006 to 2016 to identify articles with evidence relating to the investigation of developmental delay in children under the age of 5 years. We collated the evidence into first-line and second-line investigations and, where available, on their yield and cost implications.ResultsWe have provided up-to-date guidance for first-line and second-line investigations for children with GDD under the age of 5 years. Recent evidence demonstrates that genetic testing for all children with unexplained GDD should be first line, if an exogenous cause is not already established. Our review of the literature demonstrates that all patients, irrespective of severity of GDD, should have investigations for treatable conditions. Evidence demonstrates that the yield for treatable conditions is higher than previously thought and that investigations for these metabolic conditions should be considered as first line. Additional second-line investigations can be led by history, examination and developmental trajectories.DiscussionWe may need to update present recommendations in the UK for investigation of developmental delay. This would include microarray testing as first line and a more thorough approach to investigations for metabolic disorders that can be treated.

Responders to BH4 may experience a reduction in certain nutrients if not compensated through intact foods or supplements. This study investigated B6, B12, folate, and iron status based on blood levels and dietary intake in patients with PKU responsive to BH4 over 1 year.MethodsFifty-eight patients with PKU, ages 4–50 years were recruited and initiated on BH4 therapy. Patients were monitored for BH4 response, and nutritional status was recorded at regular intervals over 12 months. The analysis included 33 patients with known BH4 response status and complete nutritional data. Nutrient intake was determined by National Data System for Research (NDSR) analysis of self reported 3 day diet records and compared to Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). Blood biomarkers were analyzed by Quest Diagnostics and compared to laboratory reference ranges. Patient laboratory values were compared to controls from the National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES). Differences in nutrient intakes across time points were examined, stratified by age, using nonparametric methods. Statistical analyses were completed with SAS 9.4, with significance set at α = 0.05.ResultsMedical food intake declined among pediatric (p < 0.01) and adult (p = 0.06) BH4 responders over 1 year. Among those < 18 years of age, mean percent of calories obtained from MF declined from 21.3 to 4.7%. In adults, percent calories from MF dropped from 19.5 to 4.0%. Though maintaining laboratory and dietary values within reference ranges, responders < 18 years experienced a significant decline in serum B12 (p = 0.01), dietary folate (p = 0.006), and dietary iron (p = 0.004) over the study.ConclusionAlthough mean dietary and laboratory values for B12, B6, folate, and iron in BH4 responders and non-responders were adequate at baseline and 12-month follow-up, responders experienced a significant decline in serum B12 over 1 year, which may be explained by decreased intake of fortified MF. Both response groups had lower serum B12 than NHANES controls at baseline and 12 months. Results indicate a need to monitor B12 concentrations and consider micronutrient supplementation, with special attention to pediatric patients with PKU.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13023-018-0923-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), Sapropterin, B-vitamin deficiency, Iron deficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6206913/

Here we review the contribution of etiologies due to various metabolic disorders in the pathology of WS. These may include metabolic errors in organic molecules involved in amino acid and glucose metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, metal metabolism, pyridoxine deficiency or dependency, or acidurias in organelles such as mitochondria and lysosomes.

Likewise, they are important in the regulation of body temperature, the increase/decrease of blood pressure or intake of nutrition, as well as in the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, hormones and alkaloids. Additionally, it was confirmed that these compounds can be considered as useful biomarkers for the diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of several neuroendocrine and cardiovascular disorders, including neuroendocrine tumours (NET), schizophrenia and Parkinson’s Disease. Due to the fact that BAs are chemically unstable, light-sensitive and possess a high tendency for spontaneous oxidation and decomposition at high pH values, their determination is a real challenge. Moreover, their concentrations in biological matrices are extremely low. These issues make the measurement of BA levels in biological matrices problematic and the application of reliable bioanalytical methods for the extraction and determination of these molecules is needed. This article presents an overview of the most recent trends in the quantification of BAs in human samples with a special focus on liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography (GC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) techniques. Thus, new approaches and technical possibilities applied in these methodologies for the assessment of BA profiles in human samples and the priorities for future research are reported and critically discussed.

However, much current clinical research and practice falls short of this objective by selecting outcome measures which do not capture patient value to the fullest. In this Opinion, we discuss Patient-Centered Outcomes Measures (PCOMs), which have the potential to systematically incorporate patient perspectives to measure those outcomes that matter most to patients. We argue for greater multi-stakeholder collaboration to develop PCOMs, with rare disease patients and families at the center. Beyond advancing the science of patient input, PCOMs are powerful tools to translate care or observed treatment benefit into an ‘interpretable’ measure of patient benefit, and thereby help demonstrate clinical effectiveness. We propose mixed methods psychometric research as the best route to deliver fit-for-purpose PCOMs in rare diseases, as this methodology brings together qualitative and quantitative research methods in tandem with the explicit aim to efficiently utilise data from small samples. And, whether one opts to develop a brand-new PCOM or to select or adapt an existing outcome measure for use in a rare disease, the anchors remain the same: patients, their daily experience of the rare disease, their preferences, core concepts and values. Ultimately, existing value frameworks, registries, and outcomes-based contracts largely fall short of consistently measuring the full range of outcomes that matter to patients.

However, ethnicity affects human disease and environment-gene interactions, including nutrient intake. Historically, isolated human populations with different genetic backgrounds have adapted to distinct environments with varying food sources. Ethnicity is relevant to the interaction of food intake with genes and disease susceptibility; yet major health agencies generally do not recommend food and nutrients codified by population genotypes and their frequencies. In this paper, we have consolidated published nutrigenetic variants and examine their frequencies in human superpopulations to prioritize these variants for future investigation of population-specific genotype-directed nutrition. The nutrients consumed by individuals interact with their genome and may alter disease risk. Herein, we searched the literature, designed a data model, and manually curated hundreds of papers. The resulting database houses 101 variants that reached significance (p < 0.05), from 35 population studies. Nutrigenetic variants associated with modified nutrient intake have the potential to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and several other diseases. Since many nutrigenetic studies have identified a major variant in some populations, we suggest that superpopulation-specific genotype-directed nutrition modifications be prioritized for future study and evaluation.

Despite the fact that effective, curative treatments are available with optimal clinical outcomes when diagnosed early, newborn screening does not exist for the majority of these diseases due to the lack of detectable, specific biomarkers or validated methods for population-based screening. Peptide immunoaffinity enrichment coupled with selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (immuno-SRM) is a sensitive proteomic assay, involving antibody-mediated peptide capture, that allows for concurrent quantification of multiple analytes. This assay has promise for use in potential newborn screening of PIDDs that lead to diminished or absent target proteins in the majority of cases.Objective: To determine and evaluate if a multiplex assay based on immuno-SRM is able to reliably and precisely distinguish affected patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), and CD3ϵ-associated severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) from one another and from unaffected normal control dried blood spot (DBS) samples.Methods: We performed a blinded, multiplexed analysis of proteolytically-generated peptides from WASp, BTK, and CD3ϵ (for WAS, XLA, and SCID, respectively) in DBS samples from 42 PIDD patients, 40 normal adult controls, and 62 normal newborns. The peptide ATPase copper transporting protein (ATP7B) 1056 was simultaneously monitored for quality assurance purposes.Results: The immuno-SRM assays reliably quantified the target peptides in DBS and accurately distinguished affected patients from normal controls. Analysis of signature peptides found statistically significant reduction or absence of peptide levels in affected patients compared to control groups in each case (WASp and BTK: p = 0.0001, SCID: p = 0.05). Intra and inter-assay precision ranged from 11 to 22% and 11 to 43% respectively; linearity (1.39–2000 fmol peptide), and stability (≤ 0.09% difference in 72 h) showed high precision for the multiplexed assay. Inter-laboratory assay comparison showed high concordance for measured peptide concentrations, with R2 linearity ≥ 0.97 for the WASp 274, CD3ϵ 197, BTK 407, and ATP7B 1056 peptides.Conclusion: Immuno-SRM-based quantification of proteotypic peptides from WASp, BTK, and CD3ϵ in DBS distinguishes relevant PIDD cases from one another and from controls, raising the possibility of employing this approach for large-scale multiplexed newborn screening of selective PIDDs.Keywords: peptide immunoaffinity enrichment coupled to SRM (immuno-SRM), Stable Isotope Standards and Capture by Anti-Peptide Antibodies (SISCAPA), Primary Immunodeficiency Disorders (PIDD), Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA), Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), newborn screening (NBS), Dried Blood Spot (DBS)",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6288356/

Hepatic estrogen receptors and the release of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) are critical links between liver function and the reproductive system. However, the role of liver in pubertal development is not fully understood. To explore this question, we applied transcriptomic analyses to liver samples of pre- and post-pubertal Brahman heifers and identified differentially expressed (DE) genes and genes encoding transcription factors (TFs). Differential expression of genes suggests potential biological mechanisms and pathways linking liver function to puberty. The analyses identified 452 DE genes and 82 TF with significant contribution to differential gene expression by using a regulatory impact factor metric. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor was observed as the most down-regulated gene (P = 0.003) in post-pubertal heifers and we propose this gene influences pubertal development in Brahman heifers. Additionally, co-expression network analysis provided evidence for three TF as key regulators of liver function during pubertal development: the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6, PBX homeobox 2, and polybromo 1. Pathway enrichment analysis identified transforming growth factor-beta and Wnt signaling pathways as significant annotation terms for the list of DE genes and TF in the co-expression network. Molecular information regarding genes and pathways described in this work are important to further our understanding of puberty onset in Brahman heifers.Keywords: Bos indicus, puberty, gene expression, RNA sequencing, gene network, liver",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5869259/

We estimated the between-phenotype correlation matrix using the summary statistics of individual phenotype GWAS analyses, and developed genetic association tests for multiple phenotypes by accounting for between-phenotype correlation without the need to access individual-level data. Since genetic variants often affect multiple phenotypes differently across the genome and the between-phenotype correlation can be arbitrary, we proposed robust and powerful multiple phenotype testing procedures by jointly testing a common mean and a variance component in linear mixed models for summary statistics. We computed the p-values of the proposed tests analytically. This computational advantage makes our methods practically appealing in large-scale GWASs. We performed simulation studies to show that the proposed tests maintained correct type I error rates, and to compare their powers in various settings with the existing methods. We applied the proposed tests to a GWAS Global Lipids Genetics Consortium summary statistics data set and identified additional genetic variants that were missed by the original single-trait analysis.Keywords: Correlated phenotypes, Fisher Method, Linear Mixed Models, Pleiotropy, Summary Statistics, Variance Component Test",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5743780/

Nurses play a critical role in the effort to make patients fully engaged in their disease management. Trainings devoted to increase nurses' skills and knowledge to assess and promote patient engagement are today a medical education priority. To address this goal, we developed a program of nurse education training in patient engagement strategies (NET-PES). This paper presents pilot feasibility study and preliminary participants outcomes for NET-PES.Methods: This is a pilot feasibility study of a 2-session program on patient engagement designed to improve professional nurses' ability to engage chronic patients in their medical journey; the training mainly focused on passing patient engagement assessment skills to clinicians as a crucial mean to improve care experience. A pre-post pilot evaluation of NET-PES included 46 nurses working with chronic conditions. A course specific competence test has been developed and validated to measure patient engagement skills. The design included self-report questionnaire completed before and after the training for evaluation purposes. Participants met in a large group for didactic presentations and then they were split into small groups in which they used role-play and case discussion to reflect upon the value of patient engagement measurement in relation to difficult cases from own practice.Results: Forty-six nurses participated in the training program. The satisfaction questionnaire showed that the program met the educational objectives and was considered to be useful and relevant by the participants. Results demonstrated changes on clinicians' attitudes and skills in promoting engagement. Moreover, practitioners demonstrated increases on confidence regarding their ability to support their patients' engagement in the care process.Conclusions: Learning programs teaching nurses about patient engagement strategies and assessment measures in clinical practice are key in supporting the realization of patient engagement in healthcare. Training nurses in this area is feasible and accepted and might have an impact on their ability to engage patients in the chronic care journey. Due to the limitation of the research design, further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of such a program and to verify if the benefits envisaged in this pilot are maintained on a long-term perspective and to test results by employing a randomized control study design.Keywords: patient engagement, patient engagement measurement, nursing staff, hospital, professional-patient relation, empowerment, educational program, patient activation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5222845/

Aneuploidy screening if combined with PND for a given single gene disorder, can help to detect any common aneuploidy as well as aiding sample authenticity and other probable complications which may arise during such procedures. This study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel panel of STR markers combined as a multiplex PCR kit (HapScreen™ kit) for the detection of β-thalassemia, aneuploidy screening, ruling in/out maternal cell contamination (MCC), and sample authenticity. The kit uses 7 STR markers linked to β-globin gene (HBB) as well as using 9 markers for quantitative analysis of chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y. Selection of the markers was to do linkage analysis with β-globin gene, segregation analysis and to perform a preliminary aneuploidy screening of fetal samples respectively. These markers (linked to the β-globin gene) were tested on more than 2185 samples and showed high heterozygosity values (68.4–91.4%). From 2185 fetal cases we found 3 cases of non-paternity, 5 cases of MCC, one case of sample mix-up and one case of trisomy 21 which otherwise may have end up to misdiagnosis. This kit was also successfully used on 231 blastomeres for 29 cases of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and screening (PGS). The markers used for simultaneous analysis of haplotype segregation and aneuploidy screening proved to be very valuable to confirm results obtained from direct mutation detection methods (i.e. ARMS, MLPA and sequencing) and aneuploidy screening.Subject terms: Genetics, Haplotypes",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6520367/

In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of p-coumaric acid. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of a major PAL from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor; SbPAL1), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. This first crystal structure of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from 189Ala-Ser-Gly191 residues and the bound l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E2 reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups. Taken together, this approach identified critical residues and explained substrate preferences among PAL isozymes in sorghum and other monocots, which can serve as the basis for the engineering of plants with enhanced biomass conversion properties, disease resistance, or nutritional quality.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5813539/

In two consecutive years, the total public expenditures on OMPs were calculated by using annual EUR exchange rates. Annual total public expenditures were calculated per capita, and as a proportion of GDP, total public pharmaceutical and healthcare budgets. Differences between countries were compared by calculating the deviations from the average spending of countries.ResultsIn 2015 29.4–92.8% of the 83 OMPs were available with any kind of public reimbursement in participant countries including special reimbursement on an individual basis. In Austria, Belgium and France more OMPs were accessible for patients with public reimbursement than in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Standard reimbursement through retail pharmacies and/or hospitals was applied from 0 to 41% of OMPs. The average annual total public expenditure ranged between 1.4–23.5 €/capita in 2013 and 2014. Higher income countries spent more OMPs in absolute terms. Participant countries spent 0.018–0.066% of their GDPs on funding OMPs. Average expenditures on OMPs were ranged between 2.25–6.51% of the public pharmaceutical budget, and 0.44–0.96% of public healthcare expenditures.ConclusionsStandard and special reimbursement techniques play different roles in participant countries. The number of accessible OMPs indicated an equity gap between Eastern and Western Europe. The spending on OMPs as a proportion of GDP, public pharmaceutical and healthcare expenditure was not higher in lower income countries, which indicates substantial differences in patient access to OMPs in favour of higher-income countries.

This disorder is characterized by increased activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is involved in regulating ribosomal biogenesis and translation initiation. We measured the effects of Tsc2 haploinsufficiency (Tsc2+/−) in three month old male mice on regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) by means of the in vivo L-[1-14C]leucine method. This quantitative autoradiographic method includes an estimate of the integrated specific activity of the tracer amino acid in brain tissue. The estimate accounts for recycling of unlabeled amino acids from tissue protein breakdown by means of a factor (λ) that was determined in control and Tsc2+/− mice. The value of λ was higher in Tsc2+/− mice, indicating that a greater fraction of leucine in the tissue precursor pool for protein synthesis is derived from the plasma compared to controls, consistent with reduced rates of protein degradation. We determined rCPS in freely-moving, awake male Tsc2+/− and control mice, and we used the determined values of λ in the calculation of rCPS. Unexpectedly, we found that rCPS were significantly decreased in 16 of the 17 brain regions analyzed in Tsc2+/− mice compared to controls.

306,10.3389/fnins.2017.00248,28579939,"Go to:AbstractSynapses must be preserved throughout an organism's lifespan to allow for normal brain function and behavior. Synapse maintenance is challenging given the long distances between the termini and the cell body, reliance on axonal transport for delivery of newly synthesized presynaptic proteins, and high rates of synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis. Hence, synapses rely on efficient proteostasis mechanisms to preserve their structure and function. To this end, the synaptic compartment has specific chaperones to support its functions. Without proper synaptic chaperone activity, local proteostasis imbalances lead to neurotransmission deficits, dismantling of synapses, and neurodegeneration. In this review, we address the roles of four synaptic chaperones in the maintenance of the nerve terminal, as well as their genetic links to neurodegenerative disease. Three of these are Hsp40 co-chaperones (DNAJs): Cysteine String Protein alpha (CSPα; DNAJC5), auxilin (DNAJC6), and Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis 8 (RME-8; DNAJC13). These co-chaperones contain a conserved J domain through which they form a complex with heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70), enhancing the chaperone's ATPase activity. CSPα is a synaptic vesicle protein known to chaperone the t-SNARE SNAP-25 and the endocytic GTPase dynamin-1, thereby regulating synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis. Auxilin binds assembled clathrin cages, and through its interactions with Hsc70 leads to the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles, a process necessary for the regeneration of synaptic vesicles. RME-8 is a co-chaperone on endosomes and may have a role in clathrin-coated vesicle endocytosis on this organelle. These three co-chaperones maintain client function by preserving folding and assembly to prevent client aggregation, but they do not break down aggregates that have already formed. The fourth synaptic chaperone we will discuss is Heat shock protein 110 (Hsp110), which interacts with Hsc70, DNAJAs, and DNAJBs to constitute a disaggregase. Hsp110-related disaggregase activity is present at the synapse and is known to protect against aggregation of proteins such as α-synuclein. Congruent with their importance in the nervous system, mutations of these co-chaperones lead to familial neurodegenerative disease. CSPα mutations cause adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, while auxilin mutations result in early-onset Parkinson's disease, demonstrating their significance in preservation of the nervous system.Keywords: Hsp110, HSP70, neurodegeneration, proteostasis, synapse maintenance, endocytosis, exocytosis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5437171/

Around 200 of IEMs are potentially treatable through diet, pharmacological and other therapies, if diagnosed earlier in life. IEMs can be diagnosed early through newborn screening (NBS) programs, which are in place in most of the developed countries. However, establishing a NBS in a developing country is a challenging task due to scarcity of disease related data, large population size, poor economy, and burden of other common disorders. Since, not enough data is available for the prevalence of IEMs in Pakistan; therefore, in this study, we set out to find the prevalence of various treatable IEMs in a cohort of intellectually disabled patients suspected for IEMs, which will help us to initiate a NBS program for the most frequent IEMs in Pakistan. Therefore, a total of 429 intellectually disabled (IQ <70) patient samples were collected from Pakistan. A subset of 113 patient samples was selected based on the clinical information for the detailed biochemical screening. Advance analytical techniques like, Amino Acid Analyzer, GC-MS, UHPLC-MS, and MS/MS were used to screen for different treatable IEMs like aminoacidopathies, fatty acid β-oxidation disorders and mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) etc. A total of 14 patients were diagnosed with an IEM i.e., 9 with homocystinuria, 2 with MPS, 2 with Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency and 1 with sitosterolemia. These IEMs are found frequent in the collected patient samples from Pakistan. Thus, present study can help to take an initiative step to start a NBS program in Pakistan, especially for the homocystinuria having highest incidence among aminoacidopathies in the studied patients, and which is amenable to treatment.

Participants completed several subjective measures including self-reported ratings of sedation, stimulation, fatigue and impairment. Blood pressure and pulse rate were recorded repeatedly.ResultsThe acute administration of alcohol increased body sway and the coadministration of energy drinks antagonized this impairment. When participants closed their eyes, alcohol-induced body sway was similar whether or not energy drinks were ingested. While alcohol administration increased ratings of sedation and fatigue, energy drink administration increased ratings of stimulation and reduced ratings of fatigue. Modest increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure following energy drink administration were also observed.ConclusionsVisual assessment of balance impairment is frequently used to indicate that an individual has consumed too much alcohol (e.g., as part of police standardized field sobriety testing or by a bartender assessing when someone should no longer be served more alcohol). The current findings suggest that energy drinks can antagonize alcohol-induced increases in body sway, indicating that future work is needed to determine if this observation regarding neuromotor functioning applies to alcohol in combination with all types of stimulant drugs.Keywords: Alcohol, Energy Drinks, Balance, Motor Control, Blood Pressure",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5750124/

A. baumannii possesses an adaptable physiology, seen not only in its antibiotic resistance and virulence phenotypes but also in its metabolic versatility. In this study, we observed that A. baumannii undergoes global transcriptional changes in response to human pleural fluid (PF), a key host-derived environmental signal. Differential gene expression analyses combined with experimental approaches revealed changes in A. baumannii metabolism, affecting cytotoxicity, persistence, bacterial killing, and chemotaxis. Over 1,220 genes representing 55% of the differentially expressed transcriptomic data corresponded to metabolic processes, including the upregulation of glutamate, short chain fatty acid, and styrene metabolism. We observed an upregulation by 1.83- and 2.61-fold of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex subunits E3 and E2, respectively. We also found that pyruvate (PYR), in conjunction with PF, triggers an A. baumannii pathogenic behavior that adversely impacts human epithelial cell viability. Interestingly, PF also amplified A. baumannii cytotoxicity against murine macrophages, suggesting an immune evasion strategy implemented by A. baumannii. Moreover, we uncovered opposing metabolic strategies dependent on the degree of pathogenicity of the strains, where less pathogenic strains demonstrated greater utilization of PYR to promote persister formation in the presence of PF. Additionally, our transcriptomic analysis and growth studies of A. baumannii suggest the existence of an alternative phenylalanine (PA) catabolic route independent of the phenylacetic acid pathway, which converts PA to phenylpyruvate (PP) and shuttles intermediates into styrene metabolism. This alternative route promoted a neutrophil-evasive state, as PF-induced degradation of PP significantly reduced overall human neutrophil chemotaxis in ex vivo chemotactic assays. Taken together, these data highlight A. baumannii pathoadaptabililty in response to host signals and provide further insight into the role of bacterial metabolism in virulence traits, antibiotic persistence strategies, and host innate immune evasion.Keywords: Acinetobacter baumannii, metabolism, immunoevasion, pleural fluid, pyruvate, phenylalanine, antibiotic resistance",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6650585/

A global, untargeted identification of the metabolic fingerprint may help elucidate the etiology of sIUGR. Umbilical cord blood and placentas collected from 15 pairs of sIUGR monochorionic twins, 24 pairs of uncomplicated twins, and 14 singletons diagnosed with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolomic analyses. Supervised multivariate regression analysis and pathway analysis were performed to compare control twins with sIUGR twins. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was utilized to explore metabolic differences within sIUGR co-twins. Linear logistic regression was applied to screen metabolites that significantly differed in concentration between control twins and sIUGR twins or IUGR singletons. Umbilical cord blood demonstrated better global metabolomic separation of sIUGR and control twins compared to the placenta. Disrupted amino acid and fatty acid metabolism as well as high levels of exposure to environmental xenobiotics were associated with sIUGR. The metabolic abnormalities in MCDA twins suggested that in utero growth discordance is caused by intrauterine and extrauterine environmental factors, rather than genetics.

Synthetic BH4 is used medicinally for BH4-responsive phenylketonuria and inherited BH4 deficiency. BH4 supplementation has also drawn attention as a therapy for various NOS-related cardio-vascular diseases, but its use has met with limited success in decreasing BH2, the oxidized form of BH4. An increase in the BH2/BH4 ratio leads to NOS dysfunction. Previous studies revealed that BH4 supplementation caused a rapid urinary loss of BH4 accompanied by an increase in the blood BH2/BH4 ratio and an involvement of probenecid-sensitive but unknown transporters was strongly suggested in these processes. Here we show that OAT1 and OAT3 enabled cells to take up BP (BH4 and/or BH2) in a probenecid-sensitive manner using rat kidney slices and transporter-expressing cell systems, LLC-PK1 cells and Xenopus oocytes. Both OAT1 and OAT3 preferred BH2 and sepiapterin as their substrate roughly 5- to 10-fold more than BH4. Administration of probenecid acutely reduced the urinary exclusion of endogenous BP accompanied by a rise in blood BP in vivo. These results indicated that OAT1 and OAT3 played crucial roles: (1) in determining baseline levels of blood BP by excluding endogenous BP through the urine, (2) in the rapid distribution to organs of exogenous BH4 and the exclusion to urine of a BH4 excess, particularly when BH4 was administered, and (3) in scavenging blood BH2 by cellular uptake as the gateway to the salvage pathway of BH4, which reduces BH2 back to BH4.Keywords: Tetrahydrobiopterin, Dihydrobiopterin, Biopterin transport, NOS dysfunction, Organic anion transporter, Equilibrative nucleoside transporter",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5632347/

In transient transfection assays, HBV sequences were most active in primary hepatocytes, followed by HBC-3 and ES cells, and became inactive in fibroblasts. Cotransfections with HNF-3 or C/EBP plasmids increased expression of HBV sequences in hepatocytes and HBC-3 cells. However, increased HBV expression was not observed in ES cells and HBV remained inactive in fibroblasts, suggesting different transcriptional controls, which was compatible with alterations in the abundance of endogenous transcription factors.

The primary aim of this study was to demonstrate that analysis of urine samples dried on filter paper by gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS) provides results similar to serum analyzed by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Secondary aims were to show that collection of four samples during the day (4-spot method) can be substituted for a 24-h collection, and that analysis of urine from dried samples is equivalent to liquid urine samples.MethodsThis prospective observational study compared results of urine and serum analyses. Urine samples from women throughout the menstrual cycle and single samples from postmenopausal women were evaluated. Urine was collected onto filter paper and dried. Dried urine was extracted, hydrolyzed, and derivatized prior to analysis by GC–MS/MS. Hormone concentrations were normalized to creatinine. Single samples were used to compare results of 24-h urine collection to the 4-spot method from a separate population of women and men. A subset of these samples were used to compare results from dried urine to liquid urine.ResultsThe primary study showed good reliability in the comparisons between the dried urine and serum assays. During the menstrual cycles of a subset of four women, urine metabolite concentrations followed the same pattern as serum concentrations. Comparison of 4-spot to 24-h urine collections and of dried to liquid urine measurements had intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) greater than 0.95, indicating excellent agreement.ConclusionsFor estradiol and progesterone, the dried urine assay is a good surrogate for serum testing. The 4-spot method can be used instead of 24-h urine collections and dried urine results are comparable to liquid urine. The dried urine assay is useful for some clinical assessments of hormone disorders and may be useful in large epidemiologic studies due to ease of sample handling.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13065-019-0539-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Dried filter paper, DUTCH, Estradiol, GC–MS/MS, Hormone replacement therapy, Pregnanediol, Progesterone, Reproductive hormones, Subfertility",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6661742/

To achieve this, the following gaps need to be addressed: a lack of defined learning objectives for “Bioinformatics for Medical Practitioner” courses, an absence of a structured lesson plan to disseminate the learning objectives, and no defined step-by-step strategy to teach the essentials of bioinformatics in the medical curriculum.ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to address these gaps to design a streamlined pedagogical strategy for teaching basics of bioinformatics in the undergraduate medical curriculum.MethodsThe established instructional design strategies employed in medical education—Gagne’s 9 events of instruction—were followed with further contributions from Peyton’s four-step approach to design a structured lesson plan in bioinformatics.ResultsFirst, we defined the specifics of bioinformatics that a medical student or health care professional should be introduced to use this knowledge in a clinical context. Second, we designed a structured lesson plan using a blended approach from both Gagne’s and Peyton’s instructional models. Lastly, we delineated a step-by-step strategy employing free Web-based bioinformatics module, combining it with a clinical scenario of familial hypercholesterolemia to disseminate the defined specifics of bioinformatics. Implementation of Schon’s reflective practice model indicated that the activity was stimulating for the students with favorable outcomes regarding their basic training in bioinformatics.ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, the present lesson plan is the first that outlines an effective dissemination strategy for integrating introductory bioinformatics into a medical curriculum. Further, the lesson plan blueprint can be used to develop similar skills in workshops, continuing professional development, or continuing medical education events to introduce bioinformatics to practicing physicians.Keywords: bioinformatics, Gagne’s instructional model, genetics, lesson plan, medical education, Peyton’s approach, undergraduate medical education",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6231819/

Underlying reasons of such serious maladies can be summarized as the paucity of appropriate analysis methods and subsequent treatment strategies due to the limited access of centralized and equipped health care facilities for diagnosis. Biosensors hold great impact to turn our current analytical methods into diagnostic strategies by restructuring their sensing module for the detection of biomolecules, especially nano-sized objects such as protein biomarkers and viruses. Unquestionably, current sensing platforms require continuous updates to address growing challenges in the diagnosis of viruses as viruses change quickly and spread largely from person-to-person, indicating the urgency of early diagnosis. Some of the challenges can be classified in biological barriers (specificity, low number of targets, and biological matrices) and technological limitations (detection limit, linear dynamic range, stability, and reliability), as well as economical aspects that limit their implementation into resource-scarce settings. In this review, the principle and types of biosensors and their applications in the diagnosis of distinct infectious diseases were comprehensively explained. The deployment of current biosensors into resource-scarce settings is further discussed for virus detection by elaborating the pros and cons of existing methods as a conclusion and future perspective.Keywords: biosensor, medical applications, virus detection",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6627152/

Therefore, the stable expression of specific inhibitors of E6 and E7 in cancer cells is expected to provide effective treatment for cervical cancer without affecting normal tissue. In this study, we propose a novel therapeutic approach using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against the onco-proteins E6 and E7 (shE6E7) of HPV type 16 (HPV-16), termed AAV-shE6E7. Three different HPV-16-positive cervical cancer cell lines (BOKU, SiHa and SKG-IIIa cells) were tested for gene transfer efficiency using serotypes of AAV vectors. For in vitro analysis, the cells were transduced AAV-shE6E7; alternatively, in vivo studies were performed via the administration of a direct injection of AAV-shE6E7 into cervical cancer cell-derived tumors in mice. The high gene transfer efficiency was observed using AAV2 in all three cervical cancer cell lines. Following transduction, we observed apoptosis, G1 phase arrest and cell growth inhibition. Additionally, in the transduced cells, the E6, E7 and p16 expression levels decreased, whereas the expression levels of p53, p21 and pRb levels were enhanced. The growth of subcutaneously transplanted tumors was markedly inhibited by the single administration of AAV2-shE6E7, and the tumors were almost completely eradicated without any adverse effects. These results provided evidence of the utility of AAV2-shE6E7 as a novel treatment approach for cervical cancer.Keywords: cervical cancer, adeno-associated virus vector, short hairpin RNA, human papillomavirus, E6, E7, p53, Rb, apoptosis, gene transfer efficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5807046/

The era of high-throughput technologies promises to accelerate its scale dramatically. Genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, glycomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics offer an amazing opportunity for holistic investigation and contextual pathophysiologic understanding of inherited metabolic diseases for precise diagnosis and tailored treatment. While each of the -omics technologies is important to systems biology, some are more mature than others. Exome sequencing is emerging as a reimbursed test in clinics around the world, and untargeted metabolomics has the potential to serve as a single biochemical testing platform. The challenge lies in the integration and cautious interpretation of these big data, with translation into clinically meaningful information and/or action for our patients. A daunting but exciting task for the clinician; we provide clinical cases to illustrate the importance of his/her role as the connector between physicians, laboratory experts and researchers in the basic, computer, and clinical sciences. Open collaborations, data sharing, functional assays, and model organisms play a key role in the validation of -omics discoveries. Having all the right expertise at the table when discussing the diagnostic approach and individualized management plan according to the information yielded by -omics investigations (e.g., actionable mutations, novel therapeutic interventions), is the stepping stone of P4 medicine.

This review aims to provide a comprehensive survey of recently published literature on ASD and especially novel insights into excitatory synaptic transmission. Even though numerous genes have been discovered that play roles in ASD, a good understanding of the pathophysiologic process of ASD is still lacking. The protein–protein interactions between the products of NLGN, SHANK, and NRXN synaptic genes indicate that the dysfunction in synaptic plasticity could be one reason for the development of ASD. Designing more accurate diagnostic tests for the early diagnosis of ASD would improve treatment strategies and could enhance the appropriate monitoring of prognosis. This comprehensive review describes the psychotropic and antiepileptic drugs that are currently available as effective pharmacological treatments and provides in-depth knowledge on the concepts related to clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and genetic perspectives of ASD. An increase in the prevalence of ASD in Gulf Cooperation Council countries is also addressed in the review.

This study aimed to determine the incidence rates of OAs, FAODs, and AAs in Asian countries and Germany using selective screening and ENBS records.Materials and methodsSelective screening for IMDs using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and MS/MS was performed among patients suspected to be afflicted in Asian countries (including Japan, Vietnam, China, and India) between 2000 and 2015, and the results from different countries were compared. Similarly, ENBS results from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Germany were compared. Additionally, the results of selective screening and ENBS in Japan were compared.ResultsAmong 39,270 patients who underwent selective screening, IMDs were detected in 1170. Methylmalonic acidemia was frequently identified in several countries, including Japan (81/377 diagnosed IMDs), China (94/216 IMDs), and India (72/293 IMDs). In Vietnam, however, β-ketothiolase deficiency was particularly frequent (33/250 IMDs). ENBS yielded differences in overall IMD rates by country: 1:8557 in Japan, 1:7030 in Taiwan, 1:13,205 in South Korea, and 1:2200 in Germany. Frequently discovered diseases included propionic acidemia (PPA) and phenylketonuria (PKU) in Japan, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (MCCD) and PKU in Taiwan, MCCD and citrullinemia type I in South Korea, and PKU and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in Germany. Furthermore, in Japan, selective screening and ENBS yielded respective PPA frequencies of 14.7% and 49.4% among all organic acidemias.ConclusionThe incidence rates of IMDs vary by country.

Existing diagnostic methods focus on behavioral and performance characteristics, which complicates the diagnosis of patients younger than 3 years-old. The purpose of this study is to characterize metabolic features of ASD that could be used to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis and exploration of ASD etiology. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to evaluate major metabolic fluctuations in 76 organic acids present in urine from 156 children with ASD and from 64 non-autistic children. Three algorithms, Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were used to develop models to distinguish ASD from typically developing (TD) children and to detect potential biomarkers. In an independent testing set, full model of XGBoost with all 76 acids achieved an AUR of 0.94, while reduced model with top 20 acids discovered by voting from these three algorithms achieved 0.93 and represent a good collection of potential ASD biomarkers. In summary, urine organic acids detection with GC/MS combined with XGBoost algorithm could represent a novel and accurate strategy for diagnosis of autism and the discovered potential biomarkers could be valuable for future research on the pathogenesis of autism and possible interventions.Keywords: autism spectrum disorder, biomarker, urine organic acids, Chinese, metabolomics, diagnosis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502994/

Selected approaches are presented, starting from currently used technologies (next-generation sequencing (NGS) and microarrays), followed by newer options (reverse phenotyping). Next, we describe an old concept in a new light (endophenotypes), subsequently coming up with a sophisticated and complex approach (gene networks) ending by a nascent field (computational psychiatry). The challenges and barriers that exist to translate genomic research to real-world patient assessment are further discussed. We emphasize the view that only a paradigm shift can bring a fundamental change in psychiatric practice, allowing to disentangle the intricacies of mental diseases. All the diagnostic methods, as described, are directed at uncovering the integrity of the system including many types of relations within a complex structure. The integrative system approach offers new opportunity to connect genetic background with specific diseases entities, or concurrently, with symptoms regardless of a diagnosis.

This led to variable advice being given to patients.MethodologyIn 2015, British Inherited Metabolic Disease Group (BIMDG) dietitians (n = 70) were sent a multiple-choice questionnaire on the interpretation of protein from food-labels and the allocation of different foods. Based on majority responses, 16 statements were developed. Over 18-months, using Delphi methodology, these statements were systematically reviewed and refined with a facilitator recording discussion until a clear majority was attained for each statement. In Phase 2 and 3 a further 7 statements were added.ResultsThe statements incorporated controversial dietary topics including: a practical ‘scale’ for guiding calculation of protein from food-labels; a general definition for exchange-free foods; and guidance for specific foods. Responses were divided into paediatric and adult groups. Initially, there was majority consensus (≥86%) by paediatric dietitians (n = 29) for 14 of 16 statements; a further 2 structured discussions were required for 2 statements, with a final majority consensus of 72% (n = 26/36) and 64% (n = 16/25). In adult practice, 75% of dietitians agreed with all initial statements for adult patients and 40% advocated separate maternal-PKU guidelines. In Phase 2, 5 of 6 statements were agreed by ≥76% of respondents with one statement requiring a further round of discussion resulting in 2 agreed statements with a consensus of ≥71% by dietitians in both paediatric and adult practice. In Phase 3 one statement was added to elaborate further on an initial statement, and this received 94% acceptance by respondents. Statements were endorsed by the UK National Society for PKU.ConclusionsThe BIMDG dietitians group have developed consensus dietetic statements that aim to harmonise dietary advice given to patients with PKU across the UK, but monitoring of statement adherence by health professionals and patients is required.Keywords: Phenylketonuria (PKU), Delphi method, Food labelling, Consensus, Phenylalanine exchanges",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6318866/

In this study, we present a new way to map the literature landscape, focusing on nutrition-based lifestyle interventions to promote healthy cognitive ageing. We applied a combination of citation network analysis and text mining to map out the existing literature on nutritional interventions and cognitive health. Results indicated five overarching clusters of publications, which could be further deconstructed into a total of 35 clusters. These could be broadly distinguished by the focus on lifespan stages (e.g., infancy versus older age), and specificity regarding nutrition (e.g., a narrow focus on iodine deficiency versus a broad focus on weight gain).

Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of co-occurring NDDs that affect between 3% and 5% of the world population, thus presenting a great challenge to society. This problem calls for the need to understand the pathobiology of these disorders and to design new therapeutic strategies. One approach towards this has been the development of multiple analogous mouse models. This review discusses studies conducted in the mouse models of five major monogenic causes of ID and ASDs: Fmr1, Syngap1, Mecp2, Shank2/3 and Neuroligins/Neurnexins. These studies reveal that, despite having a diverse molecular origin, the effects of these mutations converge onto similar or related aetiological pathways, consequently giving rise to the typical phenotype of cognitive, social and emotional deficits that are characteristic of ID and ASDs. This convergence, therefore, highlights common pathological nodes that can be targeted for therapy. Other than conventional therapeutic strategies such as non-pharmacological corrective methods and symptomatic alleviation, multiple studies in mouse models have successfully proved the possibility of pharmacological and genetic therapy enabling functional recovery.Keywords: autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, SYNGAP1, fragile X mental retardation protein, MECP2, NEUROLIGIN",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6597757/

During phase 2, participants underwent a 2-week training period to facilitate associative learning between the sensory properties of test loads and their post-ingestive effects. In phase 3, participants were retested for their cephalic phase responses as in phase 1.Participants were classified as responders if they demonstrated a positive insulin response (rise of serum insulin above baseline i.e. Δ insulin) 2 minutes post-stimulus in phase 1. Among responders exposed to the same sweetener in Phases 1 and 3, the proportion of participants that displayed a rise of insulin with oral exposure to sucralose was significantly greater when the stimulus was in the solid form compared to the beverage form. Sucralose and sucrose exposure elicited similarly significant increases in serum insulin 2 minutes after exposure and significant decreases after 2 minutes in responders in both food forms. The solid food form elicited greater CPIR over 2, 6 and 10 minutes than the beverage form. There was no effect of learning on insulin responses after training. The results indicate the presence of a significant CPIR in a subset of individuals with overweight or obesity after oral exposure to sucralose, especially when present in solid food form.

We used county as the unit of randomization (a total of 10 counties), with half of the counties randomly allocated to the intervention arm (with maternal education material adapted from the World Health Organization being delivered by text messaging to village health workers and pregnant women alike) and the other half to the control arm (normal care without text messaging). Data on maternal and infant health outcomes and health behaviors were collected and compared between the 2 arms, with maternal and perinatal mortality as the primary outcomes.ResultsA total of 13,937 pregnant women completed the follow-up and were included in the final analysis. Among them, 6771 were allocated to the intervention arm and 6966 were allocated to the control arm. At the county level, the mean (SD) of maternal mortality and perinatal mortality rate were 0.0% (0.1) and 1.3% (0.6), respectively, in the intervention arm and 0.1% (0.2) and 1.5% (0.4), respectively, in the control arm.

The cblA type of MMA is very rare in China. This study aimed to describe the biochemical, clinical, and genetic characteristics of two siblings in a Chinese family, suspected of having the cblA-type of MMA.MethodsThe Chinese family of Han ethnicity of two siblings with the cblA-type of MMA, was enrolled. Target-exome sequencing was performed for a panel of MMA-related genes to detect causative mutations. The influence of an identified missense variant on the protein’s structure and function was analysed using SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PROVEAN, and MutationTaster software. Moreover, homology modelling of the human wild-type and mutant proteins was performed using SWISSMODEL to evaluate the variant.ResultsThe proband was identified via newborn screening (NBS); whereas, her elder brother, who had not undergone expanded NBS, was diagnosed later through genetic family screening. The younger sibling exhibited abnormal biochemical manifestations, and the clinical performance was relatively good after treatment, while the older brother had a mild biochemical and clinical phenotype, mainly featuring poor academic performance. A novel, homozygous missense c.365T>C variant in exon 2 of their MMAA genes was identified using next-generation sequencing and validated by Sanger sequencing. Several different types of bioinformatics software predicted that the novel variant c.365T>C (p.L122P) was deleterious. Furthermore, three-dimensional crystal structure analysis revealed that replacement of Leu122 with Pro122 led to the loss of two intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the residue at position 122 and Leu188 and Ala119, resulting in instability of the MMAA protein structure.ConclusionsThe two siblings suspected of having the cblA-type of MMA showed mild phenotypes during follow-up, and a novel, homozygous missense variant in their MMAA genes was identified. We believe that the clinical features of the two siblings were associated with the MMAA c.365T>C variant; however, further functional studies are warranted to confirm the variant’s pathogenicity.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12881-018-0635-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Isolated methylmalonic aciduria, Novel variant, MMAA gene, Next-generation sequencing",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6042273/

In contrast, the fate of hepatic transgene expression between sexes is not fully understood. Here we studied whether sex hormones changed hepatic transgene expression in the ubiquitous CAG promoter-driven lacZ transgenic (Tg) rat. Both sexes of CAG-lacZ Tg rats received gonadectomy. Liver biopsy was taken weekly to determine the change of transgene expression. Histological result of adult males showed mosaic lacZ expression but it was negative in adult females, while livers in neonatal stage showed comparable expression of lacZ. Other organs exhibited equal expression in both sexes. At 2 weeks after castration, lacZ expression in male liver was significantly decreased and became negative after 4 weeks while no significant difference was observed in the lacZ expression pattern in other organs. After ovariectomy, lacZ expression in female liver remained undetectable. Moreover, testosterone treatment to gonadectomized rats of both sexes could enhance lacZ expression in the liver. In summary, we report that CAG-lacZ Tg rats demonstrate sexual dimorphism of transgene expression specifically only in the liver. Testosterone administration mediated upregulation of liver lacZ expression. Our findings suggested that androgen, especially testosterone, plays an important role in the hepatic transgene expression.Key words: Transgene expression, lacZ, CAG promoter, Testosterone, Gonadectomy",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6009120/

A total of 18 patients were studied: 14 with autosomal dominant and recessive guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-I deficiency; 3 with sepiapterin reductase deficiency; and 1 with aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Further 11 patients were studied after receiving serotoninergic treatment (serotonin precursors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors): 5 with aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency; 1 with sepiapterin reductase deficiency; 3 with dihydropteridine reductase deficiency; and 2 with 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase deficiency. Among the patients without therapy, 6 presented low urinary sulphatoxymelatonin values, while most of the patients with guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-I deficiency showed normal values. 5 of 11 patients under treatment presented low urine sulphatoxymelatonin values. Thus, decreased excretion of sulphatoxymelatonin is frequently observed in cases with severe genetic disorders affecting serotonin biosynthesis.

To control transgene transcription, the regulatory system GeneSwitch (GS) was evaluated in detail both in vitro and in vivo. The classical two-plasmid mifepristone (MFP)-inducible GS system was put into one plasmid or a single AAV5 vector. Our data demonstrate the inducibility of multiple transgenes and the importance of promoter and regulatory elements within the GS system. Mice injected with AAV5 containing the GS system transiently expressed mRNA and protein after MFP induction. The inducer MFP could be measured in plasma and liver tissue, and assessment of MFP and its metabolites showed rapid clearance from murine plasma. In a head-to-head comparison, our single vector outclassed the classical two-vector GS system. Finally, we show repeated inducibility of the transgene that also translated into a dynamic phenotypic change in mice.

Urine samples (100 µl, containing 2.5 mmol/l creatinine) were taken from patients with IMDs. The collected urine was then treated using a two-step derivatization method (with oximation and silylation at room temperature), where urea and protein were removed. In the first step of the derivatization, α-ketoacids and α-aldehyde acids were prepared by oximation using novel oximation reagents. The second-step of the derivatization was that residues were silylated for analysis. Urine samples were examined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and a retention time-locking technique. The simultaneous analysis and identification of >400 metabolites in >130 types of IMD was possible from the GC/MS results, where the IMDs included phenylketonuria, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency, β-ureidopropionase deficiency and mitochondrial metabolic disorders. This method was demonstrated to have good repeatability. Considering α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) as an example, the relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the α-KG retention time and peak area were 0.8 and 3.9%, respectively, the blank spiked recovery rate was between 89.6 and 99.8%, and the RSD was ≤7.5% (n=5). The method facilitates the analysis of thermally non-stable and semi-volatile metabolites in urine, and greatly expands the range of materials that can be synchronously screened by GC/MS.

Methods: An exonic sequence derived from a hypothetical male patient was matched against human reference data using a genome browser. The missense mutation was identified by running BlastX, and information on the affected protein was retrieved from the database UniProt. The pathogenic nature of the mutation was assessed with PolyPhen-2. Disease-specific databases were used to assess whether the missense mutation led to a severe phenotype, and whether pharmacological therapy was an option. Results: An inexpensive bioinformatics approach is presented to get the reader acquainted with the diagnosis of Fabry disease.

For assessment of a condition, there was unanimous support for a robust process based on criteria. While the need to assess harms and benefits was a repeated theme in the articles, there is no agreed-upon threshold for benefit in decision-making. Furthermore, the literature was consistent in its recommendation for an overarching, independent, multidisciplinary group providing recommendations to government.

Pleiotropy has major implications for evolution, development, ageing, and disease. Except for disease data, pleiotropy is almost exclusively estimated from full gene knockouts. However, most deleterious alleles segregating in natural populations do not fully abolish gene function, and the degree to which a polymorphism reduces protein function may influence the number of traits it affects. Utilizing genome-scale metabolic models for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that most fitness-reducing full gene knockouts of metabolic genes in these fast-growing microbes have pleiotropic effects, i.e., they compromise the production of multiple biomass components. Alleles of the same metabolic enzyme-encoding gene with increasingly reduced enzymatic function typically affect an increasing number of biomass components. This increasing pleiotropy is often mediated through effects on the generation of currency metabolites such as ATP or NADPH. We conclude that the physiological effects observed in full gene knockouts of metabolic genes will in most cases not be representative for alleles with only partially reduced enzyme capacity or expression level.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6250661/

The recessive form presents with complex neurological and autonomic dysfunction whilst the dominant form presents as Dopa-responsive dystonia.Case presentationWe describe a South Asian child who initially presented with neurological dysfunction and recurrent vomiting and later developed recurrent hyperthermia for several months. The child did not have screening for hyperphenylalaninemia at birth and was found to have marked hyperphenylalaninemia after clinical presentation at 5 months. Further evaluation revealed BH4 deficiency.

Simply comprehending the dizzying amounts of predictive information about the health and traits of future children will overwhelm future parents. But trying to choose embryos with the ‘best’ combination of genetic variants could be paralyzing. Nevertheless, numerous pressures will make this technology alluring, compelling providers to develop remedies to assist future parents with these difficult reproductive decisions. The remedies, however, will create their own challenges. Some might test the limits of reproductive autonomy and heighten social inequities. A particularly vexing remedy would be the development of algorithms for embryo selection, which could routinize reproductive decisions, reduce societal diversity, exacerbate ‘choice overload’ effects, challenge professional norms, and raise the specter of eugenics.

Animal studies have provided proof-of-concept that enzyme replacement therapy could represent a long-term therapeutic option. The characterization of neuronal stem cells (NSCs) derived from aldehyde dehydrogenase 5a1−/− (aldh5a1−/−) mice, the murine model of SSADHD, has highlighted NSC utility as an in vitro system in which to study therapeutics and associated toxicological properties. Gene expression analyses have revealed that transcripts encoding GABAA receptors are down-regulated and may remain largely immature in aldh5a1−/− brain, characterized by excitatory as opposed to inhibitory outputs, the latter being the expected action in the mature central nervous system. This indicates that agents altering chloride channel activity may be therapeutically relevant in SSADHD.

No patient-reported outcome (PRO) HRQoL measure has been validated for use in an AL amyloidosis patient population, leaving a gap for researchers conducting observational studies and clinical trials for drug development. The SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36) has been the most frequently used PRO in AL amyloidosis studies to date, and early qualitative validation studies support its use in this population. The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the SF-36 among patients with AL amyloidosis.MethodsData from community-based (n=341) and clinic-based (n=1,438) observational studies were used to document the psychometric properties of the SF-36 in this disease population. Reliability was estimated using internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation). Convergent validity, known-groups validity, and the ability to detect change were assessed with available criterion variables.ResultsScale reliability (Cronbach’s alpha ≥0.780 for all scores) and test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients ≥0.731 for all) were acceptable. Scale convergent validity was supported by strong correlations with conceptually related measures. Mean SF-36 scores varied by response to treatment (P<0.05 for all scores) and a self-reported measure of disease severity (P<0.001 for all scores). Data indicate that the SF-36 is sensitive to changes in other measures over time.ConclusionThis study provided clear and consistent evidence of the psychometric properties of the SF-36 in both community-based and clinic-based samples of patients with AL amyloidosis.Keywords: patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, psychometric properties",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5724409/

However, the specially designed low protein products/medical foods - which are one of the important treatment tools - were not available up until several years ago in Saudi Arabia (SA). Our aim was to measure the compliance and quality of life in patients affected with these disorders followed in the metabolic nutrition clinic at King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, SA.MethodologyWe used a non-randomized retrospective/prospective study which utilized the growth parameters, biochemical data of patients plus questionnaires collected from patients and their family/caregivers. A total of n = 182 patients affected with selected amino acid metabolism disorders were enrolled. Some were excluded n = 84 for various reasons. Sample analyzed were: Phenylketonuria (PKU) (44), Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) (30), Tyrosinemia (TYR) (17) and Homocystinuria (HCU) (7). Tandem Mass Spectrometry (TMS) used to quantitate plasma amino acid concentrations. Data was obtained using (COMPLE) Microsoft-Access which was designed by the metabolic nutrition clinic at KFSH&RC-Riyadh. Student's paired t-test was used to investigate relationship between variables.ResultsThe main findings were the improvement of selected amino acid levels pre and post the usage of medical foods. In PKU patients, the TMS Phenylalanine (PHE) levels post usage was significantly decreased (P value < .0001). This was also the case in MSUD patients with significant decrease in Leucine & Isoleucine levels (P value .0008) but not in Valine levels (P value .1148) as 36.7% of them received Valine supplements while enrolled in the study.ConclusionLow protein products availability was successful in improving outcomes for selected amino acid metabolic disorders.

Clinical symptoms can vary from a severe life-threatening condition to an asymptomatic state, reported in the majority of cases. Since the expansion of newborn screenings, more than three hundred probands were admitted for molecular-genetic analysis, most selected because of elevated values of C4-acylcarnitine detected in newborn screenings in Slovakia. Searching for the principal genomic changes led us to the selection of sixty-two patients in whom the presence of sequence variants in the ACADS gene was analysed and correlated with the available biochemical and clinical data.MethodsBiochemical and molecular genetic tests were performed. Acylcarnitine profiles focused on an elevated level of C4-acylcarnitine, which was analysed via tandem mass spectrometry. Urinary organic acids, specifically a quantity of ethylmalonic acid, were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The entire coding region of the ACADS gene was sequenced. A low-cost restriction fragment length polymorphism of PCR amplified fragments analysis (PCR-RFLP) of pathogenic variants was introduced and implemented for the molecular-genetic algorithm appropriate for the Slovak population.ResultsOur molecular genetic study was performed on sixty-two patients with a pathological biochemical pattern related to short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. In this cohort, we discovered a high occurrence of two rare pathogenic variants—the deletion c.310_312delGAG and the substitution c.1138C>T, with allelic frequencies of 64% and 31%, respectively. Up to 86% of investigated individuals belong to the Roma ethnic group.ConclusionsAnalogous to other countries, SCADD is not included in the newborn screening programme. Based on the exceeded levels of the specific biomarker C4-acylcarnitine as well as ethylmalonic acid, we revealed a high prevalence of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency cases, confirmed by the findings of two rare pathogenic variants. A deletion c.310_312delGAG and c.1138C > T substitution in the ACADS gene appear with a high frequency in the Roma ethnic group of Slovakia. Due to the uncertainty of the pathogenicity and clinical consequences, it is important to follow up the morbidity and mortality in these patients over time and evaluate SCADD in relation to clinical outcomes and preventive healthcare recommendations.Keywords: Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, Newborn screening, C4-acylcarnitine, Ethylmalonic acid, Frequent pathogenic variants in Slovakia, Roma ethnic group",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5910552/

These conditions arise due to the abnormal development of an embryo's normal structures.AIMS:A case–control study was conducted to investigate the determinant factors leading to CHD.MATERIALS AND METHODS:All newborns who have been diagnosed with CHD upon echocardiography in 2013 were considered as cases. The number of samples required was randomly selected from the newborns who lacked CHD on cardiography. The mothers of both groups were handed the questionnaires.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED:SPSS 23 was employed to analyze the data.RESULTS:A statistically significant association was seen between CHD and a positive family history (FH) (P < 0.001), consanguinity (P < 0.001), maternal diabetes (P = 0.004), the use of antiepileptics during the first 45 days of gestation (P = 0.002), and the mother's education status (P > 0.001).

Congenital microcephaly is present at birth, whereas postnatal microcephaly occurs later in life. Genetic abnormalities, syndromes, metabolic disorders, teratogens, infections, prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal injuries can cause both congenital and postnatal microcephaly. Evaluation of patients with microcephaly begins with a thorough history and physical examination. In cases of worsening microcephaly or neurological signs or symptoms, neuroimaging, metabolic, or genetic testing should be strongly considered. Any further studies and workup should be directed by the presence of signs or symptoms pointing to an underlying diagnosis and are usually used as confirmatory testing for certain conditions. Neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often the first diagnostic test in evaluating children with microcephaly. Genetic testing is becoming more common and is often the next step following neuroimaging when there is no specific evidence in the history or physical examination suggesting a diagnosis. Microcephaly is a lifelong condition with no known cure. The prognosis is usually worse for children who experienced an intrauterine infection or have a chromosomal or metabolic abnormality.

Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is one form of PID which is uniformly fatal without early, definitive therapy, and outcomes are significantly improved if infants are diagnosed and treated within the first few months of life. Screening for SCID using T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis has been introduced in many countries worldwide. The utility of additional screening with kappa recombining excision circles (KREC) has also been described, enabling identification of infants with severe forms of PID manifested by T and B cell lymphopenia.

The differential diagnosis of IEM associated with hyperglycaemic ketoacidosis and diabetes include: organic acidemias specifically propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, isovaleric acidemia, hereditary hemochromatosis, aceruloplasminemia, holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency, β-ketothiolase deficiency and finally, cystinosis, Rogers syndrome (thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia) and congenital disorders of glycosylation type Ia.

We identified all orphan drugs that were authorized until August 1, 2017. European Public Assessment Reports were used to extract the final dose used in the summary of product characteristics, involvement of healthy volunteers, study type, end points used, number of patients, number of doses, studies in special populations, and dose used for phase 3 studies. Each drug was checked for major objections and dose changes postmarketing. We included 49 orphan drugs, of which 28 were indicated for metabolic disorders and 21 for oncologic indications. Dose‐finding studies were performed in 32 orphan drugs, and studies in healthy volunteers in 26. The absence of dose‐finding studies was mostly due to the rarity of the disease. In this case the dose was determined based on factors such as animal studies or clinical experience. Dose‐related major objections were raised for 9 orphan drugs. Postmarketing dose‐finding studies were conducted in 18 orphan drugs, but dose changes were applied in only 2 drugs. In conclusion, dose‐finding studies in the case of metabolic and oncologic orphan drugs were conducted in the development programs of two thirds of orphan drugs.

We identified three hit compounds which show the ability to increase the thermal stability of both the C-terminal domain as well as full-length NPM. The best hit also seemed to favor folding of an AML-like mutant. Computational pocket identification and molecular docking support a stabilization mechanism based on binding of the phenyl/benzene group of the compounds to a particular hydrophobic pocket and additional polar interactions with solvent-accessible residues. Since these results indicate a chaperoning potential of our candidate hits, we tested their effect on the subcellular localization of AML-like mutants.

NBS Connect was launched in 2012 by Emory University after years of planning and grassroots work by professionals, consumers, and industry. Individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) or tyrosinemia (TYR) have been recruited through distribution of outreach materials, presentations at parent organization meetings and direct recruitment at clinic appointments. Participants complete online profiles generating data on diagnosis, treatment, symptoms, outcomes, barriers to care, and quality of life. Resources such as education materials, information on the latest research and clinical trials, recipes, interactive health tracking systems, and professional support tools are described. In addition, to examine the ability of NBS Connect to generate data that guides hypothesis-driven research, data pertaining to age at diagnosis, bone health, and skin conditions in individuals with PKU were assessed. The objective of this paper is to describe the development of NBS Connect and highlight its data, resources and research contributions.ResultsIn September 2016, NBS Connect had 442 registered participants: 314 (71%) individuals with PKU, 68 (15%) with MSUD, 20 (5%) with TYR, and 40 (9%) with other disorders on the NBS panel. Age at diagnosis was less than 4 weeks in 285 (89%) of 319 respondents to this question and between 1 month and 14 years in 29 (9%) individuals. Of 216 respondents with PKU, 33 (15%) had a DXA scan in the past year. Of 217 respondents with PKU, 99 (46%) reported at least one skin condition.ConclusionsNBS Connect was built and refined with feedback from all stakeholders, including individuals with inherited metabolic disorders. Based on patient-reported data, future studies can be initiated to test hypotheses such as the relationship between PKU and skin conditions. Patient registries like NBS Connect can inform hypothesis-driven research, contributing to knowledge generation and following the current trend in moving from traditional medicine towards evidence-based practice.

Germany set up a NAP in 2013 suggesting a three-tiered structure of co-operating centers (CC), centers of excellence (CE) and reference centers (CR). Since then CEs and CRs were organized in the framework of university hospitals. However, realization of CCs taking into account the requirements of the NAP has been slow. We therefore set-up a 12-months program to initiate co-operation and to support the development of structured CCs.MethodsOur center invited 3000 physicians from Berlin and/or Brandenburg to participate. They were chosen either due to already referring patients with rare metabolic diseases to the center, residing in a neighborhood with diverse ethnic background, known to have a high prevalence for specific metabolic diseases, or working as a medical sub-specialist (gastroenterology, hematology, rheumatology) with a high probability to diagnose a rare metabolic disease. The center offered co-operation contracts, administrative and structured medical support, privileged access to the center for physicians and their patients, as well as a program of continuous medical education (CME) over a period of 12 months.ResultsBetween 0.1 to 0.5% (mean 0.2%) of the invited physicians participated in CME meetings. None of them was interested in setting up a co-operating center. The physicians were interested in broadening their knowledge about rare diseases, but less so in direct care for these patients and not at all in fulfilling the requirements of the NAP.ConclusionsThe requirements of the NAP for CC are thought of as unrealistic due to their demands on structural re-organization, quality measurements and additional work-load for outpatient-care. Especially so, with respect for the low number of patients profiting from these efforts and the lack of re-imbursement. We suggest a reconsideration of the German NAP.Keywords: Rare diseases, National action plan, Co-operation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6598233/

Genome editing tools are necessary for the construction of strains for new applications and products, but can also play a crucial role in traditional ones, such as food and probiotics, as a research tool for gaining mechanistic insights and discovering new properties. Traditionally, recombinant DNA techniques for LAB have strongly focused on being food-grade, but they lack speed and the number of genetically tractable strains is still rather limited. Further tool development will enable rapid construction of multiple mutants or mutant libraries on a genomic level in a wide variety of LAB strains.

In this way, evolution inextricably linked diet to all major physiological systems including the nervous system. The importance of diet in neurological development is well documented, although the mechanisms by which diet-derived signaling molecules (DSMs) affect cognition are poorly understood. Studies on the positive impact of nutritive and non-nutritive bioactive molecules on brain function are encouraging but lack the statistical power needed to demonstrate strong positive associations. Establishing associations between DSMs and cognitive functions like mood, memory and learning are made even more difficult by the lack of robust phenotypic markers that can be used to accurately and reproducibly measure the effects of DSMs. Lastly, it is now apparent that processes like neurogenesis and neuroplasticity are embedded within layers of interlocked signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks. Within these interdependent pathways and networks, the various transducers of DSMs are used combinatorially to produce those emergent adaptive gene expression responses needed for stimulus-induced neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Taken together, it appears that cognition is encoded genomically and modified by epigenetics and epitranscriptomics to produce complex transcriptional programs that are exquisitely sensitive to signaling molecules from the environment. Models for how DSMs mediate the interplay between the environment and various neuronal processes are discussed in the context of the food–brain axis.Subject terms: Neuroscience, Systems biology, Dendritic excitability",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6548416/

Here, the combination of constitutive CreER expression together with inducible expression of a transgene or miR-shRNA of choice is presented as an example of this technique. We cover the multi-step procedure starting from the preparation of sleeping beauty-transposon constructs, to the injection and treatment of mice, and the preparation of liver tissue for analysis by immunostaining. The system presented is a reliable and efficient approach to achieve complex genetic manipulations in hepatocytes.

Overproduction of these reactive species or failure to maintain their levels within the physiological range results in cellular redox dysfunction, often termed cellular oxidative stress. Redox dysfunction in turn is at the molecular basis of disease etiology and progression. Accordingly, antioxidant intervention to restore redox homeostasis has been pursued as a therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders among many others. Despite preliminary success in cellular and animal models, redox-based interventions have virtually been ineffective in clinical trials. We propose the fundamental reason for their failure is a flawed delivery approach. Namely, systemic delivery for a geographically local disease limits the effectiveness of the antioxidant. We take a critical look at the literature and evaluate successful and unsuccessful approaches to translation of redox intervention to the clinical arena, including dose, patient selection, and delivery approach. We argue that when interpreting a failed antioxidant-based clinical trial, it is crucial to take into account these variables and importantly, whether the drug had an effect on the redox status. Finally, we propose that local and targeted delivery hold promise to translate redox-based therapies from the bench to the bedside.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5832094/

A meta‐analysis of observational studies was performed to address the question of whether women who had a history of viral infection in early pregnancy were at an increased risk of CHD in offspring, compared with mothers without viral infection.Methods and ResultsUnrestricted searches were conducted, with an end date parameter of July 15, 2018, of PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Libraries, and Chinese databases, to identify studies that met prestated inclusion criteria. Seventeen case‐control studies involving 67 233 women were included for analysis. Both fixed‐effects models (odds ratio [OR], 1.83; 95% CI, 1.58–2.12; P<0.0001) and random‐effects models (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.54–3.36; P<0.0001) suggested that mothers who had a history of viral infection in early pregnancy experienced a significantly increased risk of developing CHD in offspring. For specific viral infections, the risk of developing CHD in offspring was significantly increased among mothers with rubella virus (OR, 3.49, 95% CI, 2.39–5.11 in fixed‐effects models; and OR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.75–7.15 in random‐effects models) and cytomegalovirus (OR, 3.95; 95% CI, 1.87–8.36 in fixed‐effects models) in early pregnancy; however, other maternal viral infections in early pregnancy were not significantly associated with risk of CHD in offspring.

This work examines the potential of Protein Saver 903 cards for the storage and transport of SLA-stimulated dried plasma spot samples. Blood was collected from asymptomatic and negative control subjects living in a Leishmania infantum- (Spain) and Leishmania donovani-endemic area (Bangladesh). After SLA-stimulation, three types of sample were prepared: frozen liquid plasma (−20 °C), and plasma dropped onto Protein Saver cards kept at −20 °C (DPS-FZ), and at ambient temperature (DPS-AT). The concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-2, CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL2 and CXCL8 in the thawed liquid plasma (TLP), DPS-FZ and DPS-AT samples were then determined. Strong correlations were seen between the TLP and DPS-FZ/AT samples for all the studied cytokines/chemokines in both the L. infantum and L. donovani areas. Protein Saver 903 cards would therefore appear to allow for the transport of SLA-stimulated plasma samples by courier at ambient temperature. The CXCL10 and CXCL9 detectable in these plasma spots provided robust markers for identifying asymptomatic subjects from both endemic areas.

Dried blood spots (DBS) have been demonstrated to be a good tool for collecting, storing and transporting clinical specimens from rural areas and limited-resource settings to laboratory facilities, where viral infections can be more reliably diagnosed.Methods:The seroprevalence and virological characterization of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as human retroviruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 [HTLV-1] and human T-cell leukaemia virus type 2 [HTLV-2]), were investigated in clinical specimens collected from DBS in Ghana.Results:A total of 305 consecutive DBS were collected. A high prevalence of chronic HBV (8.5%) and occult hepatitis B (14.2%) was found, whereas rates were lower for HIV-1, HTLV-1 and HCV (3.2%, 1.3% and 0.6%, respectively). HIV-2 and HTLV-2 were absent. CRF02_AG was the predominant HIV-1 subtype, whereas genotype E was the most frequent HBV variant.Conclusions:DBS are helpful in the diagnosis and virological characterization of hepatitis and retrovirus infections in resource-limited settings. The high rate of hepatitis B in Ghana, either overt or occult, is noteworthy and confirms recent findings from other sub-Saharan countries.

Compared to dried blood spot samples analyzed by accurate stable isotope dilution assays (SIDAs), the new technique could provide further substantial miniaturizing of folate assays by eliminating hematocrit effects and uneven analyte distribution within the sample. Herein, we present a miniaturized SIDA coupled with LC-MS/MS measurement of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid as main folate vitamer in whole blood (WB) using [13C5]-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid as internal standard. Elution and extraction of only 10.8 μL-dried WB were carried out by centrifugation followed by enzymatic treatment for polyglutamate deconjugation. Matrix separation was achieved by heating and centrifugation. To verify applicability, WB folate status of 11 volunteers was screened. Limits of detection and limits of quantitation were 9 and 26 nmol·L−1, respectively, which is sufficiently low for screening folate status. Recoveries were 97 (±5.8), 99 (±2.8), and 96 (±6.1)% for 800, 400, and 200 nmol L−1 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, respectively. Precision of the LC-MS/MS instrument and inter-assay precision trials revealed CVs of 8.1 and 3.5% (294 nmol L−1), respectively, thus confirming reproducible and precise quantitation. Compared to fresh WB, no significant degradation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was observed after 2.5 h of drying at room temperature. VAMS 5-CH3-H4folate was stable for at least 3 weeks at −20°C. In our pilot study, accurate and diagnostically conclusive determination of folate status was verified. Nevertheless, blood sampling should be performed by trained individuals to avoid substantial errors concerning the absorbed volume. Endogenous folate in rat serum and chicken pancreas caused a significant background especially at low blood 5-CH3-H4folate levels and, thus, for polyglutamate deconjugation, these background folates or alternative mixtures need to be removed. The superior feasibility of a minimized blood collection with VAMS allows further progress regarding time- and cost-effective methodologies in newborn or population screenings for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate status.

The beneficial effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), permanently colonizing the human intestine or transiently obtained from food, have been extensively reported. However, the molecular understanding of how LAB modulate human physiology is still limited. G protein-coupled receptors for hydroxycarboxylic acids (HCAR) are regulators of immune functions and energy homeostasis under changing metabolic and dietary conditions. Most mammals have two HCAR (HCA1, HCA2) but humans and other hominids contain a third member (HCA3) in their genomes. A plausible hypothesis why HCA3 function was advantageous in hominid evolution was lacking. Here, we used a combination of evolutionary, analytical and functional methods to unravel the role of HCA3
in vitro and in vivo. The functional studies included different pharmacological assays, analyses of human monocytes and pharmacokinetic measurements in human. We report the discovery of the interaction of D-phenyllactic acid (D-PLA) and the human host through highly potent activation of HCA3. D-PLA is an anti-bacterial metabolite found in high concentrations in LAB-fermented food such as Sauerkraut. We demonstrate that D-PLA from such alimentary sources is well absorbed from the human gut leading to high plasma and urine levels and triggers pertussis toxin-sensitive migration of primary human monocytes in an HCA3-dependent manner.

Here we attempt to clarify the issue, and offer a solution to this paradox that has been frequently overlooked: Intelligence is a trait with unusual properties that create a large reservoir of hidden Gene-Environment (GE) networks, allowing for the contribution of high genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in IQ. GE interplay (consisting of both interactions and correlations between genes and environment) is difficult to specify with current methods, and is underestimated in standard metrics of heritability (thus inflating estimates of “genetic” effects). We describe empirical evidence for GE interplay in intelligence, with malleability of intelligence existing on top of heritability. The evidence covers IQ gains consequent to adoption/immigration, changes in heritability across lifespan and socio-economic status, gains in IQ over time consequent to societal development (the Flynn effect), the slowdown of age-related cognitive declines, and IQ gains via early education. The GE solution has novel implications for enduring problems including our inability to identify intelligence-related genes (also known as IQ’s “missing heritability”), and the dissipation of initial benefits from early intervention programs (e.g., “Head Start”). The GE solution can be a powerful guide to future research, and may also aid in the implementation of policies to overcome barriers to the development of intelligence, particularly in impoverished and under-privileged populations.Keywords: Intelligence, Heritability, Gene-environment interplay, Adoption, Early intervention",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5754247/

In this study, we confirmed the occurrence of brain dopamine and serotonin deficiencies in association with severe behavioral alterations and cognitive impairments in hyperphenylalaninemic C57BL/6-Pahenu2/enu2 mice, a model of human PKU. Phenylalanine-reducing treatments, including either dietary phenylalanine restriction or liver-directed gene therapy, initiated during adulthood were associated with increased brain monoamine content along with improvements in nesting behavior but without a change in the severe cognitive deficits exhibited by these mice. At euthanasia, there was in Pahenu2/enu2 brain a significant reduction in the protein abundance and maximally stimulated activities of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), the rate limiting enzymes catalyzing neuronal dopamine and serotonin synthesis respectively, in comparison to levels seen in wild type brain. Phenylalanine-reducing treatments initiated during adulthood did not affect brain TH or TPH2 content or maximal activity. Despite this apparent fixed deficit in striatal TH and TPH2 activities, initiation of phenylalanine-reducing treatments yielded substantial correction of brain monoamine neurotransmitter content, suggesting that phenylalanine-mediated competitive inhibition of already constitutively reduced TH and TPH2 activities is the primary cause of brain monoamine deficiency in Pahenu2 mouse brain. We propose that CNS monoamine deficiency may be the cause of the partially reversible adverse behavioral effects associated with chronic HPA in Pahenu2 mice, but that phenylalanine-reducing treatments initiated during adulthood are unable to correct the neuropathology and attendant cognitive deficits that develop during juvenile life in late-treated Pahenu2/enu2 mice.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine, tryptophan, dopamine, serotonin, tyrosine hydroxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase, cognition, behavior",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5786171/

In order to further its therapeutic potential, a dairy Lactococcus lactis strain was engineered to express murine IL-35 (LL-IL35), and this recombinant strain was applied to suppress collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Oral administration of LL-IL35 effectively reduced the incidence and disease severity of CIA. When administered therapeutically, LL-IL35 abruptly halted CIA progression with no increase in disease severity by reducing neutrophil influx into the joints. LL-IL35 treatment reduced IFN-γ and IL-17 3.7- and 8.5-fold, respectively, and increased IL-10 production compared to diseased mice.

To pair the groups, we considered chronological age (months), sex, educational level, type of school (public or private) and socioeconomic status. To assess the groups we used structured and semi-structured Observation of Communicative Behavior and applied the ABFW Child Language Test - Part B-Vocabulary and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. To assess the legal representatives we applied an anamnesis questionnaire and the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory. The assessment of the teachers consisted of the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory and a Student Assessment Protocol developed by the authors.Results For the observation of communicative behavior, the categories with the highest losses were: narrative, maintaining dialogic activities and attention difficulties. In the ABFW Child Language Test and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test there were statistically significant differences. In the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory there were statistically significant differences in expressive vocabulary, but no differences in receptive vocabulary, for both the mothers and the teachers.Conclusion Children born prematurely with low risk of neurological sequelae in preschool age may have greater difficulties in linguistic performance than their peers born to term.Keywords: Preterm infant, Child development, Vocabulary, Preschool child",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6089568/

A review of 500 Phe levels highlighted that 52% of the results were within the target range. Collaboration between information and communication technologies (ICT) departments, metabolic laboratory, and metabolic dietitians enabled the development of the PKU texting system. Following a successful pilot study, the system was then offered to all PKU patients aged over 2 years. The Phe is analysed and authorised on the laboratory system. The demographics are matched with the patient mobile phone number. Text messages are then validated and sent by the dietitian via a web portal using the Defero SMS texting service. Approximately 290 patients/families currently use the texting system. In order to assess the effectiveness of this quality improvement initiative, a patient survey was carried out in 2017. This showed 87% rated the system as either very good or excellent. 94% agreed it was time saving. 84% felt there was no influence on dietary compliance. Analysis of financial implications on dietetic time over 21 months revealed savings of €3,275 and 580 hours of dietetic time.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that maintains glucose homeostasis by stimulating insulin secretion. Its natural cleavage product GLP-1 (9-36) lacks insulinotropic effects and has a low binding affinity for GLP-1 receptors; thus, GLP-1 (9-36) has historically been identified as an inactive metabolite. Conversely, recent work has demonstrated interesting physiological properties of GLP-1 (9-36) such as cardioprotection and neuroprotection. We have previously shown that GLP-1 (9-36) administration enhances neuronal plasticity in young WT mice and ameliorates cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we report that systemic administration of GLP-1 (9-36) in Ts65Dn DS model mice of either sex resulted in decreased mitochondrial oxidative stress in hippocampus and improved dendritic spine morphology, increase of mature spines and reduction of immature spines. Importantly, these molecular alterations translated into functional changes in that long-term potentiation failure and cognitive impairments in TsDn65 DS model mice were rescued with GLP-1 (9-36) treatment. We also show that chronic GLP-1 (9-36) treatment did not alter glucose tolerance in either WT or DS model mice. Our findings suggest that GLP-1 (9-36) treatment may have therapeutic potential for DS and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with increased neuronal oxidative stress.Keywords: Alzheimer’s disease, Down syndrome, GLP-1 (9-36), LTP, oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6520642/

In most cases, it results from a loss‐of‐function mutation in the gene encoding methyl‐CPG‐binding protein 2 (MECP2). Currently, about 900 unique MECP2 variations (benign and pathogenic) have been identified and it is suspected that the different mutations contribute to different levels of disease severity. For researchers and clinicians, it is important that genotype–phenotype information is available to identify disease‐causing mutations for diagnosis, to aid in clinical management of the disorder, and to provide counseling for parents. In this study, 13 genotype–phenotype databases were surveyed for their general functionality and availability of RTT‐specific MECP2 variation data. For each database, we investigated findability and interoperability alongside practical user functionality, and type and amount of genetic and phenotype data. The main conclusions are that, as well as being challenging to find these databases and specific MECP2 variants held within, interoperability is as yet poorly developed and requires effort to search across databases. Nevertheless, we found several thousand online database entries for MECP2 variations and their associated phenotypes, diagnosis, or predicted variant effects, which is a good starting point for researchers and clinicians who want to provide, annotate, and use the data.Keywords: databases, FAIR data, genetic variation, MECP2, phenotype, Rett syndrome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6033003/

One of the resulting major challenges refers to the management of primary or secondary residual executive function deficits in affected children. These deficits lead to problems in the ability to acquire, understand, and apply abstract and complex knowledge and to plan, direct, and control actions. Executive functions deficits are important to consider because they are highly predictive of functioning in social and academic aspects of daily life. We argue that current clinical practice does not sufficiently account for the complex cognitive processes in this population. This is because widely applied pharmacological interventions only rarely account for the complexity of the underlying neuronal mechanisms and do not fit well into possibly powerful “individualized medicine” approaches. Novel treatment approaches targeting deficits in executive functions in seriously ill children could focus on neuronal oscillations, as these have some specific relations to different aspects of executive function. Importantly, such treatment approaches can be individually tailored to the individuals’ deficits and can be transferred into home-treatment or e-health solutions. These approaches are easy-to-use, can be easily integrated into daily life, and are becoming increasingly cost-effective.Keywords: cognitive dysfunctions, executive function, therapy, cognitive training, chronic disease",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915456/

Although the underlying biological mechanisms remain largely unknown, clefts are thought to be complex disorders influenced by genetic, environmental, and potentially epigenetic factors.MethodsIn blood samples from 2- to 3-day-old infants (n = 747) collected in a nationwide population-based study of orofacial clefts in Norway, we measured DNA methylation profiles for more than 450,000 CpGs and then conducted epigenome-wide association analyses (EWAS). We tested methylation profile difference at each CpG between controls (n = 436) and each of the cleft subtypes (92 cleft lip only, CLO; 84 cleft palate only, CPO; 132 cleft lip and palate, CLP). We also compared controls to various combinations of case groups and compared case subtypes to each other. Finally, using the EWAS results, we searched for larger differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with orofacial clefts.ResultsIn EWAS comparing controls to individual cleft subtypes, we found no significant associations at a Bonferroni P value threshold of 10−7. After pooling case groups, we found two significantly differentially methylated CpGs: cg09696939 near gene BICC1 is associated with CLO+CLP (P = 9.58 × 10−8); cg26985354 in gene CLASRP is associated with CPO+CLP (P = 7.38 × 10−8). In DMR analysis, we identified a total of 56 significant regions when comparing controls to individual cleft subtypes (10 for CLO, 6 for CPO, 41 for CLP). Only one DMR is shared among the three cleft groups. In combined case group analysis, we found 26 DMRs for CLP+CLO, 31 for CLP+CPO, and 37 when all subtypes are combined. Finally, in case-case comparisons of subtypes, we identified 10 DMRs when comparing CLP to CPO, 9 in CLP compared to CLO, and 13 in CLP compared to CPO.ConclusionsWe identified two individual CpGs and multiple DMRs that differ between controls and cleft case subtypes.

Parents are responsible for supervising their child’s treatment for PKU, which may impact on their experience of distress. This cross-sectional study aimed to identify the factors that contribute to distress in parents who care for a child with PKU, distinct from parents in the general population. Thirty-eight parents of children and adolescents with PKU and 32 parents in the general population completed the questionnaires measuring parental psychological resilience, child behaviour problems, perceived social support and distress. Parents of children with PKU also completed measures of their child’s care dependency and behaviour related to developmental and intellectual disabilities. The findings revealed no statistically significant differences in distress between the groups, but parents of children with PKU reported more child behaviour problems. Multiple regression analysis identified that parental psychological resilience and child anxious behaviour explained 35% of the variance in distress for parents of children with PKU. By comparison, parental psychological resilience and generic child behaviour only accounted for 19% of the variance in distress for parents in the general population. This has implications for developing interventions in clinical settings that aim to reduce parents’ distress by enhancing their psychological resilience and supporting them to manage child behaviour difficulties, particularly anxious behaviour.

In this study, we compare the efficacy and specificity of delivery of vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviral vectors to mouse liver by a number of injection schemes. Exploiting in vivo bioluminescence imaging as a readout after lentiviral gene transfer, we compare delivery by (1) “conventional” tail-vein injections, (2) “primed” injections, (3) “hydrodynamic” injections, or (4) direct “intrahepatic” injections into exposed livers. Reporter gene activity demonstrate potent and targeted delivery to liver by hydrodynamic injections. Enhanced efficacy is confirmed by analysis of liver sections from mice treated with GFP-encoding vectors, demonstrating 10-fold higher transduction rates and gene delivery to ∼80% of hepatocytes after hydrodynamic vector delivery. In summary, lentiviral vector transfer to mouse liver can be strongly augmented by hydrodynamic tail-vein injections, resulting in both reduced off-target delivery and transduction of the majority of hepatocytes.

Participants to the survey (n = 111; response rate 94%) were asked to complete a structured questionnaire. Patients appeared to have an altered perception and awareness of the disease. About 40% of them did not consider PKU a disease and, despite declaring regular monitoring of phenylalanine levels (85%), nearly half of them reported a high plasma value over the last 6 months (>600 μmol/L, 48%) or were unable to specify it (31%). Adherence to PKU diet was unsatisfactory, with increased consumption of natural protein sources and reduced daily use of amino-acid supplements (<4–5 times/day in 82% patients). In addition to the intrinsic characteristics of AA formula (palatability, ease of use), the most important factor influencing their consumption was the increased social pressure associated with their use (55%). Plasma phenylalanine periodical measurements (61%) and examinations at metabolic centers (49%) were considered relevant for compliance to diet. In Italian adult PKU patients dietary management was found to be inadequate, likely due to inappropriate perception and knowledge of the disease, and lack of awareness of the negative impact of poor metabolic control in adult life.

At T2 additional assessments of EF in daily life and mental health were performed. Childhood (i.e. 0–12 years) blood phenylalanine was significantly related to cognitive flexibility, executive motor control, EF in daily life and mental health in adulthood (i.e. at T2). Patients with a greater increase in phenylalanine levels after the age of 12 performed more poorly on EF-tasks at T2. Group-based analyses showed that patients with phenylalanine <360 µmol/L in childhood and phenylalanine ≥360 µmol/L from age 13 onwards (n = 11) had better cognitive flexibility and executive motor control than those who had phenylalanine ≥360 µmol/L throughout life (n = 7), supporting the notion that phenylalanine should be below the recommended upper treatment target of 360 µmol/L during childhood for better outcome in adulthood. Despite some results indicating additional influence of phenylalanine levels between 13 and 17 years of age, evidence for a continued influence of phenylalanine levels after childhood on adult outcomes was largely lacking.

In nature, l-PAPA occurs as an intermediate of the chloramphenicol biosynthesis pathway in Streptomyces venezuelae. Here we demonstrate that the model organism Escherichia coli can be transformed with metabolic grafting approaches to result in an improved l-PAPA producing strain.ResultsEscherichia coli K-12 cells were genetically engineered for the production of l-PAPA from glycerol as main carbon source. To do so, genes for a 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase (pabAB from Corynebacterium glutamicum), and genes encoding a 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate mutase and a 4-amino-4-deoxyprephenate dehydrogenase (papB and papC, both from Streptomyces venezuelae) were cloned and expressed in E. coli W3110 (lab strain LJ110). In shake flask cultures with minimal medium this led to the formation of ca. 43 ± 2 mg l−1 of l-PAPA from 5 g l−1 glycerol. By expression of additional chromosomal copies of the tktA and glpX genes, and of plasmid-borne aroFBL genes in a tyrR deletion strain, an improved l-PAPA producer was obtained which gave a titer of 5.47 ± 0.4 g l−1
l-PAPA from 33.3 g l−1 glycerol (0.16 g l-PAPA/g of glycerol) in fed-batch cultivation (shake flasks). Finally, in a fed-batch fermenter cultivation, a titer of 16.7 g l−1
l-PAPA was obtained which is the highest so far reported value for this non-proteinogenic amino acid.ConclusionHere we show that E. coli is a suitable chassis strain for l-PAPA production. Modifying the flux to the product and improved supply of precursor, by additional gene copies of glpX, tkt and aroFBL together with the deletion of the tyrR gene, increased the yield and titer.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12934-018-0996-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Escherichia coli, Non-proteinogenic aromatic amino acids, p-Amino-l-phenylalanine, Metabolic grafting",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6148955/

Familial hypercholesterolaemia is relatively common, but is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Cardiologists are likely to encounter many individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia; however, patients presenting with premature ASCVD are rarely screened for familial hypercholesterolaemia and fasting lipid levels are infrequently documented. Given that individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia and ASCVD are at a particularly high risk of subsequent cardiac events, this is a missed opportunity for preventive therapy. Furthermore, because there is a 50% chance that first-degree relatives of individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia will also be affected by the disorder, the underdiagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia among patients with ASCVD is a barrier to cascade screening and the prevention of ASCVD in affected relatives. Targeted screening of patients with ASCVD is an effective strategy to identify new familial hypercholesterolaemia index cases. Statins are the standard treatment for individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia; however, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not achieved in a large proportion of patients despite treatment. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have been shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels considerably in individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia who are concurrently receiving the maximal tolerated statin dose. The clinical benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors must, however, also be considered in terms of their cost-effectiveness. Increased awareness of familial hypercholesterolaemia is required among healthcare professionals, particularly cardiologists and primary care physicians, in order to start early preventive measures and to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with familial hypercholesterolaemia and ASCVD.Keywords: Cardiovascular disease, familial hypercholesterolaemia, PCSK9, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574519/

Indeed, changes in the PKU gut microbiota compared with healthy controls have been previously reported. In this study we compared the gut microbial communities of children with PKU and with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP, unrestricted diet). For each group, we enrolled 21 children (4–18 years old), for a total dataset of 42 subjects. We assessed dietary intake and performed gut microbiota analysis by sequencing the V3–V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were quantified by gas chromatographic analysis. While alpha-diversity analysis showed no significant differences between PKU and MHP groups, microbial community analysis highlighted a significant separation of the gut microbiota according to both unweighted (p = 0.008) and weighted Unifrac distances (p = 0.033). Major differences were seen within the Firmicutes phylum. Indeed, PKU children were depleted in Faecalibacterium spp. and enriched in Blautia spp. and Clostridium spp (family Lachnospiraceae). We found a divergent response of members of the Firmicutes phylum with respect to daily glycemic index, higher in PKU children. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, unclassified Ruminococcaceae and, to a lesser extent Roseburia spp. negatively correlated with glycemic index, whereas unclassified Lachnospiraceae were positively associated. Indicator species analysis suggested F. prausnitzii be related to MHP status and Ruminococcus bromii to be associated with PKU. Despite PKU children having a higher vegetable and fiber intake, resembling a vegan diet, their gut microbial profile is different from the microbiota reported in the literature for individuals consuming a high-fiber/low-protein diet. Indeed, beneficial microorganisms, such as F. prausnitzii, considered a biomarker for a healthy status and one of the main butyrate producers, are depleted in PKU gut microbiota.

constitute the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism, and is most
often caused by defects in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) function resulting in
accumulation of Phe to neurotoxic levels. Despite the success of dietary
intervention in preventing permanent neurological damage, individuals living
with PKU clamor for additional non-dietary therapies. The bulk of
disease-associated mutations are PAH missense variants, which occur throughout
the entire 452 amino acid human PAH protein. While some disease-associated
mutations affect protein structure (e.g. truncations) and others encode
catalytically dead variants, most have been viewed as defective in protein
folding/stability. Here we refine this view to address how PKU-associated
missense variants can perturb the equilibrium among alternate native PAH
structures (resting-state PAH and activated PAH), thus shifting the tipping
point of this equilibrium to a neurotoxic Phe concentration. This refined view
of PKU introduces opportunities for the design or discovery of therapeutic
pharmacological chaperones that can help restore the tipping point to healthy
Phe levels and how such a therapeutic might work with or without the inhibitory
pharmacological chaperone BH4. Dysregulation of an equilibrium of
architecturally distinct native PAH structures departs from the

This method, which we termed “next-generation metabolic screening” (NGMS), can detect >10,000 features in each sample.

In 2017, we review the history of the HPPP and the advances of human plasma proteomics in general, including several recent achievements. We then present the latest 2017-04 build of Human Plasma PeptideAtlas, which yields ~43 million peptide-spectrum matches and 122,730 distinct peptide sequences from 178 individual experiments at a 1% protein-level FDR globally across all experiments. Applying the latest Human Proteome Project Data Interpretation Guidelines, we catalog 3509 proteins that have at least two non-nested uniquely-mapping peptides of 9 amino acids or more and >1300 additional proteins with ambiguous evidence. We apply the same two-peptide guideline to historical PeptideAtlas builds going back to 2006 and examine the progress made in the past ten years in plasma proteome coverage. We also compare the distribution of proteins in historical PeptideAtlas builds in various RNA-abundance and cellular localization categories. We then discuss advances in plasma proteomics based on targeted mass spectrometry as well as affinity assays, which during early 2017 target ~2000 proteins.

Recently, PAH exon 11 was identified as a vulnerable exon due to a weak 3’ splice site, with different exonic mutations affecting exon 11 splicing through disruption of exonic splicing regulatory elements. In this study, we report a novel intron 11 regulatory element, which is involved in exon 11 splicing, as revealed by the investigated pathogenic effect of variants c.1199+17G>A and c.1199+20G>C, identified in PKU patients. Both mutations cause exon 11 skipping in a minigene system. RNA binding assays indicate that binding of U1snRNP70 to this intronic region is disrupted, concomitant with a slightly increased binding of inhibitors hnRNPA1/2. We have investigated the effect of deletions and point mutations, as well as overexpression of adapted U1snRNA to show that this splicing regulatory motif is important for regulation of correct splicing at the natural 5’ splice site. The results indicate that U1snRNP binding downstream of the natural 5’ splice site determines efficient exon 11 splicing, thus providing a basis for development of therapeutic strategies to correct PAH exon 11 splicing mutations. In this work, we expand the functional effects of non-canonical intronic U1 snRNP binding by showing that it may enhance exon definition and that, consequently, intronic mutations may cause exon skipping by a novel mechanism, where they disrupt stimulatory U1 snRNP binding close to the 5’ splice site. Notably, our results provide further understanding of the reported therapeutic effect of exon specific U1 snRNA for splicing mutations in disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5933811/

This genetic diversity is responsible for many of the interindividual differences in food preferences, nutritional needs, and dietary responses between humans. The field of nutrigenetics aims to utilize this type of genetic information in order to personalize diets for optimal health. One of the most well-studied genetic variants affecting human dietary patterns and health is the lactase persistence mutation, which enables an individual to digest milk sugar into adulthood. Lactase persistence is one of the most influential Mendelian factors affecting human dietary patterns to occur since the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution. However, the lactase persistence mutation is only one of many mutations that can influence the relationship between dairy intake and disease risk. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available nutrigenetic literature investigating the relationships between genetics, dairy intake, and health outcomes. Nonetheless, the understanding of an individual’s nutrigenetic responses is just one component of personalized nutrition. In addition to nutrigenetic responses, future studies should also take into account nutrigenomic responses (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic), and phenotypic/characteristic traits (age, gender, activity level, disease status, etc.), as these factors all interact with diet to influence health.Keywords: nutrigenetics, gene–diet interactions, precision nutrition, polymorphisms, inter-individual response, dairy, milk, lactase persistence, obesity, cardiometabolic disease",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537825/

Despite the severe consequences of poor metabolic control, many children and adolescents have phenylalanine levels above their recommended limits. This systematic review was the first to examine studies reporting demographic and/or psychosocial influences on blood phenylalanine levels, with the aim to identify factors that were robustly linked with metabolic control. Four electronic databases were searched, yielding 1,808 articles. Articles were included if they reported a statistical examination of the association between one or more demographic or psychosocial factor(s) and metabolic control (as measured by blood phenylalanine concentration) for children and adolescents with PKU. Twenty-nine studies were selected for inclusion, which examined a range of child, parent and family factors related to blood phenylalanine levels. The most reproducible association was with child age, with metabolic control worsening with increasing age. This suggests that interventions promoting treatment adherence would be particularly beneficial for adolescents.

In PKU, feeding patterns/practices during weaning in PKU have not been formally evaluated. In this longitudinal, prospective, case-control study (n = 20) infants with PKU transitioning to a second-stage PS, were recruited at weaning (4–6 months) for a comparison of feeding practices and development with non-PKU infants. Subjects were monitored monthly to 12 months and at age 15 months, 18 months and 24 months for: feeding progression; food textures; motor skill development and self-feeding; feeding environment; gastrointestinal symptoms; and negative feeding behaviours. Children with PKU had comparable weaning progression to non-PKU infants including texture acceptance, infant formula volume and self-feeding skills. However, children with PKU had more prolonged Phe-free infant formula bottle-feeding and parental spoon feeding than controls; fewer meals/snacks per day; and experienced more flatulence (p = 0.0005), burping (p = 0.001), retching (p = 0.03); and less regurgitation (p = 0.003). Negative behaviours associated with PS at age 10–18 months, coincided with the age of teething. Use of semi-solid PS in PKU supports normal weaning development/progression but parents require support to manage the complexity of feeding and to normalise the social inclusivity of their child’s family food environment.

Background and Objective: Orphan drugs have been a highlight of discussions due to their higher prices than non-orphan drugs. There is currently no European consensus on the method of value assessment for orphan drugs. This study assessed the relationship between the prevalence of rare diseases and the annual treatment cost of orphan drugs in France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and UK.
Methods: Approved orphan drugs and prevalence data were extracted from the European Medicines Agency website. Annual treatment costs were calculated using ex-factory price. Simple regression was used to analyse the relationship between costs and prevalence. A specific bivariate analysis was performed for the rarest diseases (≤1 per 10,000).
Results: 120 drugs were analysed. Prevalence ranged from 0.001 to 5 per 10,000 (mean 1.24, median 1). Annual treatment costs per patient ranged from €755 to €1,051,956 (mean €100,000, median €39,303). Results show a statistically significant inverse correlation between annual treatment cost and disease prevalence in all countries (France: r = −0.370, p = 0.002; Germany: r = −0.365, p = 0.002; Italy: r = −0.340, p = 0.002; Spain: r = −0.316, p = 0.041; UK: r = −0.358, p = 0.0004; Sweden: r = −0.414, p = 0.014; Norway: r = −0.367, p = 0.002).

Conclusions: This study shows an inverse correlation between annual treatment cost and prevalence with high statistical significance in the studied countries.

Identify early signs of treatment discontinuation.MethodologyThis longitudinal, retrospective study included 75 children diagnosed through newborn screening, ages 7 to 13 years. Data on blood Phe concentration, number of blood samples sent, proportion of samples with Phe concentrations over the recommended range, and number of visits to the metabolism clinic were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the variables that predict treatment discontinuation before 13 years of age.ResultsA progressive increase in mean blood Phe concentrations with age was identified. The greatest increase occurred between the first and second years of life. By age ten, mean Phe blood concentration of the group was above the recommended range. The proportion of samples with Phe concentrations over the recommended range also increased with age, from an average of 13% during the first year of life to 67% in early adolescence. Sixty-eight percent of the children attended the outpatient clinic and sent samples from birth to the time of the study. Individuals who discontinued follow-up showed significantly higher mean blood Phe concentrations (360 vs. 220.9 μmol/L; p = 0.004) and the proportion of samples over the recommended range (37% vs. 12% p = 0.002) was significantly higher during the second year of life. Mean age for children who discontinued treatment was 5.5 years of age. Blood Phe concentration values at 12 to 23 months of age and at 6 to 8 years of age significantly predicted treatment discontinuation before 13 years of age.ConclusionTreatment adherence in PKU diminishes with age.

A large set of miRNA target-specific regulatory sub-pathways (RSPs) having the form (T, G1, G2) was built from the integrated data and stored, where T is a miRNA-associated target gene, G1 (G2) is a gene/protein interacting with T (G1). Each sequence (T, G1, G2) was assigned a p-value weighted by the participation of the three genes in molecular interactions and reaction pathways.ResultsA web service platform, miRDRN (http://mirdrn.ncu.edu.tw/mirdrn/), was built.

Although many studies show that stressful conditions reduce the number of newborn neurons in the adult dentate gyrus (DG), little is known about whether and how stress impacts on dendritic development and structural maturation of these newborn neurons. We, herein, demonstrate that chronic stress impacts differentially on doublecortin (DCX)-positive immature neurons in distinct phases of maturation. Specifically, the density of the DCX-positive immature neurons whose dendritic tree reaches the inner molecular layer (IML) of DG is reduced in stressed animals, whereas their dendritic complexity is increased. On the contrary, no change on the density of DCX-positive neurons whose dendritic tree extends to the medial/outer molecular layer (M/OML) of the DG is found under stress conditions, whereas the dendritic complexity of these cells is diminished. In addition, DCX+ cells displayed a more complex and longer arbor in the dendritic compartments located in the granular cell layer of the DG under stress conditions; on the contrary, their dendritic segments localized into the M/OML were shorter and less complex. These findings suggest that the neuroplastic effects of chronic stress on dendritic maturation and complexity of DCX+ immature neurons vary based on the different maturation stage of DCX-positive cells and the different DG sublayer, highlighting the complex and dynamic stress-driven neuroplasticity of immature neurons in the adult hippocampus.Subject terms: Neuroscience, Physiology, Psychiatric disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6486609/

For this validation we stored encapsulated samples either at ambient temperature or at several elevated temperatures to accelerate aging. We found that DNA extracted from stored samples was of good quality with a yield of extraction as expected. Degradation rates were estimated from the average fragment size of denatured DNA run on agarose gels and from qPCR reactions. At ambient temperature, these rates were too low to be measured but the degradation rate dependence on temperature followed Arrhenius’ law, making it possible to extrapolate degradation rates at 25°C.

Whole tissue RNA sequencing data from human, mouse and rat tissues revealed that GPR139 and the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) exhibited some similarities in their distribution patterns in the brain and pituitary gland. To determine if there was true co-expression of these two receptors, we applied double in situ hybridization in mouse tissues using the RNAscope® technique. GPR139 and DRD2 mRNA co-expressed in a majority of same cells within part of the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathways (ventral tegmental area and olfactory tubercle), the nigrostriatal pathway (compact part of substantia nigra and caudate putamen), and also the tuberoinfundibular pathway (arcuate hypothalamic nucleus and anterior lobe of pituitary). Both receptors mRNA also co-express in the same cells of the brain regions involved in responses to negative stimulus and stress, such as lateral habenula, lateral septum, interpeduncular nucleus, and medial raphe nuclei. GPR139 mRNA expression was detected in the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus as well as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. The functional interaction between GPR139 and DRD2 was studied in vitro using a calcium mobilization assay in cells co-transfected with both receptors from several species (human, rat, and mouse). The dopamine DRD2 agonist did not stimulate calcium response in cells expressing DRD2 alone consistent with the Gi signaling transduction pathway of this receptor.

Furthermore, whole liver replacement eliminates the possibility of using native liver as a possible target for future gene therapy in case of liver-based metabolic defects. Cell therapy has emerged as a potential alternative, as cells can provide the hepatic functions and engraft in the liver parenchyma. Various options have been proposed, including human or other species hepatocytes, hepatocyte-like cells derived from stem cells or more futuristic alternatives, such as combination therapies with different cell types, organoids and cell–biomaterial combinations.

The optimal amount and ratio of additional amino acids is undefined.AimA longitudinal, parallel, controlled study over 12 months evaluating a CGMP (CGMP-AA2) formulation compared with phenylalanine-free L-amino acid supplements (L-AA) on blood Phe, Tyr, Phe:Tyr ratio, biochemical nutritional status and growth in children with PKU. The CGMP-AA2 contained 36 mg Phe per 20 g protein equivalent.MethodsChildren with PKU, with a median age of 9.2 y (5-16y) were divided into 2 groups: 29 were given CGMP-AA2, 19 remained on Phe-free L-AA. The CGMP-AA2 formula gradually replaced L-AA, providing blood Phe concentrations were maintained within target range. Median blood Phe, Tyr, Phe:Tyr ratio and anthropometry, were compared within and between the two groups at baseline, 26 and 52 weeks. Nutritional biochemistry was studied at baseline and 26 weeks only.ResultsAt the end of 52 weeks only 48% of subjects were able to completely use CGMP-AA2 as their single source of protein substitute. At 52 weeks CGMP-AA2 provided a median of 75% (30–100) of the total protein substitute with the remainder being given as L-AA. Within the CGMP-AA2 group, blood Phe increased significantly between baseline and 52 weeks: [baseline to 26 weeks; baseline Phe 270 μmol/L (170–430); 26 weeks, Phe 300 μmol/L (125–485) p = 0.06; baseline to 52 weeks: baseline, Phe 270 μmol/L (170–430), 52 weeks Phe 300 μmol/L (200–490), p < 0.001)]. However, there were no differences between the CGMP-AA2 and L-AA group for Phe, Tyr, Phe:Tyr ratio or anthropometry at any of the three measured time points. Within the CGMP-AA2 group only weight (p = 0.0001) and BMI z scores (p = 0.0001) increased significantly between baseline to 52 weeks. Whole blood and plasma selenium were significantly higher (whole blood selenium [p = 0.0002]; plasma selenium [p = 0.0007]) at 26 weeks in the CGMP-AA2 group compared L-AA. No differences were observed within the L-AA group for any of the nutritional markers.ConclusionsCGMP-AA increases blood Phe concentrations and so it can only be used partly to contribute to protein substitute in some children with PKU. CGMP-AA should be carefully introduced in children with PKU and close monitoring of blood Phe control is essential.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13023-019-1011-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Glycomacropeptide, Phenylalanine, Large neutral amino acids, Protein substitute, Phenylketonuria",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6377744/

All infants had newborn metabolic screening data available. Data included linked birth certificate and mother and infant hospital discharge records. Mortality was derived from linked death certificates and death discharge information. Each death within 7 days was matched to 4 surviving controls by gestational age and birth weight z score category, leaving 93 cases and 372 controls. The association between explanatory variables and 7-day survival was modeled via stepwise logistic regression. Infant characteristics, 42 metabolites, and 12 metabolite ratios were considered for model inclusion. Model performance was assessed via area under the curve.ResultsThe final model included 1 characteristic and 11 metabolites. The model demonstrated a strong association between metabolic patterns and infant survival (area under the curve [AUC] 0.885, 95% CI 0.851-0.920). Furthermore, a model with just the selected metabolites performed better (AUC 0.879, 95% CI 0.841-0.916) than a model with multiple clinical characteristics (AUC 0.685, 95% CI 0.627-0.742).ConclusionsUse of metabolomics significantly strengthens the association with 7-day survival in infants born extremely premature. Physicians may be able to use metabolic profiles at birth to refine mortality risks and inform postnatal counseling for infants born at <26 weeks of gestation.Abbreviations: AUC, Area under the curve; IVH, Intraventricular hemorrhage; NBS, Newborn screening; NRN, Neonatal Research Network; ROC, Receiver operating curve; TPN, Total parenteral nutrition",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6016556/

Homozygous siblings with different treatment histories represent an excellent
model to study both the phenotypic manifestation of mutations and the efficacy
of therapy. We compared phenylketonuria (PKU) manifestations in two different
gender siblings who were homozygous carriers of a rare phenylalanine
hydroxylase (PAH) mutation, p.R155H, subjected to different
treatments. PKU caused by mild mutations may be easily underdiagnosed if the
diagnosis is based solely on the phenylalanine (Phe) blood concentration. One
of the described patients is an example of this diagnostic error. For reducing
diagnostic errors, we suggest the use of more elaborate methods in screening
practice, in particular mass spectrometric analysis of blood metabolites, the
efficiency of which is demonstrated in the present study.

Total antidrug antibodies (ADA), neutralizing antibodies, immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibodies against PAL and PEG, IgG and IgM circulating immune complex (CIC) levels, complement components 3 and 4 (C3/C4), plasma Phe, and safety were assessed at baseline and throughout the study. Pegvaliase-specific IgE levels were measured in patients after hypersensitivity adverse events (HAE).FindingsAll patients developed ADA against PAL, peaking by 6 months and then stabilizing. Most developed transient antibody responses against PEG, peaking by 3 months, then returning to baseline by 9 months. Binding of ADA to pegvaliase led to CIC formation and complement activation, which were highest during early treatment. Blood Phe decreased over time as CIC levels and complement activation declined and pegvaliase dosage increased. HAEs were most frequent during early treatment and declined over time.

Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment through newborn screening has gradually shifted treatment goals from the prevention of disabling complications to the optimization of long term outcomes. However, clinical evidence demonstrates that subtle suboptimal neurocognitive outcomes are present in the early and continuously diet-treated population with PAH deficiency. This may be attributed to variation in blood phenylalanine levels to outside treatment range and this, in turn, is possibly due to a combination of factors; disease severity, dietary noncompliance and differences in practice related to the management of PAH deficiency. One of CIMDRN’s goals is to understand current practices in the diagnosis and management of PAH deficiency in the pediatric population, from the perspective of both health care providers and patients/families.ObjectivesWe investigated Canadian metabolic dietitians’ perspectives on the nutritional management of children with PAH deficiency, awareness of recently published North American treatment and nutritional guidelines in relation to PAH deficiency, and nutritional care practices within and outside these guidelines.MethodsWe invited 33 dietitians to participate in a survey, to ascertain their use of recently published guidelines and their practices in relation to the nutritional care of pediatric patients with PAH deficiency.ResultsWe received 19 responses (59% response rate). All participants reported awareness of published guidelines for managing PAH deficiency. To classify disease severity, 89% of dietitians reported using pre-treatment blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels, alone or in combination with other factors. 74% of dietitians reported using blood Phe levels ≥360 μmol/L (6 mg/dL) as the criterion for initiating a Phe-restricted diet. All respondents considered 120-360 μmol/L (2–6 mg/dL) as the optimal treatment range for blood Phe in children 0–9 years old, but there was less agreement on blood Phe targets for older children. Most dietitians reported similar approaches to diet assessment and counseling: monitoring growth trends, use of 3 day diet records for intake analysis, individualization of diet goals, counseling patients to count grams of dietary natural protein or milligrams of dietary Phe, and monitoring blood Phe, tyrosine and ferritin.ConclusionWhile Canadian dietitians’ practices in managing pediatric PAH deficiency are generally aligned with those of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), and with the associated treatment and nutritional guidelines from Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (GMDI), variation in many aspects of care reflects ongoing uncertainty and a need for robust evidence.Keywords: PAH deficiency, Phenylketonuria, PKU, Management practices, Nutrition management, PAH deficiency practice guidelines, Metabolic dietitians’ survey",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6323774/

Targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the major strategies for AD therapeutics, as cholinergic pathways in the cerebral cortex and basal forebrain are compromised. Herein, we report the design of some copper and other metal based donepezil derivatives, employing density functional theory (DFT). All designed compounds are optimized at the B3LYP/SDD level of theory. Dipole moments, electronic energie, enthalpies, Gibbs free energies, and HOMO-LUMO gaps of these modified compounds are also investigated in the subsequent analysis. The molecules were then subjected to molecular docking analysis with AChE to study the molecular interactions broadly. Ensemble based docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the best candidates were also performed. Docking and MD simulation reveal that modified drugs are more potent than unmodified donepezil, where Trp86, Tyr337, Phe330 residues play some important roles in drug-receptor interactions. According to ensemble based docking, D9 shows greater binding affinity compared to the parent in most conformations obtained from protein data bank and MD simulation. In addition, it is observed that the π- π stacking with the residues of Trp86, Tyr337, Tyr341, Tyr124 and Trp286 may be required for strong ligand binding. Moreover, ADME/T analysis suggests that modified derivatives are less toxic and have improved pharmacokinetic properties than those of the parent drug.

Nutrient deficiencies may occur due to strict diet. This study is aimed at evaluating the dietary intake and blood concentrations of micronutrients and essential fatty acids (FA), bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture history in patients on long-term dietary treatment.MethodsSixty early diagnosed Dutch patients (aged 1–39 years) were included in a multi-center cross-sectional study. Their dietary intake, blood concentrations of micronutrients, FA, fracture history and BMD were assessed.ResultsSelenium dietary intake and serum concentrations were low in 14 and 46% of patients, respectively. The serum 25-OH vitamin D2 + D3 concentration was low in 14% of patients while 20% of patients had a low vitamin D intake. Zinc serum concentrations were below normal in 14% of patients, despite adequate intake. Folic acid serum concentrations and intake were elevated. Despite safe total protein and fat intake, arginine plasma concentrations and erythrocyte eicosapentaenoic acid were below reference values in 19 and 6% of patients, respectively. Low BMD (Z-score <-2) was slightly more prevalent in patients, but the lifetime fracture prevalence was comparable to the general population.ConclusionsDutch patients with PKU on long-term dietary treatment have a near normal nutrient status.

Altering amplification time, temperature or number of replicates did not affect our results. We found that spot size i.e. amount of input material could be reduced without compromising the quality of the array genotyping data. We also showed that whole genome amplification reaction volumes can be reduced by a factor of 4, without compromising the DNA quality.DiscussionWhole genome amplified DNA samples from dried blood spots is well suited for array genotyping and produces robust and reliable genotype data. However, the amplification process introduces additional noise to the data, making detection of structural variants such as copy number variants difficult. With this study, we explore ways of optimizing the amplification protocol in order to reduce noise and increase data quality. We found, that the amplification process was very robust, and that changes in amplification time or temperature did not alter the genotyping calls or quality of the array data. Adding additional replicates of each sample also lead to insignificant changes in the array data. Thus, the amount of noise introduced by the amplification process was consistent regardless of changes made to the amplification protocol. We also explored ways of decreasing material expenditure by reducing the spot size or the amplification reaction volume.

In our previous review, we described brain cholesterol metabolism in control
conditions and in the case of some rare neurological pathologies linked to
defects in the genes which are directly involved in the synthesis and/or
traffic of cholesterol. Here, we have analyzed disruptions in cholesterol
homeostasis in widespread neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s diseases) and autism spectrum disorders. We particularly
focused on the synaptic dysfunctions that could arise from changes in both
membrane cholesterol availability and oxysterol production. Notably,
alterations in the brain cholesterol metabolism and neurotransmission occur in
the early stages of these pathologies and the polymorphism of the genes
associated with cholesterol homeostasis and synaptic communication affects the
risk of onset and severity of these diseases. In addition, pharmacological and
genetic manipulations of brain cholesterol homeostasis in animal models
frequently have marked effects on the progression of neurodegenerative
diseases. Thus, the development of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and
autism spectrum disorders may be partially associated with an imbalance of
cholesterol homeostasis that leads to changes in the membrane cholesterol and
oxysterol levels that, in turn, modulates key steps in the synaptic
transmission.

To date, more than 1100 PAH variants have been identified of which a substantial portion have unknown clinical significance. In this work, we study the functionality of seven yet uncharacterized PAH missense variants p.Asn167Tyr, p.Thr200Asn, p.Asp229Gly, p.Gly239Ala, p.Phe263Ser, p.Ala342Pro, and p.Ile406Met first identified in the Czech PKU/HPA patients. From all tested variants, three of them, namely p.Asn167Tyr, p.Thr200Asn, and p.Ile406Met, exerted residual enzymatic activity in vitro similar to wild type (WT) PAH, however, when expressed in HepG2 cells, their protein level reached a maximum of 72.1% ± 4.9%, 11.2% ± 4.2%, and 36.6% ± 7.3% compared to WT PAH, respectively.

The chaperone-like effect of applied BH4 precursor increased protein level significantly for p.Asn167Tyr, p.Asp229Gly, p.Ala342Pro, and p.Ile406Met. Taken together, our results of functional characterization in combination with in silico prediction suggest that while p.Asn167Tyr, p.Thr200Asn, and p.Ile406Met PAH variants have a mild impact on the protein, p.Asp229Gly, p.Gly239Ala, p.Phe263Ser, and p.Ala342Pro severely affect protein structure and function.Keywords: phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylketonuria, BH4, functional studies, missense variants",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6628251/

At least 43 different inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) have been associated with sudden death (SUDI). To date, the frequency of IEM-associated SUDI has not been studied in Brazil. The present study sought to characterize infant mortality related to IEMs known to cause SUDI disaggregated by each of the regions of Brazil.MethodsThis was a descriptive, cross-sectional, population-based study of data obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health Mortality Information System (SIM). Death records were obtained for all infants (age < 1 year) who died in Brazil in 2002–2014 in whom the underlying cause of death was listed as ICD-10 codes E70 (Disorders of aromatic amino-acid metabolism), E71 (Disorders of branched-chain amino-acid metabolism and fatty-acid metabolism), E72 (Other disorders of amino-acid metabolism), or E74 (Other disorders of carbohydrate metabolism), which are known to be associated with SUDI.ResultsFrom 2002 to 2014, 199 deaths of infants aged < 1 year were recorded in the SIM with an underlying cause corresponding to one of the IEMs of interest. The prevalence of IEM-related deaths was 0.67 per 10,000 live births (0.58–0.77). Of these 199 deaths, 18 (9.0%) occurred in the North of Brazil, 43 (21.6%) in the Northeast, 80 (40.2%) in the Southeast, 46 (23.1%) in the South, and 12 (6.0%) in the Center-West region. Across all regions of the country, ICD10-E74 was predominant.ConclusionsThis 13-year time-series study provides the first analysis of the number of infant deaths in Brazil attributable to IEMs known to be associated with sudden death.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12887-019-1421-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Sudden death, Inborn errors of metabolism, Infant mortality",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6367785/

The present study examines the effects of antibiotic treatment in chronic LBP patients with MCs at the level of a lumbar disc herniation, similar to the previous study. It also aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of the treatment, refine the MRI assessment of MCs, and further evaluate the impact of the treatment and the pathogenesis of MCs by studying genetic variability and the gene and protein expression of inflammatory biomarkers.Methods/designA double-blinded RCT is conducted at six hospitals in Norway, comparing orally administered amoxicillin 750 mg, or placebo three times a day, over a period of 100 days in patients with chronic LBP and type I or II MCs at the level of a MRI-confirmed lumbar disc herniation within the preceding 2 years. The inclusion will be stopped when at least 80 patients are included in each of the two MC type groups. In each MC type group, the study is designed to detect (β = 0.1, α = 0.05) a mean difference of 4 (standard deviation 5) in the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score between the two treatment groups (amoxicillin or placebo) at 1-year follow-up. The study includes cost-effectiveness measures. Blood samples are assessed for security measures and for possible inflammatory mediators and biomarkers at different time points. MCs are evaluated on MRI at baseline and after 12 months. A blinded intention-to-treat analysis of treatment effects will be performed in the total sample and in each MC type group.DiscussionTo ensure the appropriate use of antibiotic treatment, its effect in chronic LBP patients with MCs should be re-assessed. This study will investigate the effects and cost-effectiveness of amoxicillin in patients with chronic LBP and MCs at the level of a disc herniation.

Implementation of nitisinone (NTBC) treatment has dramatically improved survival rate of individuals with HT1, yet recent reports on cognitive impairment in treated patients exist.AimsDescribe long-term neurocognitive outcome individuals with HT1 treated with nitisinone and protein restricted diet.MethodologyTwelve individuals with HT1 were analyzed with respect to psychomotor development and cognitive functioning using standardized psychometric tests. Plasma tyrosine and phenylalanine concentrations were also collected and analyzed, as part of the regular HT1 follow up program in our clinic.ResultsDelayed performance in Bayley scale mental developmental index (MDI) was identified in 29% to 38% of the patients assessed at different ages. At preschool age, mean full scale IQ (FSIQ) was 88 ± 16; six out of nine assessed children preformed within normal range, and one child presented with intellectual disability. At school age mean FSIQ was 79 ± 18, three out of nine children preformed within normal range and two showed intellectual disability. Repeated measures showed IQ decline over time in four out of eight patients, all of whom presented with symptoms in their first months of life. Patients that showed no progressive IQ decline were 8 months or older at diagnosis, with a mean age of 17 months. Significant correlation between Phe/Tyr ratio and FSIQ at school age was identified (r = − 0.689; p < 0.044).ConclusionSome patients with HT1 treated with nitisinone and protein restricted diet are at risk of presenting developmental delay and impaired cognitive functioning.

The study also included 45 patients aged ≥20.ResultsOur study demonstrated that only 45% (n = 74) of PKU patients knew daily Phe intake recommendations, 27% of patients (n = 41) knew the Phe content in a minimum of three out of four researched food products. Patients’ knowledge concerning Phe intake (p = 0.0181) and the knowledge of selected food products (p = 0.041819) improved with age. We did not establish such a correlation in the group of PKU children’s parents.Approximately 31% of patients and 22% of parents reported helplessness, which increased with the child’s age, associated with the necessity to adhere to the diet; 30% of patients reported feeling ashamed of the fact that they could not eat all food products. Regardless of age, children were more likely than parents to report helplessness (p = 0.032005).Among patients, 41.40% declared that they would wish to select products unassisted but their parents did not permit them to do so. The question of whether parents teach children self-reliance in meal preparation was answered affirmatively by 98% of parents and only 81% of children (p = 0.0001).ConclusionOur data demonstrated that parents’ and children’s knowledge concerning treatment recommendations and food products does not have a direct impact on attitude to the PKU diet. Limiting children’s independence in meal selection, growing helplessness in the face of dietary adherence and shame resulting from the necessity to follow a different diet observed in PKU families are responsible for shaping and perpetuating a consistently negative attitude to the diet. The care of PKU paediatric patients requires consistent, long-term family and individual therapy which may counteract the effects of learned helplessness. In regard to the educational effort, a good parent-child relationship as well as the teaching of behaviours motivating patients to comply with the diet are of great importance.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12986-017-0207-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, Diet compliance, Control diet, Education, Phenylalanine and foods",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5559804/
505,,29259526,"Go to:AbstractSince its emergence in 2012, the genome editing technique known as CRISPR-Cas9 and its scientific use have rapidly expanded globally within a very short period of time. The technique consists of using an RNA guide molecule to bind to complementary DNA sequences, which simultaneously recruits the endonuclease Cas9 to introduce double-stranded breaks in the target DNA. The resulting double-stranded break is then repaired, allowing modification or removal of specific DNA bases. The technique has gained momentum in the laboratory because it is cheap, quick, and easy to use. Moreover, it is also being applied in vivo to generate more complex animal model systems. Such use of genome editing has proven to be highly effective and warrants a potential therapy for both genetic and non-genetic diseases. Although genome editing has the potential to be a transformative therapy for patients it is still in its infancy. Consequently, the legal and ethical frameworks are yet to be fully discussed and will be an increasingly important topic as the technology moves towards more contentious issues such as modification of the germline. Here, we review a number of scientific and ethical issues which may potentially influence the development of both the technology and its use in the clinical setting.Keywords: CRISPR, Cas9, genome editing, bioethics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5733851/
506,10.1186/s13039-019-0418-4,30766616,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundIn medical genetics, diseases are classified according to the nature (hypothetical nature) of the underlying genetic defect. The classification is “gene-centric” and “factor-centric”; a disease may be, thereby, designated as monogenic, oligogenic or polygenic/multifactorial. Chromosomal diseases/syndromes and abnormalities are generally considered apart from these designations due to distinctly different formation mechanisms and simultaneous encompassing from several to several hundreds of co-localized genes. These definitions are ubiquitously used and are perfectly suitable for human genetics issues in historical and academic perspective. However, recent achievements in systems biology have offered a possibility to explore the consequences of a genetic defect from genomic variations to molecular/cellular pathway alterations unique to a disease. Since pathogenetic mechanisms (pathways) are more influential on our understating of disease presentation and progression than genetic defects per se, a need for a disease classification reflecting both genetic causes and molecular/cellular mechanisms appears to exist. Here, we propose an extension to the common disease classification based on the underlying genetic defects, which focuses on disease-specific molecular pathways.ConclusionThe basic idea of our classification is to propose pathways as parameters for designating a genetic disease. To proceed, we have followed the tradition of using ancient Greek words and prefixes to create the terms for the pathway-based classification of genetic diseases. We have chosen the word “griphos” (γρῖφος), which simultaneously means “net” and “puzzle”, accurately symbolizing the term “pathway” currently used in molecular biology and medicine. Thus, diseases may be classified as monogryphic (single pathway is altered to result in a phenotype), digryphic (two pathways are altered to result in a phenotype), etc.; additionally, diseases may be designated as oligogryphic (several pathways are altered to result in a phenotype), polygryphic (numerous pathways or cascades of pathways are altered to result in a phenotype) and homeogryphic in cases of comorbid diseases resulted from shared pathway alterations. We suppose that classifying illness this way using both “gene-centric” and “pathway-centric” concepts is able to revolutionize current views on genetic diseases.Keywords: Chromosome, Disease, Genes, Classification, Genome, Pathway, Phenotype",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6362588/

Administration of BH4 is used clinically within the management of persons with genetic BH4 deficiencies, but the BH4 molecule does not cross the blood-brain barrier sufficiently. CNSA-001 is a pharmaceutical preparation of sepiapterin, a natural precursor of BH4 that induced larger increases in plasma BH4 compared with administration of the same doses of BH4 itself in healthy volunteers in a randomized trial. Here, we report the effects of 7 days of once-daily treatment with CNSA-001 60 mg/kg (n = 6) or placebo (n = 2) on metabolites of the BH4 synthetic pathway and on biomarkers of the serotonin (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid [5-HIAA]) and dopamine (homovanillic acid [HVA]) pathways in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in subjects from this trial. There were no notable changes in any metabolite in placebo-treated subjects. Administration of CNSA-001 increased mean BH4 from 18.1 (SD 3.0) to 35.1 (10.0) nmol/L, and of dihydrobiopterin (BH2) from 2.1 (0.3) to 7.9 (1.5) nmol/L. Overall, administration of CNSA-001 had little effect on mean levels (pre- vs. post-treatment) of 5-HIAA (76.1 [SD 29.8] vs. 70.1 [23.1] nmol/L) or HVA (177.2 [66.5] vs. 184.8 [35.3]) nmol/L. One subject with low 5-HIAA and HVA at baseline responded with approximately three-fold increases in CNS levels of these metabolites after CNSA-001 treatment, with post-treatment levels within the range of those seen in other subjects. Administration of CNSA-001 60 mg/kg markedly increased levels of BH4 in the CNS of healthy volunteers, with apparently little overall effect in CNS levels of already normal key neurotransmitter metabolites.Keywords: Sepiapterin, Tetrahydrobiopterin, Phenylketonuria, Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiencies, Biogenic amines",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6700519/

The restrictive nature of the PKU diet may expose patients to sub-optimal nutritional intake and deficiencies which may impact normal brain function. A systematic review of the published literature was carried out, where possible with meta-analysis, to compare the status of nutrients (Nutrients: DHA, EPA phospholipids, selenium, vitamins B6, B12, E, C, A, D, folic acid, choline, uridine, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, iodine and cholesterol) known to be important for brain development and functioning between individuals with PKU and healthy controls.ResultsOf 1534 publications identified, 65 studies met the entry criteria. Significantly lower levels of DHA, EPA and cholesterol were found for PKU patients compared to healthy controls. No significant differences in zinc, vitamins B12, E and D, calcium, iron and magnesium were found between PKU patients and controls. Because of considerable heterogeneity, the meta-analyses findings for folate and selenium were not reported. Due to an insufficient number of publications (< 4) no meta-analysis was undertaken for vitamins A, C and B6, choline, uridine, iodine and phospholipids.ConclusionsThe current data show that PKU patients have lower availability of DHA, EPA and cholesterol. Compliance with the phe-restricted diet including the micronutrient fortified protein substitute (PS) is essential to ensure adequate micronutrient status. Given the complexity of the diet, patients’ micronutrient and fatty acid status should be continuously monitored, with a particular focus on patients who are non-compliant or poorly compliant with their PS. Given their key role in brain function, assessment of the status of nutrients where limited data was found (e.g. choline, iodine) should be undertaken. Standardised reporting of studies in PKU would strengthen the output of meta-analysis and so better inform best practice for this rare condition.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13023-018-0839-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylketonuria (PKU), Brain, Plasma, Nutrient, Nutritional requirement, Metabolism, Fatty acids, Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Eicosapentanoic acid (EPA), Cholesterol, choline, Vitamins, Micronutrients, phospholipids, compliance",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6020171/

C57BL/6 mice were divided into control, IBS, and IBS + C. butyricum groups. In the IBS and IBS + C. butyricum groups, the mice were subjected to water avoidance stress (WAS) for 1 h/d for ten days. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) together with multivariate analysis was employed to compare the fecal samples between groups.RESULTSWAS exposure established an appropriate model of IBS in mice, with symptoms of visceral hyperalgesia and diarrhea. The differences in the metabolite profiles between the control group and IBS group significantly changed with the progression of IBS (days 0, 5, 10, and 17). A total of 14 differentially excreted metabolites were identified between the control and IBS groups, and phenylethylamine was a major metabolite induced by stress. In addition, phenylalanine metabolism was found to be the most relevant metabolic pathway. Between the IBS group and IBS + C. butyricum group, 10 differentially excreted metabolites were identified. Among these, pantothenate and coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis metabolites, as well as steroid hormone biosynthesis metabolites were identified as significantly relevant metabolic pathways.CONCLUSIONThe metabolic profile of IBS mice is significantly altered compared to control mice.

In addition, the diagnostic features are discussed.Case Report:The case of a female newborn who died on her third day of life was studied at the Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Chieti-Pescara (Italy). The investigations around her death revealed a cardiac congenital malformation, seen as a rare variant of a common arterial trunk, in which the aorta was fused with the right branch of the pulmonary artery. The ascending aorta showed hypoplasia, while the coronary arteries were free of any pathological findings. The atrial septum showed a closed foramen ovale and the ventricular septum did not show any defect. Only an isolated right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation with no other cardiac abnormalities was found. The cause of death was acute respiratory failure on the third day of extrauterine life when the ductus Botalli closed. The karyotype analysis performed in this case was normal, and the fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis did not show the 22q11.2 microdeletion suggestive of the DiGeorge syndrome.Conclusions:These findings underline the value of 3-dimensional/4-dimensional ultrasound imaging when added to a fetal cardiology screening program, and the need for improvements in postnatal screening routines by using pulse oximetry in order to discover isolated vascular defects before circulatory collapse occurs, as well as to reduce the medico-legal disputes in cases of missed diagnosis.

517,10.21010/ajtcam.v14i4.15,28638875,"Go to:AbstractBackground:Whole body vibration (WBV) is a form of physical stimulation via mechanical vibrations transmitted to a subject. It is assumed that WBV induces sensory stimulation in cortical brain regions through the activation of skin and muscle receptors responding to the vibration. The effects of WBV on muscle strength are well described. However, little is known about the impact of WBV on the brain. Recently, it was shown in humans that WBV improves attention in an acute WBV protocol. Preclinical research is needed to unravel the underlying brain mechanism. As a first step, we examined whether chronic WBV improves attention in mice.Material and Methods:A custom made vibrating platform for mice with low intensity vibrations was used. Male CD1 mice (3 months of age) received five weeks WBV (30 Hz; 1.9 G), five days a week with sessions of five (n=12) or 30 (n=10) minutes. Control mice (pseudo-WBV; n=12 and 10 for the five and 30 minute sessions, respectively) were treated in a similar way, but did not receive the actual vibration. Object recognition tasks were used as an attention test (novel and spatial object recognition – the primary outcome measure). A Balance beam was used for motor performance, serving as a secondary outcome measure.Results:WBV sessions of five (but not WBV sessions of 30 minutes) improved balance beam performance (mice gained 28% in time needed to cross the beam) and novel object recognition (mice paid significantly more attention to the novel object) as compared to pseudo WBV, but no change was found for spatial object performance (mice did not notice the relocation). Although 30 minutes WBV sessions were not beneficial, it did not impair either attention or motor performance.Conclusion:These results show that brief sessions of WBV improve, next to motor performance, attention for object recognition, but not spatial cues of the objects. The selective improvement of attention in mice opens the avenue to unravel the underlying brain mechanisms.Keywords: motor performance, attention, novel object recognition, balance beam, chronic treatment",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5471459/

To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the impact of fatty fish on cognition in preschool children. The purpose of the trial was to investigate whether an increased intake of fatty fish compared to meat improves cognitive function in children 4–6 years old.MethodsThe children (n = 232) in this two-armed RCT, Fish Intervention Studies-KIDS (FINS-KIDS) were recruited from 13 kindergartens in Bergen, Norway. They were randomly assigned to lunch meals with fatty fish (herring/mackerel) or meat (chicken/lamb/beef) three times a week for 16 weeks. The fish and meat were weighed before and after the meals to record the exact consumption (dietary compliance). The primary outcome was cognitive function measured by the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 3rd edition (WPPSI-III) and fine-motor coordination measured by the 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) at pre- and post-intervention. Biological samples (blood, urine, hair), and questionnaires to the caregivers were included at both time points. Linear mixed effect models with a random intercept for kindergarten were used to analyze changes from pre- to post-intervention in the primary outcome variables.ResultsThere were 218 children included in the trial (105 in the fish, and 113 in the meat group).

This study aimed to investigate healthcare service utilization and health security of patients with rare diseases in China.MethodsFrom 29 provinces of Mainland China, 7,747 visits with eight common rare diseases who were linked to the national insurance database between 2014 and 2016 were selected as the study population, whose demographic and healthcare service information was collected from China’s national monitoring system for health service utilization of patients with healthcare insurance. Univariate analysis was performed to describe the basic statement of healthcare service, such as visit type, institution type, length of stay, healthcare insurance utilization, and the results of disease burden for different groups and its factors were analyzed by multivariate analysis.ResultsMedical treatment from general tertiary hospitals was sought by 61.4% of the patients with rare diseases. Of the total treatment cost (TTC) of 40.18 million Chinese Yuan, 63.3% was paid by basic health insurance, and 54.2% of the medical cost resulted from medicine expenditure. Demography, geography and social-economic factors, security level, and health institution situation had an effect on the TTC. The correlations between these factors and TTC were different for outpatients and inpatients. Reimbursement rate had the highest effect on inpatients’ TTC. Basic insurance was effective for providing support for patients with rare diseases that involved high costs; however, the coverage was limited.ConclusionsHealthcare insurance is an effective safeguard for patients with rare diseases; however, affordable and accessible treatment is still lacking for such patients.

Conceptually, DBS offers a cost-effective solution for multiple use cases by simplifying logistics for collecting, preserving, and transporting blood specimens in settings with minimal infrastructure. This review describes methods to determine both the reliability of DBS-based bioanalysis for a defined use case and the optimal conditions that minimize pre-analytical sources of data variability. Examples by the newborn screening, drug development, and global health communities are provided in this review of published literature. Sources of variability are linked in most cases, emphasizing the importance of field-to-laboratory standard operating procedures that are evidence based and consider both stability and efficiency of recovery for a specified analyte in defining the type of DBS card, accessories, handling procedures, and storage conditions.

Results showed that cognitive-linguistic translation explained an average of 27% and 15% of the variance in reading and writing achievement, respectively, but working memory components explained an additional 39% and 27% variance. Orthographic word form coding uniquely predicted nearly every measure, whereas attention switching only uniquely predicted reading. Finally, differences in reading and writing persisted between dyslexia and dysgraphia, with dysgraphia higher, even after controlling for Block 1 to 4 predictors.

We investigated the effects of folic acid on reduced appetite caused by the use of methylphenidate in children with ADHD.Methods:This randomized double-blind clinical trial evaluated 70 outpatients, aged between 6 and 12 years, with a diagnosis of ADHD. The children were recruited from the Outpatient Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinic of Golestan Hospital (Ahwaz, Iran) between 2016 and 2017. The study subjects were randomly assigned to 2 groups: Group 1 received an average dose of methylphenidate (1 mg/kg) plus folic acid (5 mg/d) and Group 2 received an average dose of methylphenidate (1 mg/kg) plus a placebo (5 mg of sucrose) for 8 weeks. Assessments, comprising the Conners Parent Questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, and appetite questionnaire, were conducted by a psychiatrist at baseline and then at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after the medication was started using repeated measure analysis. The data were analyzed with the Mann–Whitney U and ANOVA tests using the SPSS statistical software (v. 18.0).Results:Age and gender were not associated with the groups. Weight, height, and the body mass index were not changed during the study in both groups. ADHD symptoms significantly decreased in both groups during the trial; however, no difference was observed between the groups. Moreover, appetite was significantly improved in Group 1.

In particular, metabolomics has received special attention in the discovery of biomarkers and diagnostics. This is largely due to the fact that metabolomics provides critical information related to the downstream products of many cellular and metabolic processes which could provide a snapshot of the health/disease status of a particular tissue or organ. Many of these cellular products eventually find their way to urine; hence, analysis of urine via metabolomics has the potential to yield useful diagnostic and prognostic information. Although there are a number of analytical platforms that can be used for this purpose, this review article will focus on nuclear magnetic resonance–based metabolomics. Furthermore, although there have been many studies addressing different diseases and metabolic disorders, the focus of this review article will be in the following specific applications: urinary tract infection, kidney transplant rejection, diabetes, some types of cancer, and inborn errors of metabolism.

527,10.3390/ijms19113597,30441827,"Go to:AbstractRecent studies have established that dietary protein restriction improves metabolic health and glucose homeostasis. SLC6A19 (B0AT1) is the major neutral amino acid transporter in the intestine and carries out the bulk of amino acid absorption from the diet. Mice lacking SLC6A19 show signs of protein restriction, have improved glucose tolerance, and are protected from diet-induced obesity. Pharmacological blockage of this transporter could be used to induce protein restriction and to treat metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. A few novel inhibitors of SLC6A19 have recently been identified using in vitro compound screening, but it remains unclear whether these compounds block the transporter in vivo. To evaluate the efficacy of SLC6A19 inhibitors biomarkers are required that can reliably detect successful inhibition of the transporter in mice. A gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics approach was used to discriminate global metabolite profiles in plasma, urine and faecal samples from SLC6A19ko and wt mice. Due to inefficient absorption in the intestine and lack of reabsorption in the kidney, significantly elevated amino acids levels were observed in urine and faecal samples. By contrast, a few neutral amino acids were reduced in the plasma of male SLC6A19ko mice as compared to other biological samples. Metabolites of bacterial protein fermentation such as p-cresol glucuronide and 3-indole-propionic acid were more abundant in SLC6A19ko mice, indicating protein malabsorption of dietary amino acids. Consistently, plasma appearance rates of [14C]-labelled neutral amino acids were delayed in SLC6A19ko mice as compared to wt after intra-gastric administration of a mixture of amino acids. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to validate the potential use of these metabolites as biomarkers. These findings provide putative metabolite biomarkers that can be used to detect protein malabsorption and the inhibition of this transporter in intestine and kidney.Keywords: amino acid absorption, epithelial transport, metabolomics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6274964/

We collected medical and genomic information for developing a biobank to be used for this healthcare system. We designed a questionnaire-based pedigree-creation software program named “f-treeGC,” which enables even less experienced medical practitioners to accurately and rapidly collect family health history and create pedigree charts.Resultsf-treeGC may be run on Adobe AIR. Pedigree charts are created in the following manner: 1) At system startup, the client is prompted to provide required information on the presence or absence of children; f-treeGC is capable of creating a pedigree up to three generations. 2) An interviewer fills out a multiple-choice questionnaire on genealogical information. 3) The information requested includes name, age, gender, general status, infertility status, pregnancy status, fetal status, and physical features or health conditions of individuals over three generations. In addition, information regarding the client and the proband, and birth order information, including multiple gestation, custody, multiple individuals, donor or surrogate, adoption, and consanguinity may be included. 4) f-treeGC shows only marriages between first cousins via the overlay function. 5) f-treeGC automatically creates a pedigree chart, and the chart-creation process is visible for inspection on the screen in real time. 6) The genealogical data may be saved as a file in the original format. The created/modified date and time may be changed as required, and the file may be password-protected and/or saved in read-only format. To enable sorting or searching from the database, the file name automatically contains the terms typed into the entry fields, including physical features or health conditions, by default. 7) Alternatively, family histories are collected using a completed foldable interview paper sheet named “f-sheet”, which is identical to the questionnaire in f-treeGC.ConclusionsWe developed a questionnaire-based family tree-creation software, named f-treeGC, which is fully compliant with international recommendations for standardized human pedigree nomenclature.

Our group is evaluating the use of the homogentisic acid-lowering agent nitisinone in patients with AKU. A major biochemical consequence of this treatment is hypertyrosinaemia. Herein we report the concentration of 20 serum amino acids over a 36-month period pre- and post-treatment with nitisinone.Methods: Fasting serum samples were collected at baseline (pre-nitisinone), 3 (2 mg nitisinone every other day), 6, 12, 24 and 36 (2 mg nitisinone daily) months. Amino acids were measured using the Biochrom 30 high-performance liquid chromatography cation exchange system with ninhydrin detection.Results: Fifty patients [21 female, mean age (±standard deviation) 54.1 (15.6) years (range 25–75); 29 male, mean age 49.3 (11.6) years (range 22–70 years)] were included. Following treatment mean tyrosine concentrations increased seven- to eight-fold (baseline, 69.8 μmol/L; 3 months, 670.7 μmol/L; 6 months, 666.4 μmol/L; 12 months, 692.9 μmol/L; 24 months, 649.4 μmol/L; 36 months, 724.8 μmol/L, p = <0.001 for all visits compared to baseline).At baseline mean phenylalanine, aspartic acid and arginine were outside the normal reference range.

Recent clinical findings have suggested new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of obesity, using personalized dietary approaches. Precision nutrition (PN), also called personalized nutrition, has been developed to deliver more preventive and practical dietary advice than ‘one-size-fits-all’ guidelines. With interventions becoming increasingly plausible at a large scale thanks to artificial intelligence and smartphone applications, some have begun to view PN as a novel way to deliver the right dietary intervention to the right population. We argue that large-scale PN, if taken alone, might be of limited interest from a public health perspective. Building on Geoffrey Rose’s theory regarding the differences in individual and population causes of disease, we show that large-scale PN can only address some individual causes of obesity (causes of cases). This individual-centred approach is likely to have a small impact on the distribution of obesity at a population level because it ignores the population causes of obesity (causes of incidence). The latter are embedded in the populations’ social, cultural, economic and political contexts that make environments obesogenic. Additionally, the most socially privileged groups in the population are the most likely to respond to large-scale PN interventions. This could have the undesirable effect of widening social inequalities in obesity. We caution public health actors that interventions based only on large-scale PN are unlikely, despite current expectations, to improve dietary intake or reduce obesity at a population level.Keywords: Precision nutrition, personalized nutrition, obesity, population interventions, social inequalities in health, obesogenic environments",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469305/

Studies have reported impairments, especially for processing speed and executive functions, but there is a lack of comprehensive assessment across cognitive domains. Moreover, it is important to establish outcomes in early treated adults with PKU (AwPKU) who have better metabolic control than groups previously reported in the literature. Method: We tested 37 AwPKU with an unprecedented number of tasks (N = 28) and measures (N = 44) and compared results with 30 controls matched for age and education. Results: We found (a) group impairments, particularly in tasks tapping speed of processing and complex executive functions; (b) high variability across participants, with a sizable number of AwPKU with completely normal performance (about 38%); (c) but also a sizable number of participants who were clearly impaired (about 24%); and (d) good performance in tasks tapping verbal learning, verbal memory and orthographic processing, indicating no generalized learning impairment. Conclusion: Our results indicate good outcomes, but also that deficits are still present with current treatment policies.Keywords: Adult PKU, metabolic diseases, cognitive impairments, executive functions and speed of processing, memory and learning",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5328133/

One thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven low-risk Chinese women, with singleton pregnancy, were enrolled for the study. Alpha-fetoprotein and free beta human chorionic gonadotropin were measured for the serum as well as for the parallel DBS samples. Partial high-risk pregnant women identified by primary blood testing (n = 38) were also subject to the secondary cfDNA screening. Diagnostic amniocentesis was utilized to confirm the screening results. The true positive rate for Down’s syndrome detection was 100% for both blood screening methods; however, the false-positive rate was 3.0% for DBS and 4.0% for serum screening, respectively. DBS correlated well with serum screening on Down’s syndrome detection. Three out of 38 primary high-risk women displayed chromosomal abnormalities by cfDNA analysis, which were confirmed by amniocentesis. Either the true detection rate or the false-positive rate for Down’s syndrome between DBS and the serum test is comparable. In addition, blood primary screening aligned with secondary cfDNA analysis, a “before and after” two-tier screening strategy, can massively decrease the false-positive rate, which, then, dramatically reduces the demand for invasive diagnostic operation.Impact statementChildren born with Down’s syndrome display a wide range of mental and physical disability. Currently, there is no effective treatment to ease the burden and anxiety of the Down’s syndrome family and the surrounding society. This study is to evaluate the efficiency of dried blood spots against serum screening for Down’s syndrome and to construct a two-tier strategy by topping up the fetal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) secondary screening over the high-risk women marked by the primary blood testing to build a practical screening tactic to identify fetal Down’s syndrome. Results demonstrate that fetal cfDNA can significantly reduce false-positive rate close to none while distinguishing all true positives. Thus, we recommend that fetal cfDNA analysis to be utilized as a secondary screening tool atop of the primary blood protein screening to further minimize the capacity of undesirable invasive diagnostic operations.Keywords: Down’s syndrome, prenatal screening, dried blood spots, non-invasive prenatal testing",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367654/

A systematic search of five databases was designed to identify relevant published literature. A global overview of 1099 studies highlights the geographic distribution of OR and common OR methods used. From this collection of literature, a narrative description of the use of OR across four main application areas of global health – health systems and operations, clinical medicine, public health and health innovation – is also presented. The theme of health equity is then explored in detail through a subset of 44 studies. Health equity is a critical element of global health that cuts across all four application areas, and is an issue particularly amenable to analysis through OR. Finally, we present seven select cases of OR analyses that have been implemented or have influenced decision-making in global health policy or practice. Based on these cases, we identify three key drivers for success in bridging the gap between OR and global health policy, namely international collaboration with stakeholders, use of contextually appropriate data, and varied communication outlets for research findings. Such cases, however, represent a very small proportion of the literature found.ConclusionPoor availability of representative and quality data, and a lack of collaboration between those who develop OR models and stakeholders in the contexts where OR analyses are intended to serve, were found to be common challenges for effective OR modelling in global health.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12961-017-0187-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Operations research, Modelling, Policy, Decision-making, Global health, Health systems, Health equity, Developing countries, Low-resource settings",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5395767/

The aim of this study was to provide literature content about the anesthetic approaches used by us in patients with special needs.MethodsThe medical records of 710 patients with special health care needs treated under general anesthesia or sedation were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic data, the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, Mallampati score, anesthesia duration, anesthesia type, anesthetic and analgesic agents used, dental treatment performed, secondary diseases, and complications in the perioperative period were recorded. Patients were evaluated under five groups: Down syndrome, other syndromes, psychiatric disorders, physical disabilities, and complicated medical story.ResultsAmong the patients evaluated, 47.5% were females and 52.5% were males (mean age 15.76 ± 11.17 years), and general anesthesia and sedation were administered in 72.9% and 22.1% patients, respectively. The mean duration of anesthesia was 43.20 ± 35.85 min.

Young adults who were born preterm, might go through a different developmental trajectory and transition into adulthood than their peers. This study aimed to compare the psychosocial developmental trajectory of young adults who were born preterm with peers from the general population. Young adults from the POPS (Project On Preterm and Small for gestational age infants) cohort study, born in 1983 in the Netherlands, completed online the Course of Life Questionnaire (CoLQ - achievement of psychosocial developmental milestones) at 28 years of age. Analysis of variance by group, age and gender was performed to test differences on the CoLQ scale scores between the POPS-group and 211 peers (25–30 years) from the general population (Ref-group). Differences on item level, representing the achievement of individual milestones, were analyzed with logistic regression analyses by group, age and gender.ResultsThe POPS-group (n = 300, 32,3% biased response) scored significantly lower than the Ref-group on the scales Psychosexual Development (effect size − 0.26, p < 0.01), Antisocial Behavior (ES − 0.44, p < 0.001) and Substance Use & Gambling (ES − 0.35, p < .001). A further exploration on item-level revealed, among others, that the POPS-group had their first boyfriend/girlfriend at later age, were more often single, misbehaved less at school and smoked, drank and gambled less than the Ref-group. On the scales Autonomy Development and Social Development no differences were found between the POPS-group and the Ref-group.ConclusionsA relatively less vulnerable respondent group of young adults born preterm showed some psychosocial developmental trajectory delays and might benefit from support at teenage age.

We developed a rapid and simple molecular test for the most frequent phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, Gene ID: 5053) mutations. Using this method to detect the 18 most frequent mutations, it is possible to achieve a 75% detection rate in Italian population. The variants selected also reach a high detection rate in other populations, for example, 70% in southern Germany, 68% in western Germany, 76% in Denmark, 68% in Sweden, 63% in Poland, and 60% in Bulgaria. We successfully applied this confirmation test in neonatal screening for hyperphenylalaninemias using dried blood spots and obtained the genotype in approximately 48 h. The method was found to be suitable as second tier test in neonatal screening for hyperphenylalaninemias in neonates with a positive screening test. This test can also be useful for carrier screening because it can bypass the entire coding sequence and intron–exon boundaries sequencing, thereby overcoming the questions that this approach implies, such as new variant interpretations.Keywords: phenylketonuria, phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, PKU mutation analysis, PKU screening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6481045/

As infection in pregnant women is usually symptomless, the diagnosis relies only on serological tests. Some countries like France and Austria have organized a regular serological testing of pregnant women, some others have no prenatal program of surveillance. Reasons for these discrepant attitudes are many and debatable. Among them are the efficacy of antenatal treatment and cost-effectiveness of such a program. A significant body of data demonstrated that rapid onset of treatment after maternal infection reduces the risk and severity of fetal infection. Recent cost-effectiveness studies support regular screening. This lack of consensus put both pregnant women and care providers in a difficult situation. Another reason why congenital toxoplasmosis is disregarded in some countries is the lack of precise information about its impact on the population.

Experiences appear to be constant, regardless of the specific rare disease diagnosis. Systematically collected Australian data to support policy response on rare diseases are scarce. We address this gap by providing survey results about 462 children aged <19 years living with approximately 200 different rare diseases.ResultsOf 462 children, 96% were born in Australia, 55% were male, median age was 8.9 years (0–18.2). Four-hundred-and-twenty-eight (93%) had received a definitive diagnosis but 29 (7%) remained undiagnosed. Before receiving the correct diagnosis 38% consulted ≥ 6 different doctors. Among those with a diagnosis, 37% believed the diagnosis was delayed and 27% initially received a wrong diagnosis. Consequences of delayed diagnosis include anxiety, loss of reproductive confidence because of an ill-defined genetic risk, frustration and stress (54%), disease progression (37%), delays in treatment (25%) and inappropriate treatments (10%). Perceived reasons for diagnostic delays included lack of knowledge about the disease among health professionals (69.2%), lack of symptom awareness by the family (21.2%) and difficulties accessing tests (17.9%). Children with inborn errors of metabolism were less likely to have a delayed diagnosis compared with other disease groups (Chi-Sq = 17.1; P < 0.0001), most likely due to well-established and accessible biochemical screening processes. Diagnosis was given in person in 74% of cases, telephone in 18.5% and via a letter in 3.5%. Some families (16%) were dissatisfied with the way the diagnosis was delivered, citing lack of empathy and lack of information from health professionals. Psychological support at diagnosis was provided to 47.5%, but 86.2% believed that it should always be provided. Although 74.9% of parents believed that the diagnosis could have an impact on future family planning, only 44.8% received genetic counselling.ConclusionParents of children living with rare chronic and complex diseases have called for better education, resourcing of health professionals to prevent avoidable diagnostic delays, and to facilitate access to early interventions and treatments.

However, native or drug-loaded RBC, can be modified decorating the membrane with peptides, antibodies or small chemical entities so favoring the targeting of the processed RBC to specific cells or organs. Convenient modifications have been exploited to induce immune tolerance or immunogenicity, to deliver antibodies capable of targeting other cells, and to deliver a number of constructs that can recognize circulating pathogens or toxins. The methods used to induce membrane processing useful for biomedical applications include the use of crosslinking agents and bifunctional antibodies, biotinylation and membrane insertion.

The mechanisms by which antenatal hypoxia-ischemia causes brain injury and motor deficits still need to be elucidated. Tetrahydrobiopterin is an important enzyme cofactor that is necessary to produce neurotransmitters and to maintain the redox status of the brain. A genetic deficiency of this cofactor from mutations of biosynthetic or recycling enzymes is a well-recognized factor in the development of childhood neurological disorders characterized by motor impairments, developmental delay, and encephalopathy. Experimental hypoxia-ischemia causes a decline in the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin in the immature brain. This decline coincides with the loss of brain function, suggesting this occurrence contributes to neuronal dysfunction and motor impairments. One possible mechanism linking tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency, hypoxia-ischemia, and neuronal injury is oxidative injury.

The screening results were further confirmed by clinical symptoms and biochemical analysis in combination with the detection of neonatal deficiency in organic acid, amino acid, or fatty acid metabolism and DNA analysis.ResultsThe percentages of males and females among the 100,077 infants were 54.1% and 45.9%, respectively. Cut-off values were established by utilizing the percentile method. The screening results showed that 98,764 newborns were healthy, and 56 out of the 1313 newborns with suspected IEM were ultimately diagnosed with IEM. Among these 56 newborns, 19 (1:5267) had amino acid metabolism disorders, 26 (1:3849) had organic acid metabolism disorders, and 11 (1:9098) had fatty acid oxidation disorders. In addition, 54 patients with IEM were found to carry mutations, and the other 2 patients had argininemia.ConclusionsFifty-six cases of metabolic disorders in Jining were confirmed via newborn screening (NBS) by MS/MS. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for the survival and well-being of affected children. A nationwide NBS program using MS/MS is recommended, especially in poor areas of China.Keywords: Tandem mass spectrometry, Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), Aminoacidemia, Organic acidemia, Fatty acid oxidation disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5850921/

In Wallonia and Brussels (Belgium), audiological intervention data are not collected in the screening program, and the ages at initiating audiological care have never been assessed. This study aimed to assess the evolution in the ages at initiating audiological intervention in the context of a newborn hearing screening program implementation.MethodsThis population-based descriptive study used data from the Belgian healthcare billing database. The main outcomes were the children’s ages at the initial audiological assessment, hearing-aid fitting, and cochlear implantation. Results were compared to the same outcomes from another Belgian regional program (Flanders) that was implemented one decade earlier. Annual birth cohorts from 2006 to 2011 were included in the study.ResultsIn Wallonia-Brussels, the median ages for all outcomes tended to decrease over time but remained higher than in Flanders for each birth cohort. For all outcomes except the hearing-aid fitting, differences in median ages between the two regions became less pronounced during the study period. In 2006, < 23% of the children from Wallonia-Brussels received any audiological care before the age of 12 months and these proportions were approximately 2-fold greater in the subsequent birth cohorts. For all outcomes, early care (< 12 months) was typically delivered less frequently in Wallonia-Brussels, compared to the delivery in Flanders. These region-specific differences exhibited a decreasing trend over time, and statistically significant differences were less common in the later birth cohorts.ConclusionsWe conclude that the hearing screening program in Wallonia and Brussels promoted earlier audiological intervention among hearing-impaired children. However, milestones recommended by experts for an early intervention were not totally encountered. We also recommend collecting audiological intervention data as part of this program, which can facilitate more accurate and regular program evaluation.Keywords: Program assessment, Newborn hearing screening, Hearing impairment, Audiological intervention",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789748/

We evaluated the potential contribution of tryptophan-derived bacterial metabolites to body weight gain. The study comprised three experimental series performed on separate groups of male, Sprague-Dawley rats: (i) rats on standard laboratory diet treated with water solution of neomycin, an antibiotic, or tap water (controls-1); (ii) rats on standard diet (controls-2) or tryptophan-high (TH) or tryptophan-free (TF) diet; and (iii) rats treated with indole-3-propionic acid (I3P), a bacterial metabolite of tryptophan, or a vehicle (controls-3). (i) Rats treated with neomycin showed a significantly higher weight gain but lower stool and blood concentration of I3P than controls-1. (ii) The TH group showed significantly smaller increases in body weight but higher stool and plasma concentration of I3P than controls-2. In contrast, the TF group showed a decrease in body weight, decreased total serum protein and a significant increase in urine output. (iii) Rats treated with I3P showed significantly smaller weight gain than controls-3. Our study suggests that I3P, a gut bacteria metabolite of tryptophan, contributes to changes in body weight gain produced by antibiotics and tryptophan-rich diet.Keywords: indoles, metabolism, microbiota, tryptophan, weight gain",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6471155/

The LC-PUFAs docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid, found in high concentrations in the brain and retina, have potential beneficial effects on cognition, and motor and visual functions. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism. The treatment of PKU consists of a phenylalanine-free diet, which limits the intake of natural proteins of high biological value. In this systematic review, we summarize the available evidence supporting a role for LC-PUFA supplementation as an effective means of increasing LC-PUFA levels and improving visual and neurocognitive functions in PKU patients. Data from controlled trials of children and adults (up to 47 years of age) were obtained by searching the MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. For each selected study, the risk of bias was assessed applying the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration. The findings indicate that DHA supplementation in PKU patients from 2 weeks to 47 years of age improves DHA status and decreases visual evoked potential P100 wave latency in PKU children from 1 to 11 years old.

Therefore, new cost-effective and reliable test methods are needed. Determination of HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA from dried blood spots samples could represent one such method. Here we examined whether anti-HCV could be detected—and HCV-RNA quantified—from dried blood spots, sent by regular mail. We also investigated, if IP-10 determined from dried blood spots correlated with fibrosis progression appraised by transient elastography.MethodForty chronic HCV infected patients were consecutively enrolled. At baseline and after six months, dried blood spots were prepared from blood collected by venous puncture, dried for 4–6 hours, then stored in gas-impermeable plastic bags with a desiccator, before being sent by regular mail. At each visit, approximately six months apart, paired venous samples was obtained and analyzed for anti-HCV, HCV-RNA and IP-10.ResultsAnti-HCV was found in 66/67 of the dried blood spots. Sixty-six paired samples were available for HCV-RNA analysis. A statistically significant correlation was found between log HCV-RNA concentrations in plasma, and log HCV-RNA obtained from (P < 0.0001, Pearson’s R 0.6788, R2 0.4607). HCV-RNA, derived from DBS samples, was lower than the corresponding plasma concentration, reflected by a Bland-Altman bias of 3 with SD of bias ± 0.6472. We found no correlation between IP-10 and fibrosis progression.ConclusionsWe identified anti-HCV in 66/67samples, and quantified IP-10 and HCV-RNA from dried blood spots, dried at room temperature and sent by regular mail. HCV-RNA concentrations from the dried blood spots were lower than corresponding plasma values; a probable result of heparin coated test tubes.

The psychostimulant methylphenidate is the most frequently used medication to treat it. Several studies have investigated the benefits of methylphenidate, showing possible favourable effects on ADHD symptoms, but the true magnitude of the effect is unknown. Concerning adverse events associated with the treatment, our systematic review of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated no increase in serious adverse events, but a high proportion of participants suffered a range of non‐serious adverse events.ObjectivesTo assess the adverse events associated with methylphenidate treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD in non‐randomised studies.Search methodsIn January 2016, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 12 other databases and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional studies.Selection criteriaWe included non‐randomised study designs. These comprised comparative and non‐comparative cohort studies, patient‐control studies, patient reports/series and cross‐sectional studies of methylphenidate administered at any dosage or formulation. We also included methylphenidate groups from RCTs assessing methylphenidate versus other interventions for ADHD as well as data from follow‐up periods in RCTs. Participants had to have an ADHD diagnosis (from the 3rd to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the 9th or 10th edition of theInternational Classification of Diseases, with or without comorbid diagnoses. We required that at least 75% of participants had a normal intellectual capacity (intelligence quotient of more than 70 points) and were aged below 20 years. We excluded studies that used another ADHD drug as a co‐intervention.Data collection and analysisFourteen review authors selected studies independently. Two review authors assessed risk of bias independently using the ROBINS‐I tool for assessing risk of bias in non‐randomised studies of interventions. All review authors extracted data. We defined serious adverse events according to the International Committee of Harmonization as any lethal, life‐threatening or life‐changing event. We considered all other adverse events to be non‐serious adverse events and conducted meta‐analyses of data from comparative studies. We calculated meta‐analytic estimates of prevalence from non‐comparative cohorts studies and synthesised data from patient reports/series qualitatively. We investigated heterogeneity by conducting subgroup analyses, and we also conducted sensitivity analyses.Main resultsWe included a total of 260 studies: 7 comparative cohort studies, 6 of which compared 968 patients who were exposed to methylphenidate to 166 controls, and 1 which assessed 1224 patients that were exposed or not exposed to methylphenidate during different time periods; 4 patient‐control studies (53,192 exposed to methylphenidate and 19,906 controls); 177 non‐comparative cohort studies (2,207,751 participants); 2 cross‐sectional studies (96 participants) and 70 patient reports/series (206 participants). Participants' ages ranged from 3 years to 20 years. Risk of bias in the included comparative studies ranged from moderate to critical, with most studies showing critical risk of bias. We evaluated all non‐comparative studies at critical risk of bias. The GRADE quality rating of the evidence was very low.Primary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate increased the risk ratio (RR) of serious adverse events (RR 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.57; 2 studies, 72,005 participants); any psychotic disorder (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.57; 1 study, 71,771 participants); and arrhythmia (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.74; 1 study, 1224 participants) compared to no intervention.In the non‐comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate experiencing any serious adverse event was 1.20% (95% CI 0.70% to 2.00%; 50 studies, 162,422 participants). Withdrawal from methylphenidate due to any serious adverse events occurred in 1.20% (95% CI 0.60% to 2.30%; 7 studies, 1173 participants) and adverse events of unknown severity led to withdrawal in 7.30% of participants (95% CI 5.30% to 10.0%; 22 studies, 3708 participants).Secondary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate, compared to no intervention, increased the RR of insomnia and sleep problems (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.24 to 5.34; 3 studies, 425 participants) and decreased appetite (RR 15.06, 95% CI 2.12 to 106.83; 1 study, 335 participants).With non‐comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate with any non‐serious adverse events was 51.2% (95% CI 41.2% to 61.1%; 49 studies, 13,978 participants). These included difficulty falling asleep, 17.9% (95% CI 14.7% to 21.6%; 82 studies, 11,507 participants); headache, 14.4% (95% CI 11.3% to 18.3%; 90 studies, 13,469 participants); abdominal pain, 10.7% (95% CI 8.60% to 13.3%; 79 studies, 11,750 participants); and decreased appetite, 31.1% (95% CI 26.5% to 36.2%; 84 studies, 11,594 participants). Withdrawal of methylphenidate due to non‐serious adverse events occurred in 6.20% (95% CI 4.80% to 7.90%; 37 studies, 7142 participants), and 16.2% were withdrawn for unknown reasons (95% CI 13.0% to 19.9%; 57 studies, 8340 participants).Authors' conclusionsOur findings suggest that methylphenidate may be associated with a number of serious adverse events as well as a large number of non‐serious adverse events in children and adolescents, which often lead to withdrawal of methylphenidate. Our certainty in the evidence is very low, and accordingly, it is not possible to accurately estimate the actual risk of adverse events. It might be higher than reported here.Given the possible association between methylphenidate and the adverse events identified, it may be important to identify people who are most susceptible to adverse events. To do this we must undertake large‐scale, high‐quality RCTs, along with studies aimed at identifying responders and non‐responders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6494554/

However, due to a lack of treatments, SMA has historically fallen short of Wilson‐Jungner criteria. While studies have explored the acceptability of expanded newborn screening to the general public, the views of affected families have been largely overlooked. This is in spite of the potential for direct impacts on them and their unique positioning to consider the value of early diagnosis. We have previously reported data on attitudes toward pre‐conception and prenatal genetic screening for SMA among affected families (adults with SMA [n = 82] and family members [n = 255]). Here, using qualitative interview [n = 36] and survey data [n = 337], we report the views of this same cohort toward newborn screening. The majority (70%) of participants were in favor, however, all subgroups (except adults with type II) preferred pre‐conception and/or prenatal screening to newborn screening. Key reasons for newborn screening support were: (1) the potential for improved support; (2) the possibility of enrolling pre‐symptomatic children on clinical trials. Key reasons for non‐support were: (1) concerns about impact on the early experiences of the family; (2) inability to treat. Importantly, participants did not view the potential for inaccurate typing as a significant obstacle to the launch of a population‐wide screening program. This study underscores the need to include families affected by genetic diseases within consultations on screening. This is particularly important for conditions such as SMA which challenge traditional screening criteria, and for which new therapeutics are emerging.Keywords: bloodspot, ethics, newborn genetic screening, social implications, spinal muscular atrophy",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5485005/

During the last few years, the next generation technologies, namely whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS), have given rise to the identification of many new genes for autosomal dominant (ADID), autosomal recessive (ARID) and X‑linked forms of ID (XLID). The prevalence of ID is 1.5–2% for milder forms (IQ < 70) and 0.3–0.5% for more severe forms of ID (IQ < 50). Up to now, about 650 genes for ADID have been reported and it is expected that there are at least 350 genes still unidentified. Although the ADID genes can easily be classified according to the associated clinical findings, e. g. different kind of seizures, abnormal body measurements, an advanced selection of reasonable genes for analyses is challenging. Many different panels for ID genes have been developed for a first diagnostic step, but more meaningful is the use of trio exome sequencing in individuals with sporadic ID. Using trio WES the mutation detection rate for de novo mutations in ID varies from 20 to 60%.Further research is needed for the identification of the remaining ID genes, a deeply understanding of the pathways and the development of therapies for the mostly rare causes of ID.Keywords: Intellectual disability, Autosomal dominant, De novo, Next generation sequencing, Mosaicism",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6223758/

It has been suggested that this may alter neurotransmitter metabolism, specifically dopamine and serotonin. Herein mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is used for the direct measurement of 2,4-diphenyl-pyranylium tetrafluoroborate (DPP-TFB) derivatives of monoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of AKU following treatment with nitisinone.MethodsMetabolite changes were assessed using MSI on DPP-TFB derivatised fresh frozen tissue sections directing analysis towards primary amine neurotransmitters. Matched tail bleed plasma samples were analysed using LC-MS/MS. Eighteen BALB/c mice were included in this study: HGD−/− (n = 6, treated with nitisinone – 4 mg/L, in drinking water); HGD−/− (n = 6, no treatment) and HGD+/− (n = 6, no treatment).ResultsIon intensity and distribution of DPP-TFB derivatives in brain tissue for dopamine, 3-methoxytyramine, noradrenaline, tryptophan, serotonin, and glutamate were not significantly different following treatment with nitisinone in HGD−/− mice, and no significant differences were observed between HGD−/− and HGD+/− mice that received no treatment. Tyrosine (10-fold in both comparisons, p = 0.003; [BALB/c HGD−/− (n = 6) and BALB/c HGD+/− (n = 6) (no treatment) vs. BALB/c HGD−/− (n = 6, treated)] and tyramine (25-fold, p = 0.02; 32-fold, p = 0.02) increased significantly following treatment with nitisinone. Plasma tyrosine and homogentisic acid increased (9-fold, p = < 0.0001) and decreased (9-fold, p = 0.004), respectively in HGD−/− mice treated with nitisinone.ConclusionsMonoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of AKU did not change following treatment with nitisinone.

We linked our data to blood levels of T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) and κ-deleting recombination excision circles (KREC), determined as part of a neonatal screening program for immune-deficiencies, and representing quantities of newly formed T- and B-lymphocytes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for participants having TREC and KREC levels in the lowest quintile. Multivariate models were adjusted for postnatal age at blood sampling, and included perinatal (mode of delivery, infant sex, gestational age, and birth weight for gestational age), and maternal characteristics (age, parity, BMI, smoking, diabetes, and hypertensive disease).Low TREC was associated with cesarean section before labor (adjusted OR:1.32 [95% CI 1.08–1.62]), male infant sex (aOR:1.60 [1.41–1.83]), preterm birth at 35–36 weeks of gestation (aOR:1.89 [1.21–2.96]) and small for gestational age (aOR:1.67 [1.00–2.79]). Low KREC was associated with male sex (aOR:1.32 [1.15–1.50]), postterm birth at ≥42 weeks (aOR:1.43 [1.13–1.82]) and small for gestational age (aOR:2.89 [1.78–4.69]).

There are important evidence gaps related to the comparative effectiveness of therapies for IMD, which are in part due to challenges in conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for rare diseases. Registry-based RCTs present a unique opportunity to address these challenges provided the registries implement standardized collection of outcomes that are important to patients and their caregivers and to clinical providers and healthcare systems. Currently there is no core outcome set (COS) for studies evaluating interventions for paediatric IMD. This protocol outlines a study that will establish COS for each of two relatively common IMD in children, phenylketonuria (PKU) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency.MethodsThis two-part study is registered with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative. Part 1 includes a rapid review and development of an evidence map to identify a comprehensive listing of outcomes reported in past studies of PKU and MCAD deficiency. The review follows established methods for knowledge synthesis, including a comprehensive search strategy, two stages of screening citations against inclusion/exclusion criteria by two reviewers working independently, and extraction of important data elements from eligible studies, including details of the outcomes collected and outcome measurement instruments. The review findings will inform part 2 of our study, a set of Delphi surveys to establish consensus on the highest priority outcomes for each condition. Healthcare providers, families of children with PKU or MCAD deficiency, and health system decision-makers will be invited to participate in two to three rounds of Delphi surveys. The design of the surveys will involve parents of children with IMD who are part of a family advisory forum.DiscussionThis protocol is a crucial step in developing the capacity to launch RCTs with meaningful outcomes that address comparative effectiveness questions in the field of paediatric IMD.

She has a history of partial bicornuate uterus and had a previous miscarriage in the first trimester. Pre-conception, her median blood PHE was 462 μmol/L but throughout pregnancy the median reduced to 258 μmol/L. GMP provided 30 g/day protein equivalent (46 mg/day PHE). Total protein equivalent from PS increased from 58 to 86 g/day during pregnancy but AA provided all additional protein equivalent intake. Both GMP and AA were well tolerated with no morning sickness. Normal morphologic evaluation and adequate fetal growth with cephalic biometry near the 5th percentile was determined. The infant was born at 39.3 weeks: weight 2570 g (3rd percentile), length 47.5 cm (10th percentile) and head circumference (HC) of 31.5 cm (1st percentile). In the neonatal period, the infant had craniofacial dimorphism with metopic suture prominence. Father also had bitemporal narrowing. By 12 months of age, the infant's weight (15th percentile), length (50th percentile) and HC (10th–50th percentile) were normal although bitemporal narrowing persisted.ConclusionsThis is the first case reporting the use of GMP in MPKU. Its PHE content did not adversely affect metabolic control although it only provided part of the PS intake. Some intrauterine development delay occurred in the last trimester, although we consider that this is unlikely to be associated with MPKU syndrome or the use of GMP. More published data is essential to examine the impact of using GMP in MPKU on morning sickness severity and aversion, maternal weight gain, blood amino acid concentrations and variability of blood PHE concentrations.Keywords: Maternal phenylketonuria, Glycomacropeptide, l-Amino acids, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5650649/

Patients follow a phenylalanine-restricted diet low in intact protein, and must consume synthetic medical food (MF) to supply phenylalanine-free protein. We assessed relationships between dietary intake and nutrient source (food or MF) on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers (BTM) in PAH deficiency. Blood from 44 fasted females 11–52 years of age was analyzed for plasma phenylalanine, serum BTM [CTx (resorption), P1NP (formation)], vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). BTM ratios were calculated to assess resorption relative to formation (CTx/P1NP). Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry measured total BMD and age-matched Z-scores. Three-day food records were analyzed for total nutrient intake, nutrients by source (food, MF), and compliance with MF prescription. Spearman’s partial coefficients (adjusted for age, BMI, energy intake, blood phenylalanine) assessed correlations. All had normal BMD for age (Z-score >−2). Sixty-four percent had high resorption and normal formation indicating uncoupled bone turnover. CTx/P1NP was positively associated with food phenylalanine (r
2 = 0.39; p-value = 0.017), energy (r
2 = 0.41; p-value = 0.011) and zinc (r
2 = 0.41; p-value = 0.014). CTx/P1NP was negatively associated with MF fat (r
2 = −0.44; p-value = 0.008), MF compliance (r
2 = −0.34; p-value = 0.056), and positively with food sodium (r
2 = 0.43; p-value = 0.014). CTx/P1NP decreased significantly with age (p-value = 0.002) and higher PTH (p-value = 0.0002). Phenylalanine was not correlated with any bone indicator. Females with PAH deficiency had normal BMD but elevated BTM, particularly resorption. More favorable ratios were associated with nutrients from MF and compliance. Younger females had less favorable BTM ratios. Promoting micronutrient intake through compliance with MF may impact bone metabolism in patients with PAH deficiency.
Synopsis: Bone mineral density was normal in 44 females with PAH deficiency; however, bone turnover markers suggested uncoupling of bone resorption and formation, particularly in younger patients. Adequate nutrient intake from medical food and overall medical food compliance may positively impact bone turnover.Keywords: Bone metabolism, Bone mineral density, Bone turnover markers, Dietary intake, Medical food, Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5680279/

Most studies are predominantly focused on the separate implementation, either of whey protein or lactose, to configure processes that will formulate value-added products. Likewise, approaches for cheese whey valorization, so far, do not exploit the full potential of cheese whey, particularly with respect to food applications. Nonetheless, within the concept of integrated biorefinery design and the transition to circular economy, it is imperative to develop consolidated bioprocesses that will foster a holistic exploitation of cheese whey. Therefore, the aim of this article is to elaborate on the recent advances regarding the conversion of whey to high value-added products, focusing on food applications. Moreover, novel integrated biorefining concepts are proposed, to inaugurate the complete exploitation of cheese whey to formulate novel products with diversified end applications.

It is of particular interest in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as sleep disorders are highly prevalent and have a significant impact on both cognitive and behavioral functions. As polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for the assessment of sleep, is difficult to perform in children with ASD, ACT has become a tool of choice but has not yet been validated against PSG using state-of-the-art methodology. The main objective of this study was to assess, for the first time, the validity of ACT compared to PSG for the measurement of sleep in children with ASD. During the same night of hospitalization, PSG and ACT were conducted in 26 children (6 girls and 20 boys; mean age 5.4 years ± 1.6) diagnosed with ASD according to DSM-5 criteria and standardized diagnostic scales. Sleep parameters were total sleep time (TST), sleep latency (SL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE). To compare PSG and ACT, we conducted sleep parameter agreement analyses including: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman plots, and equivalence tests. The comparison also included an epoch-by-epoch (EBE) agreement analysis to determine sensitivity (ability to detect sleep) and specificity (ability to detect wake). According to equivalence tests, the difference between ACT and PSG measures was clinically acceptable for TST (<30 min, p < 0.01), SL (<15 min, p < 0.001), and SE (10%, p < 0.01), but not for WASO (<15 min, p = 0.13). There was a good agreement between methods for SL (ICC = 0.79) and TST (ICC = 0.85) and a moderate agreement for WASO (ICC = 0.73) and SE (ICC = 0.68). The EBE agreement analysis revealed a high sensitivity (0.94 ± 0.06) and moderate specificity (0.5 ± 0.2).

Background. Skeletal fragility is a complication of phenylketonuria (PKU). A diet containing amino acids compared with glycomacropeptide reduces bone size and strength in mice. Objective. We tested the hypothesis that amino acid medical foods (AA-MF) provide a high dietary acid load, subsequently increasing urinary excretion of renal net acid, calcium, and magnesium, compared to glycomacropeptide medical foods (GMP-MF). Design. In a crossover design, 8 participants with PKU (16–35 y) provided food records and 24-hr urine samples after consuming a low-Phe diet in combination with AA-MF and GMP-MF for 1–3 wks. We calculated potential renal acid load (PRAL) of AA-MF and GMP-MF and determined bone mineral density (BMD) measurements using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Results. AA-MF provided 1.5–2.5-fold higher PRAL and resulted in 3-fold greater renal net acid excretion compared to GMP-MF (p = 0.002). Dietary protein, calcium, and magnesium intake were similar. GMP-MF significantly reduced urinary excretion of calcium by 40% (p = 0.012) and magnesium by 30% (p = 0.029). Two participants had low BMD-for-age and trabecular bone scores, indicating microarchitectural degradation. Urinary calcium with AA-MF negatively correlated with L1–L4 BMD. Conclusion.

We evaluated the effects of a program freely distributing MNP sachets to caregivers of infants in rural China.MethodsWe conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in Shaanxi province, enrolling all children aged 6–11 months in target villages. Following a baseline survey, investigators randomly assigned each village/cluster to a control or treatment group. In the treatment group, caregivers were instructed to give MNPs daily. Follow-up was after 6, 12, and 18 months of intervention. Primary outcomes were hemoglobin concentrations and scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.ResultsOne thousand, eight hundred and-two eligible children and their caregivers were enrolled. At baseline 48% (870) of children were anemic and 29% (529) were developmentally delayed. Six hundred and-ten children (117 villages) were assigned to the control group and 1192 children (234 villages) were assigned to the treatment group. Assignment to the treatment group was associated with an improvement in hemoglobin levels (marginal effect 1.77 g/L, 95% CI 0.017–3.520, p-value = 0.048) and cognitive development (marginal effect 2.23 points, 95% CI 0.061–4.399, p-value = 0.044) after 6 months but not thereafter. There were no significant effects on motor development. Zero effects after the first 6 months were not due to low compliance, low statistical power, or changes in feeding behavior.

Focused neuropsychological tests can be used to detect such deficits and to confirm the presence of poor metabolic control in the periods between routine blood phenylalanine tests, which are rarely performed in many patients from this age group due to their low treatment adherence.We assessed the practical value of the d2 test of attention and of the Benton visual retention test for identification of teenagers, who have a high risk of brain dysfunction due to hyperphenylalaninemia. We analyzed the correlation between neuropsychological test scores achieved by 30 patients and their blood phenylalanine profiles since the neonatal period.We observed strong correlation between the Concentration Performance scores on the d2 test and the quality of metabolic control within last month prior to the follow-up visit in the outpatient clinic (r = −0.72; p = 0.0003). The mean z-score was significantly higher in patients with good metabolic control than in those with poorly controlled hyperphenylalaninemia (0.44 vs. −1.12; p = 0.00002). On contrary, the results of the Benton visual retention test did not correlate significantly with the individual blood phenylalanine profiles.We believe that neuropsychological assessment should be used in adolescents with phenylketonuria on a regular basis in order to increase the self-awareness in these patients and, consequently, to increase their treatment adherence and safety.

Background: Treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 with nitisinone and phenylalanine and tyrosine restricted diet has largely improved outcome, but the best blood sampling time for assessment of metabolic control is not known.
Aim: To study diurnal and day-to-day variation of phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations in tyrosinemia type 1 patients.
Methods: Eighteen tyrosinemia type 1 patients aged >1 year (median age 7.9 years; range 1.6–20.7) were studied. Capillary blood samples were collected 4 times a day (T1: pre-breakfast, T2: pre-midday meal, T3: before evening meal, and T4: bedtime) for 3 days. Linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate diurnal and day-to-day variation of both phenylalanine and tyrosine.
Results: The coefficients of variation of phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations were the lowest on T1 (13.8% and 14.1%, respectively). Tyrosine concentrations did not significantly differ between the different time points, but phenylalanine concentrations were significantly lower at T2 and T3 compared to T1 (50.1 μmol/L, 29.8 μmol/L, and 37.3 μmol/L, respectively).
Conclusion: Our results indicated that for prevention of too low phenylalanine and too high tyrosine concentrations, measurement of phenylalanine and tyrosine pre-midday meal would be best, since phenylalanine concentrations are the lowest on that time point. Our results also indicated that whilst blood tyrosine concentrations were stable over 24 h, phenylalanine fluctuated. Day-to-day variation was most stable after an overnight fast for both phenylalanine and tyrosine.

Despite the overall success of the screening programs in detecting congenital hypothyroidism and eliminating its sequelae and new developments made in the program design, high recall rate and false positive results impose a great challenge worldwide. Lower recall rate and false positive results may properly organize project expenses by reducing the unnecessary repeated laboratory tests, increase physicians and parents’ assurance and cooperation, as well as reduce the psychological effects in families.Evidence AcquisitionIn this review, we assessed the recall rate in different programs and its risk factors worldwide.MethodsPublications reporting the results of the CH screening program from 1997 to 2016 focusing on the recall rate have been searched. ResultsRecall rates vary from 0.01% to 13.3% in different programs; this wide range may be due to different protocols of screening (use of T4 or TSH or both), different laboratory techniques, site of sample collection, recall cutoff, iodine status, human error, and even CH incidence as affected by social, cultural, and regional factors of the population.ConclusionsIt is suggested to implement suitable interventions to reduce the contributing factors by improving the quality of laboratory tests, selecting conservative cut off points, control iodine deficiency, use of iodine free antiseptic during delivery, and use of more specific markers or molecular tests.

Although preclinical research indicates that OT modulates the functional output of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system that processes rewards, no clinical brain imaging study to date has examined the effects of OT on this system using a reward processing paradigm. To address this, we used an incentive delay task to examine the effects of a single dose of intranasal OT, versus placebo (PLC), on neural responses to social and nonsocial rewards in children with ASD.MethodsIn this placebo-controlled double-blind study, 28 children and adolescents with ASD (age: M = 13.43 years, SD = 2.36) completed two fMRI scans, one after intranasal OT administration and one after PLC administration. During both scanning sessions, participants completed social and nonsocial incentive delay tasks. Task-based neural activation and connectivity were examined to assess the impact of OT relative to PLC on mesocorticolimbic brain responses to social and nonsocial reward anticipation and outcomes.ResultsCentral analyses compared the OT and PLC conditions. During nonsocial reward anticipation, there was greater activation in the right nucleus accumbens (NAcc), left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC), left superior frontal cortex, and right frontal pole (FP) during the OT condition relative to PLC. Alternatively, during social reward anticipation and outcomes, there were no significant increases in brain activation during the OT condition relative to PLC. A Treatment Group × Reward Condition interaction revealed relatively greater activation in the right NAcc, right caudate nucleus, left ACC, and right OFC during nonsocial relative to social reward anticipation during the OT condition relative to PLC. Additionally, these analyses revealed greater activation during nonsocial reward outcomes during the OT condition relative to PLC in the right OFC and left FP. Finally, functional connectivity analyses generally revealed changes in frontostriatal connections during the OT condition relative to PLC in response to nonsocial, but not social, rewards.ConclusionsThe effects of intranasal OT administration on mesocorticolimbic brain systems that process rewards in ASD were observable primarily during the processing of nonsocial incentive salience stimuli. These findings have implications for understanding the effects of OT on neural systems that process rewards, as well as for experimental trials of novel ASD treatments developed to ameliorate social communication impairments in ASD.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s11689-018-9228-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Autism spectrum disorder, Oxytocin, Reward, fMRI",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5870086/

The management of PKU should start as soon as possible after diagnosis to prevent irreversible damage and be maintained throughout life. The aim of this study was to assess the burden of illness in PKU patients in general and in PKU patients born before and after the introduction of newborn screening in Germany.MethodsThis retrospective matched cohort analysis used the Institut für angewandte Gesundheitsforschung Berlin (InGef) research database containing anonymized healthcare claims of approximately 4 million covered lives. PKU patients were compared with matched controls from the general population within the same database (1:10 ratio via direct, exact matching on age and gender without replacement). PKU patients were included if they were aged ≥18 years on 01/01/15 and were continuously enrolled from 01/01/10 to 31/12/15. The 50 most commonly reported comorbidities and 50 most commonly prescribed medications in the PKU population were analyzed. Differences between groups were tested using 95% confidence interval (CI) of prevalence ratio (PR) values.ResultsThe analysis included 377 adult PKU patients (< 5 of which were receiving sapropterin dihydrochloride) and 3,770 matched controls. Of the 50 most common comorbidities in the PKU population, those with a statistically significant PR > 1.5 vs controls included major depressive disorders (PR = 2.3), chronic ischemic heart disease (PR = 1.7), asthma (PR = 1.7), dizziness and giddiness (PR = 1.8), unspecified diabetes mellitus (PR = 1.7), infectious gastroenteritis and colitis (PR = 1.7), and reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders (PR = 1.6). The most commonly prescribed Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) subcodes among PKU patients (vs the control population) are for systemic antibacterials (34.7% vs 32.8%), anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic (29.4% vs 27.5%), renin-angiotensin agents (30.0% vs 27.0%), acid-related disorders (29.4% vs 20.2%), and beta-blockers (24.9% vs 19.9%).ConclusionThe overall clinical burden on patients with PKU is exacerbated by a significantly higher risk of numerous comorbidities and hence, prescribing of the requisite medication, both for recognized (e.g. major depressive disorders) and more unexpected comorbidities (e.g. ischemic heart disease).Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13023-019-1153-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, Burden of illness, Burden of disease, Claims data, Statutory health insurance, Hyperphenylalaninemia",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6647060/

In addition, cases with imaging findings were identified from a literature review. The phenotypic features were determined by combining published cases with those from our database.Results:A combined total of 74 cases of ALSP and 10 cases of AARS2-L with neuroimaging data were identified. The mean age at onset was 42 years in ALSP and 26 years in AARS2-L. Cognitive and motor symptoms were the most common symptoms overall in both. Ovarian failure was exclusive to AARS2-L, present in all known female cases. Both ALSP and AARS2-L showed a confluent, asymmetric, predominantly frontoparietal, periventricular pattern of white matter disease with subcortical U-fiber sparing; pyramidal tract and corpus callosum involvement; and diffusion changes in the white matter which we have termed “deep white matter diffusion dots.” Central atrophy and corpus callosal thinning were prominent in ALSP and disproportionately mild in AARS2-L when present. ALSP also occasionally showed ventricular abnormalities and calcifications in the frontal periventricular white matter, features not seen in AARS2-L.

A single hybrid capture library preparation was used for each test ordered, data was informatically blinded to clinically-ordered genes, and identified variants were reviewed and classified by genetic counselors and molecular pathologists. We performed 2509 sequencing tests from August 2012 till December 2017. The diagnostic yield has remained steady at 25%, but the number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) included in a patient report decreased over time with 50% of the patient reports including at least one VUS in 2012 and only 22% of the patient reports reporting a VUS in 2017 (p = .002). Among the various clinical specialties, the diagnostic yield was highest in dermatology (60% diagnostic yield) and ophthalmology (42% diagnostic yield) while the diagnostic yield was lowest in gastrointestinal diseases and pulmonary diseases (10% detection yield in both specialties). Deletion/duplication analysis was also implemented in a subset of panels ordered, with 9% of samples having a diagnostic finding using the deletion/duplication analysis.

One hundred and ten cases were diagnosed based on clinical suspicion combined with laboratory confirmation by measuring their plasma phenylalanine levels using amino acid analyzer, while 3 cases were detected during neonatal screening. With the exception of the 3 cases detected during neonatal screening, all patients were clinically diagnosed and treated late. Psychometric evaluations of PKU patients were done using intelligence quotient (IQ, Stanford– Binet V), Childhood Autism Rating Scale, and Children’s Attention and Adjustment Survey. Dietetic management was applied. The results of neuroimaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain) and electroencephalography were included when available.ResultsThe overall results showed that 15.9% had hyperphenylalaninemia, 35.4% had mild to moderate PKU, and classic PKU was diagnosed in 48.7%. Global developmental delay (54.9%) and delayed language (29.2%) were the most frequent presentations. Moderately impaired or delayed overall IQ was present in 77%.

Because MC vectors lack a defined size limit, we constructed a MC vector expressing a codon-optimized murine Pah cDNA that includes a truncated intron and is under the transcriptional control of a 3.6-kb native Pah promoter/enhancer sequence.

Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a critical cofactor required for NO generation, and decreases in BH4 as a result of increases in oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. As male SHR are known to have higher levels of oxidative stress compared with female SHR, we hypothesized that relative BH4 deficiency induced by oxidative stress in male SHR results in lower levels of NOS activity in renal IM compared with females. Twelve-week-old male and female SHR were randomized to receive tempol (30 mg/kg/day via drinking water) or vehicle for 2 weeks. Tempol treatment did not affect blood pressure (BP) in either sex, but reduced peroxynitrite levels only in males. Females had more total biopterin, dihydrobiopterin (BH2), and BH4 levels in renal IMs than males, and tempol treatment eliminated these sex differences. Females had greater total NOS activity in the renal IM than males, and adding exogenous BH4 to the assay increased NOS activity in both sexes. This sex difference in total NOS and the effect of exogenous BH4 were abolished with tempol treatment. We conclude that higher oxidative stress in male SHR results in a relative deficiency of BH4 compared with females, resulting in diminished renal NOS activity in the male.Keywords: hypertension, kidney, nitric oxide, sex",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6028750/

Available crystal structures indicate a similarity in the architecture of several members of this protein family. Their molecular architecture makes these proteins vulnerable to mutation, when critical structural elements are affected. The latter preferentially involve the two transmembrane domain (TMD)/nucleotide‐binding domain (NBD) interfaces (transmission interfaces), formation of which requires engagement of coupling helices of intracellular loops with NBDs. Both, formation of the active sites and engagement of the coupling helices, are contingent on correct positioning of ICLs 2 and 4 and thus an important prerequisite for proper folding. Here, we show that active site compounds are capable of rescuing P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp) mutants ∆Y490 and ∆Y1133 in a concentration‐dependent manner. These trafficking deficient mutations are located at the transmission interface in pseudosymmetric position to each other. In addition, the ability of propafenone analogs to correct folding correlates with their ability to inhibit transport of model substrates. This finding indicates that folding correction and transport inhibition by propafenone analogs are brought about by binding to the active sites. Furthermore, this study demonstrates an asymmetry in folding correction with cis‐flupentixol, which reflects the asymmetric binding properties of this modulator to P‐gp. Our results suggest a mechanistic model for corrector action in a model ABC transporter based on insights into the molecular architecture of these transporters.Keywords: ABC transporter, folding correction, P‐glycoprotein, pharmacochaperone",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5464349/

They can be overcome by the use of biomarkers, capable of objectively assessing food consumption without the bias of self-reported dietary assessment. Another major goal is to determine the biological effects of foods and their impact on health. Systems analysis of dynamic responses may help to identify biomarkers indicative of intake and effects on the body at the same time, possibly in relation to individuals’ health/disease states. Such biomarkers could be used to quantify intake and validate intake questionnaires, analyse physiological or pathological responses to certain food components or diets, identify persons with specific dietary deficiency, provide information on inter-individual variations or help to formulate personalized dietary recommendations to achieve optimal health for particular phenotypes, currently referred as “precision nutrition.” In this regard, holistic approaches using global analysis methods (omics approaches), capable of gathering high amounts of data, appear to be very useful to identify new biomarkers and to enhance our understanding of the role of food in health and disease.Keywords: food intake assessment, integrative biomarkers, omics technologies, precision nutrition",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6567133/

Frequent blood draws can be a burden for patients and their families. Methods: We have developed a less invasive alternative testing method based on measuring αFPs from dried blood spots (DBS). The method was validated with 259 simultaneous plasma and DBS αFP measurements in 171 children (132 controls and 39 patients with BWSp). Results: The DBS and plasma measurements overlapped across the wide range of αFP concentrations independent of patient age (p < 0.0001), demonstrating the utility of this method for longitudinal monitoring. Occasional differences between measurements by the two techniques fell within standard laboratory error and would not alter clinical management. Conclusions: This novel method shows consistent overlap with the traditional blood draws, thereby demonstrating its utility for hepatoblastoma screening in this setting and alleviating the burden of frequent blood draws.

When implemented in high-poverty, urban elementary schools serving primarily Black and Latino children, it has been found to yield benefits in childhood across domains of academic achievement, behavior problems, and obesity. However, its long-term cost-effectiveness is unknown.MethodsWe determined the cost-effectiveness of ParentCorps in high-poverty, urban schools using a Markov Model projecting the long-term impact of ParentCorps compared to standard pre-kindergarten programming. We measured costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) resulting from the development of three disease states (i.e., drug abuse, obesity, and diabetes); from the health sequelae of these disease states; from graduation from high school; from interaction with the judiciary system; and opportunity costs of unemployment with a lifetime time horizon. The model was built, and analyses were performed in 2015–2016.ResultsParentCorps was estimated to save $4387 per individual and increase each individual’s quality adjusted life expectancy by 0.27 QALYs. These benefits were primarily due to the impact of ParentCorps on childhood obesity and the subsequent predicted prevention of diabetes, and ParentCorps’ impact on childhood behavior problems and the subsequent predicted prevention of interaction with the judiciary system and unemployment. Results were robust on sensitivity analyses, with ParentCorps remaining cost saving and health generating under nearly all assumptions, except when schools had very small pre-kindergarten programs.ConclusionsEffective family-centered interventions early in life such as ParentCorps that impact academic, behavioral and health outcomes among children attending high-poverty, urban schools have the potential to result in longer-term health benefits and substantial cost savings.Keywords: Markov model, ParentCorps, Childhood, Obesity, Behavior problems",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5635549/

We found Sptr expression is required in four adult neurons that express neuropeptide F (NPF), the fly homologue of the vertebrate appetite regulator neuropeptide Y (NPY). As expected, feeding flies BH4 rescues the loss of Punch and Purple in the fat body and the loss of Sptr in NPF neurons. Mechanistically, we found BH4 deficiency reduces NPF staining, likely by promoting its release, while excess BH4 increases NPF accumulation without altering its expression.

Conclusions: There is a significant percentage of children with diseases that often require specific care and there is a high probability that teachers, throughout their professional lives, have to deal with situations of vital urgency. The presence of professionals in educational centres seems to be a relevant option. These data suggest that it is necessary for nurses to establish a pilot programme for the incorporation of professional nurses in educational centres to determine its implications, benefits in health prevention and promotion issues, as well as costs.Keywords: students, health problems, life threatening, teachers, school nursing",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6266904/

Isolated MMA is primarily caused by the deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMA mut; EC 5.4.99.2). A systematic literature review and a meta-analysis were undertaken to assess and compile published epidemiological data on MMA with a focus on the MMA mut subtype (OMIM #251000). Of the 1114 identified records, 227 papers were assessed for eligibility in full text, 48 articles reported on disease epidemiology, and 39 articles were included into the quantitative synthesis. Implementation of newborn screening in various countries has allowed for the estimation of birth prevalence of MMA and its isolated form. Meta-analysis pooled point estimates of MMA (all types) detection rates were 0.79, 1.12, 1.22 and 6.04 per 100,000 newborns in Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions, respectively. The detection rate of isolated MMA was < 1 per 100,000 newborns in all regions with the exception of MENA where it approached 6 per 100,000 newborns. Few studies published data on the epidemiology of MMA mut, therefore no meta-analysis could have been performed on this subtype. Most of the identified papers reported birth prevalence estimates below 1 per 100,000 newborns for MMA mut. The systematic literature review clearly demonstrates that MMA and its subtypes are ultra-rare disorders.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13023-019-1063-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Inherited metabolic disorder, Methylmalonic acidemia/aciduria, Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency, Epidemiology, Meta-analysis, Newborn screening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6485056/

Under user selection, the instrument gathers light from either the white “flash” LED of the smartphone or an integrated green laser diode to direct illumination into a liquid test sample or onto a photonic crystal biosensor. Light emerging from each type of assay is gathered via optical fiber and passed through a diffraction grating placed directly over the smartphone camera to generate spectra from the assay when an image is collected. Each sensing modality is associated with a unique configuration of a microfluidic “stick” containing a linear array of liquid chambers that are swiped through the instrument while the smartphone captures videoand the software automatically selects spectra representative of each compartment. The system is demonstrated for representative assays in the field of point-of-care (POC) maternal and infant health: an ELISA assay for the fetal fibronectin protein used as an indicator for pre-term birth and a fluorescent assay for phenylalanine as an indicator for phenylketonuria. In each case, the TRI-Analyzer is capable of achieving limits of detection that are comparable to those obtained for the same assay measured with a conventional laboratory microplate reader, demonstrating the flexibility of the system to serve as a platform for rapid, simple translation of existing commercially available biosensing assays to a POC setting.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5614857/

are significantly associated with age in cohorts of typical and at-risk infantsdiffer significantly at 5–6 months of age, depending on the context: relating either with an object or a person.Environmental and developmental factors shape the developmental trajectories of hand movements in different cohorts: environment for infants with VIMs; stage of development for premature infants and those with West syndrome; and both factors for infants with orality disorders.The curvature of hand movements specifically reflects atypical development in infants with West syndrome when developmental age is considered.We aimed to discriminate between typical and atypical developmental trajectory patterns of at-risk infants in an interactive setting in this observational and longitudinal study, with the assumption that hand movements (HM) reflect preverbal communication and its disorders. We examined the developmental trajectories of HM in five cohorts of at-risk infants and one control cohort, followed from ages 2 to 10 months: 25 West syndrome (WS), 13 preterm birth (PB), 16 orality disorder (OD), 14 with visually impaired mothers (VIM), 7 early hospitalization (EH), and 19 typically developing infants (TD). Video-recorded data were collected in three different structured interactive contexts. Descriptors of the hand motion were used to examine the extent to which HM were associated with age and cohort. We obtained four principal results: (i) the kinematics of HM (spatial use, curvature, acceleration, and velocity) were significantly associated with age in all cohorts; (ii) HM significantly differed at 5–6 months of age in TD infants, depending on the context; (iii) environmental and developmental factors shaped the developmental trajectories of HM in different cohorts: environment for VIM, development for PB and WS, and both factors for OD and; (iv) the curvatures of HM showed atypical development in WS infants when developmental age was considered. These findings support the importance of using kinematics of HM to identify very early developmental disorders in an interactive context and would allow early prevention and intervention for at-risk infants.Keywords: infant at risk, hand movement, west syndrome, preterm, visually impaired mother, orality disorder, early hospitalization, developmental trajectories",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5826068/

Prior research indicates that individuals with PKU have substantial white matter (WM) compromise. Much less is known about gray matter (GM) in PKU, but a small body of research suggests volumetric differences compared to controls. To date, developmental trajectories of GM structure in individuals with PKU have not been examined, nor have trajectories of WM and GM been examined within a single study. To address this gap in the literature, we compared longitudinal brain development over a three-year period in individuals with PKU (n = 35; 18 male) and typically-developing controls (n = 71; 35 male) aged 7–21 years. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we observed whole-brain and regional WM differences between individuals with PKU and controls, which were often exacerbated with increasing age. In marked contrast with trajectories of WM development, trajectories of GM development did not differ between individuals with PKU and controls, indicating that neuropathology in PKU is more prominent in WM than GM. Within individuals with PKU, mediation analyses revealed that whole-brain mean diffusivity (MD) and regional MD in the corpus callosum and centrum semiovale mediated the relationship between dietary treatment compliance (i.e., Phe control) and executive abilities, suggesting a plausible neurobiological mechanism by which Phe control may influence cognitive outcomes. Our findings clarify the specificity, timing, and cognitive consequences of whole-brain and regional WM pathology, with implications for treatment and research in PKU.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, Brain, White matter, Gray matter, Developmental trajectories, Executive abilities",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6627563/

These findings were supported by claims that L-phenylalanine (Phe) fibrils have amyloid properties and can be detected using thioflavin T fluorescence assay. However, a part of Phe aggregation studies reported the opposite data, suggesting no amyloid structures to be formed. Due to the contradicting reports, the amyloid nature of Phe aggregates remains uncertain. In this work we tested Phe aggregation under conditions where amyloid formation was previously reported.

There is considerable interest in discovering the minimal sequence and active conformational nucleus that defines this self-propagating event. The microtubule-binding region, spanning residues 244-372, reproduces much of the aggregation behavior of tau in cells and animal models. Further dissection of the amyloid-forming region to a hexapeptide from the third microtubule-binding repeat resulted in a peptide that rapidly forms fibrils in vitro. We show here that this peptide lacks the ability to seed aggregation of tau244-372 in cells. However, as the hexapeptide is gradually extended to 31 residues, the peptides aggregate more slowly and gain potent activity to induce aggregation of tau244-372 in cells. X-ray fiber diffraction, hydrogen-deuterium exchange and solids NMR studies map the beta-forming region to a 25-residue sequence.

An early diagnosis, treatment, and specific medical support must be performed to prevent Status Epilepticus (SE). Seizure onset, especially in the child population, is related to specific risk factors like positive family history, fever, infections, neurological comorbidity, premature birth, mother’s alcohol abuse, and smoking in pregnancy. Early death risk in children without neurological comorbidity is similar to the general population. Diagnosis is generally based on the identification of continuous or recurrent seizures but Electroencephalogram (EEG) evaluation could be useful if SE condition is suspected. The main goal of therapy is to counteract the pathological mechanism which occurs in SE before neural cells are irreversibly damaged.

Metabolomics has a potential advantage in researching the relationship between external factors and CHD. Objective To find and identify the urinary potential biomarkers of pregnancy (including in the second and third trimesters) for fetuses with CHD based on modified gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), which could reveal the possibility of high-risk factors for CHD and lay the foundation for early intervention, treatment, and prevention. Methods Using a case-control design, we measured the urinary potential biomarkers of maternal urine metabolomics based on GC-MS in a population-based sample of women whose infants were diagnosed with CHD (70 case subjects) or were healthy (70 control subjects). SIMCA-P 13.0 software, principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, and logistics regression were used to find significant potential biomarkers. Result The 3D score graph of the OPLS-DA showed that the CHD and control groups were fully separated. The fitting parameters were R2x=0.78 and R2y=0.69, and the forecast rate was Q2=0.61, indicating a high forecast ability. According to the ranking of VIPs from the OPLS-DA models, we found 34 potential metabolic markers with a VIP > 1, and after two pairwise rank sum tests, we found 20 significant potential biomarkers, which were further used in multifactor logistic regressions. Significant substances, including 4-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid (OR=4.74, 95% CI: 1.06-21.06), 5-trimethylsilyloxy-n-valeric acid (OR=15.78, 95% CI: 2.33-106.67), propanedioic acid (OR=5.37, 95% CI: 1.87-15.45), hydracrylic acid (OR=6.23, 95% CI: 1.07-36.21), and uric acid (OR=5.23, 95% CI: 1.23-22.32), were associated with CHD. Conclusion The major potential biomarkers in maternal urine associated with CHD were 4-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid, 5-trimethylsilyloxy-n-valeric acid, propanedioic acid, hydracrylic acid, and uric acid, respectively.

The observed phenotypes comprised 43.57% classic phenylketonuria, 33.10% mild PKU, and 23.33% mild hyperphenylalaninemia, with an overall PAHD incidence of 1 in 20,445. Genetic testing was performed for 209 patients and 72 variants including seven novel variants were identified. These included two synonymous and five pathogenic nonsynonymous variants (p.S36*, p.T186I, p.L255W, p.F302V and p.R413H). The most common variant among all patients was p.R243Q, followed by p.R241C, p.Y204C, p.R111* and c.442-1G > A. Variants p.R53H and p.F392I occurred only in MHP with 19.3% and 8.0% of the observed alleles respectively. The genotypes p.[R241C];[R243Q], p.[R243Q];[R243Q], and p.[Y204C];[R243Q] were abundant across all PAHD patients. The distributions of the null allele and the three defined genotypes, null/null, null/missense, and missense/missense, were significantly different between the cPKU and mPKU patients. However, no significant differences were found between mPKU and MHP patients, indicating that other modifier factors influence the phenotypic outcome in these patients. The data presented here will provide a valuable tool for improved genetic counseling and management of future cases of PAHD in China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6244417/

Thus far, however, extensive liver repopulation by adult hepatocytes has required ongoing genetic, physical, or chemical injury to host liver. We hypothesized that providing a regulated proliferative and/or survival advantage to transplanted hepatocytes should enable repopulation in a normal liver microenvironment. Here, we repopulated livers of DPPIV− (dipeptidyl peptidase‐4) rats and Ugt1a1 (uridinediphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase 1a1)‐deficient Gunn rats (model of Crigler‐Najjar syndrome type 1), both models without underlying liver injury, for up to 1 year by transplanting lenti‐hYAP‐ERT2 (mutated estrogen receptor ligand‐binding domain 2)‐transduced hepatocytes (YAP‐Hc). Yap (yes‐associated protein) nuclear translocation/function in YAP‐Hc was regulated by tamoxifen. Repopulating YAP‐Hc and host hepatocytes were fluorescence‐activated cell sorting–purified and their transcriptomic profiles compared by RNAseq. After 1 year of liver repopulation, YAP‐Hc clusters exhibited normal morphology, integration into hepatic plates and hepatocyte‐specific gene expression, without dysplasia, dedifferentiation, or tumorigenesis. RNAseq analysis showed up‐regulation of 145 genes promoting cell proliferation and 305 genes suppressing apoptosis, including hepatocyte growth factor and connective tissue growth factor among the top 30 in each category and provided insight into the mechanism of cell competition that enabled replacement of host hepatocytes by YAP‐Hc. In Gunn rats transplanted with YAP‐Hc+tamoxifen, there was a 65%‐81% decline in serum bilirubin over 6 months versus 8%‐20% with control‐Hc, representing a 3‐4‐fold increase in therapeutic response. This correlated with liver repopulation as demonstrated by the presence of Ugt1a1‐positive hepatocyte clusters in livers and western blot analysis of tissue homogenates. Conclusion: Tamoxifen‐regulated nuclear translocation/function of hYAP‐ERT2 enabled long‐term repopulation of DPPIV−/− and Gunn rat livers by hYAP‐ERT2‐transduced hepatocytes without tumorigenesis. This cell transplantation strategy may offer a potential therapy for most of the inherited monogenic liver diseases that do not exhibit liver injury.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6312667/

In this study, we summarized the data of the patients and tried to elucidate the molecular and biochemical characteristics of Japanese Fabry patients. Gene analysis revealed various GLA mutations, including missense mutations (56.5%, 48 types); nonsense mutations (15.9%, 13 types); deletions (12.6%, 13 types); splicing defects (10.1%, 6 types); insertions (1.0%, 2 types), and insertions/deletions (0.5%, 1 type), in the patients that were tested. Amino acid substitutions resulting from the missense mutations found in the classic form patients tended to be localized in the core of the GLA protein, and those in the later-onset ones in the peripheral region. The most commonly identified pathogenic mutations are c.888G > A (p.M296I), c.936 + 919G > A, c.679C > T (p.R227X), c.335G > A (p.R112H), c.334C > T (p.R112C), and c.902G > A (p.R301Q). Among them, c.888G > A (p.M296I) is unique to Japanese Fabry patients. On the other hand, c.936 + 919G > A is a variant that has been frequently detected in Taiwan Chinese Fabry patients, and c.335G > A (p.R112H) in various countries. These are found in later-onset patients, and c.679C > T (p.R227X) and c.334C > T (p.R112C) classic ones. c.902G > A (p.R301Q) is found in both classic and later-onset form patients.

For each metabolic gene, a new computational approach can be developed for predicting a set of metabolites, whose concentration is predicted to change after gene knockout in urine, blood and other biological fluids. Both targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic approaches have been used to expand the range of disease-associate metabolites. The quantitative targeted approach, in conjunction with chemometrics, can be considered a basic tool for validating known diagnostic biomarkers in various metabolic disorders. The untargeted approach broadens the identification of new biomarkers in known IEMs and allows pathways analysis. Urine is an ideal biological fluid for metabolomics in neonatology; however, the lack of standardization of preanalytical phase may generate potential interferences in metabolomic studies.

However a recent prospective study reported a doubling of the risk of being overweight amongst 1-year old children whose mothers consumed NNS-sweetened beverages daily during pregnancy. We have previously shown that chronic aspartame (ASP) exposure commencing in utero may detrimentally affect adulthood adiposity status, glucose metabolism and aspects of behavior and spatial cognition, and that this can be modulated by developmental N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade with the competitive antagonist CGP 39551 (CGP). Since glucose homeostasis and certain aspects of behavior and locomotion are regulated in part by the NMDAR-rich hypothalamus, which is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal- (HPA) axis, we have elected to examine changes in hypothalamic and adrenal gene expression in response to ASP exposure in the presence or absence of developmental NMDAR antagonism with CGP, using Affymetrix microarray analysis.ResultsUsing 2-factor ANOVA we identified 189 ASP-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the adult male hypothalamus and 2188 in the adrenals, and a further 23 hypothalamic and 232 adrenal genes significantly regulated by developmental treatment with CGP alone. ASP exposure robustly elevated the expression of a network of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis, together with cell stress and inflammatory genes, consistent with previous reports of aspartame-induced CNS stress and oxidative damage. These genes were not differentially expressed in ASP mice with CGP antagonism. In the adrenal glands of ASP-exposed mice, GABA and Glutamate receptor subunit genes were amongst those most highly upregulated. Developmental NMDAR antagonism alone had less effect on adulthood gene expression and affected mainly hypothalamic neurogenesis and adrenal steroid metabolism. Combined ASP + CGP treatment mainly upregulated genes involved in adrenal drug and cholesterol metabolism.ConclusionASP exposure increased the expression of functional networks of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis and adrenal catecholamine synthesis, patterns of expression which were not present in ASP-exposed mice with developmental NMDAR antagonism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5862471/

The purpose of this review is to summarize recent progress, in the field of nutritional genomics as it relates to cardiovascular disease.Recent findingsEvidence from recent studies has shown significant effects of gene-diet interactions on CVD biomarkers and the development and progression of CVD. The cardiovascular effects of gene-nutrient interactions with respect to macronutrients and genes such as FTO, ACE, PPARs, TCF7L2, BDNF, MC4R, APOAs, FADS, etc. have shown consistent results across age groups and populations whereas gene-nutrient interaction effects of other genes have only been limited to specific ages, genders or populations and need to validated and confirmed.SummaryThe identification of individual genetic variation influencing diet-related CVD risk is important and may inform future nutritional intervention studies. Although there is ample scientific evidence indicating that the genetic susceptibility to CVD can be modified by diet, we are still not at a stage where this information is easily translated into dietary plans.

Study objectives were to demonstrate cytoprotective and regenerative effects of EPO in burned patients in terms of improved wound healing, reduced morbidity and mortality. This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial. The trial was conducted in 13 specialized burn care centers in Germany. Adult Patients with 2b° or 3° burn injuries were included. Patients received state of the art burn care including obligatory split skin graft transplantation. Study medication was EPO or placebo every other day for 21 days. Between 12/08 and 06/14, 116 patients were randomized, 84 received study medication (EPO 45, Placebo 39). Primary endpoint analysis revealed inconclusive results, as only a minority of patients reached the primary endpoint [100% re-epithelialization: EPO: 23% (9/40); Placebo 30% (11/37)]. Several secondary endpoints such as SOFA score (morbidity), EPO level in blood and wound healing onset revealed clinical, and statistically significant results in favor of the EPO group. Adverse Events (AEs) and Severe Adverse Events (SAEs) were in expected ranges; AEs EPO: 80%, (36/45), Placebo: 77%, (30/39); SAEs EPO: 24%, (11/45), Placebo: 24%, (8/39). Out of 84 patients two died, one per group, thus mortality was lower than expected. Results (SOFA score) indicate a lower morbidity of the EPO group, suggesting pro-regenerative effects of EPO in burned patients. Higher EPO levels might influence the faster onset of re-epithelialization in the first 10 days of the treatment.

Doxil® is a doxorubicin-containing liposome (“dox-liposome”) that passively targets drug to tumors while reducing side effects caused by free drug permeating and poisoning healthy tissues. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the hydrophilic coating of Doxil® that protects the formulation from triggering the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Evading the MPS prolongs dox-liposome circulation time thus increasing drug deposition at the tumor site. However, multiple doses of Doxil® sometimes activate an anti-PEG immune response that enhances liposome clearance from circulation and causes hypersensitivity, further limiting its effectiveness against disease. These side effects constrain the utility of PEG-coated liposomes in certain populations, justifying the need for investigation into alternative coatings that could improve drug delivery for better patient quality of life and outcome. We hypothesized that heparosan (HEP; [-4-GlcA-β1-4-GlcNAc-α1-]n) may serve as a PEG alternative for coating liposomes. HEP is a natural precursor to heparin biosynthesis in mammals. Also, bacteria expressing an HEP extracellular capsule during infection escape detection and are recognized as “self,” not a foreign threat. By analogy, coating drug-carrying liposomes with HEP should camouflage the delivery vehicle from the MPS, extending circulation time and potentially avoiding immune-mediated clearance. In this study, we characterize the postmodification insertion of HEP-lipids into liposomes by dynamic light scattering and coarse-grain computer modeling, test HEP-lipid immunogenicity in rats, and compare the efficacy of drug delivered by HEP-coated liposomes to PEG-coated liposomes in a human breast cancer xenograft mouse model.Keywords: cancer, chemoenzymatic synthesis, doxorubicin, glycosaminoglycans, polyethylene glycol",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5881748/

Basal biomarkers and anthropometric parameters were also evaluated in patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHPA) and in healthy controls.ResultsA total of 83 patients aged 4–52 years were studied; 68.7% had PKU and 31.3% had MHPA. 68 healthy controls of similar sex and age were also evaluated Metabolic control was adequate in 71.9% of PKU patients. Fasting glucose levels (mean 80.77 ± 8.06 mg/dL) were high in just one patient, but fasting insulin levels, with a mean of 12.74 ± 8.4 mIU/L, were altered in 15 PKU patients (26.3%) and markedly higher than in patients with MPHA (p = 0.035). Fasting insulin levels and Homeostasis Model Assessment Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly higher than in healthy controls and correlated with body mass index, waist circumference, age, and also showed statistically significant differences according to diagnosis and Phe tolerance (p < 0.05). Patients under BH4 therapy had lower insulin levels and HOMA-IR. A higher mean carbohydrate intake from AA mixtures was observed in classic PKU patients. The caloric intake in the form of carbohydrates was also higher in PKU than MHPA patients (p = 0.038) and it was correlated with basal insulin (rho = 0.468, p = 0.006), HOMA-IR (rho = 0.423, p = 0.02), BMI (rho 0.533, p = 0.002), and waist circumference (rho 0.584, p = 0.0007).ConclusionsThis study shows that PKU patients are at risk of carbohydrate intolerance and insulin resistance, more evident in adults and overweight patients, probably related to their higher caloric intake in form carbohydrate content.

As is the case in all invertebrates, mussels lack an adaptive immune system, but they respond to pathogens, injuries or environmental stress in a very efficient manner. However, it is not known if they are able to modify their immune response when they reencounter the same pathogen. In this work, we studied the transcriptomic response of mussel hemocytes before and after two consecutive sublethal challenges with Vibrio splendidus. The first exposure significantly regulated genes related to inflammation, migration and response to bacteria. However, after the second exposure, the differentially expressed genes were related to the control and inhibition of ROS production and the resolution of the inflammatory response. Our results also show that the second injection with V. splendidus led to changes at the transcriptional (control of the expression of pro-inflammatory transcripts), cellular (shift in the hemocyte population distribution), and functional levels (inhibition of ROS production). These results suggest that a modified immune response after the second challenge allowed the mussels to tolerate rather than fight the infection, which minimized tissue damage.Keywords: Mytilus galloprovincialis, Vibrio splendidus, hemocyte, RNA-Seq, immune priming, ROS, inflammation, apoptosis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6697025/

Moderate levels of hyperexcitability can lead to mild alterations of the EEG and are often associated with cognitive deficits even in the absence of overt seizures. Indeed, various testing paradigms have shown degraded performances in presence of acute or chronic non-ictal epileptiform activity. Evidences from both animal models and the clinics suggest that anomalous activity can cause cognitive deficits by transiently disrupting cortical processing, independently from the underlying etiology of the disease.

Included were 1,693,658 infants divided into a training or testing subset in a ratio of 3:1. Forty‐two metabolites were analyzed using logistic regression (odds ratios (ORs), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 95% confidence intervals (CIs)). Several metabolite patterns remained consistent across gestational age groups for hyperbilirubinemia without kernicterus. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and C‐18:2 were decreased, whereas tyrosine and C‐3 were increased in infants across groupings. Increased C‐3 was also observed for kernicterus (OR: 3.17; 95% CI: 1.18–8.53). Thirty‐one metabolites were associated with hyperbilirubinemia without kernicterus in the training set. Phenylalanine (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.85–1.97), ornithine (OR: 0.76; 95% 0.74–0.77), and isoleucine + leucine (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.61–0.65) were the most strongly associated.

Results: fifty-seven analytes that allow the diagnosis of more than 40 different pathologies were tested. The method showed to be linear, precise and accurate. Healthy neonates 1-18 days of age were included, 523 from Cali and 368 from Quibdo; 52% male and 48% female. Age-related differences on the concentration levels of amino acids and acylcarnitines were observed whereas no significant differences by gender were found.

Recently, riboflavin transporter genes and the mitochondrial FAD transporter gene have also been associated with MADD‐like phenotype.MethodsWe present a case of MADD identified by newborn biochemical screening in a full‐term infant suggestive of both medium‐chain acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and MADD. Urine organic acid GC/MS analysis was also concerning for both disorders. However, panel sequencing of ETFA, ETFB, ETFDH, and ACADM was unrevealing. Ultimately, a variant in the FAD synthase gene, FLAD1 was found explaining the clinical presentation.ResultsExome sequencing identified compound heterozygous variants in FLAD1: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NM_025207.4"",""term_id"":""296434316"",""term_text"":""NM_025207.4""}}NM_025207.4: c.[442C>T];[1588C>T], p.[Arg148*];[Arg530Cys]. The protein damaging effects were confirmed by Western blot. The patient remained asymptomatic and there was no clinical decompensation during the first year of life. Plasma acylcarnitine and urinary organic acid analyses normalized without any treatment.

Early diagnosis of these conditions is essential, in order to allow appropriate treatment as early as possible.Case presentationHere we report the case of a patient who was apparently healthy until the age of 20, when she presented with impaired renal function and normocytic anaemia. At the age of 34, when her first pregnancy resulted in an intrauterine death of a morphologically normal growth-restricted foetus, she was diagnosed with homocystinuria and methylmalonic aciduria due to cyanocobalamin C (cblC) defect, which was confirmed by molecular investigation. Consequently, hydroxocobalamin was administered to correct homocysteine plasma levels. This treatment was efficacious in lowering homocysteine plasma levels and restored anaemia and renal function. During a second pregnancy, the patient was also administered a prophylactic dose of low molecular -weight heparin. The pregnancy concluded with a full-term delivery of a healthy male.ConclusionsThis case emphasises the importance of awareness and appropriate management of rare metabolic diseases during pregnancy. We suggest that women with late-onset cblC defect can have a positive pregnancy outcome if this metabolic disease is treated adequately.Keywords: Pregnancy, Homocysteine, Metabolic disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6716909/

Although GBNs are broadly used, information about their adverse effects on ecosystem health, especially in the terrestrial environment, is limited. Therefore, this study aims to assess the toxicity of two commonly used derivatives of GBNs, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), in the soil invertebrate Enchytraeus crypticus using a reduced full life cycle test. At higher exposure concentrations, GO induced high mortality and severe impairment in the reproduction rate, while rGO showed little adverse effect up to 1000 mg/kg. Collectively, our body of results suggests that the degree of oxidation of GO correlates with their toxic effects on E. crypticus, which argues against generalization on GBNs ecotoxicity.

After obtaining informed consent, dried blood spots (DBSs) were collected and analyzed by TMS. If the results fell outside of the cut-off value, repeat analysis was performed. If the re-test results remained abnormal, the infant was recalled for further assessment. We performed targeted sequencing using the extended edition panel of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) to detect 306 genes using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. A total of 536,008 babies underwent NBS by TMS in three NBS centres. In total, 194 cases were eventually diagnosed with various types of inherited metabolic diseases, with an overall incidence of 1/2763. There were 23 types of diseases, including ten amino acid disorders (43.5%), eight organic acidaemias (34.8%) and five fatty acid oxidation defects (21.7%). In these infants, we clearly identified variants of disease-causing genes by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Most had two variants and others had one or three variants: 88% of gene variants were heterozygous and 12% were homozygous. There is a certain incidence of IEM in Jiangsu Province and it is necessary to carry out screening for 27 diseases.

The majority of this information is expressed by probabilistic measures of association such as the odds ratio (OR) obtained by calculating differences in average “risk” between exposed and unexposed groups. However, recent research demonstrates that even ORs of considerable magnitude are insufficient for assessing the ability of risk factors or biomarkers to distinguish the individuals who will develop the disease from those who will not. In regards to coronary heart disease (CHD), we already know that novel biomarkers add very little to the discriminatory accuracy (DA) of traditional risk factors. However, the value added by traditional risk factors alongside simple demographic variables such as age and sex has been the subject of less discussion. Moreover, in public health, we use the OR to calculate the population attributable fraction (PAF), although this measure fails to consider the DA of the risk factor it represents. Therefore, focusing on CHD and applying measures of DA, we re-examine the role of individual demographic characteristics, risk factors, novel biomarkers and PAFs in public health and epidemiology. In so doing, we also raise a more general criticism of the traditional risk factors’ epidemiology. We investigated a cohort of 6103 men and women who participated in the baseline (1991–1996) of the Malmö Diet and Cancer study and were followed for 18 years. We found that neither traditional risk factors nor biomarkers substantially improved the DA obtained by models considering only age and sex. We concluded that the PAF measure provided insufficient information for the planning of preventive strategies in the population. We need a better understanding of the individual heterogeneity around the averages and, thereby, a fundamental change in the way we interpret risk factors in public health and epidemiology.Abbreviations: AUC, Area under the ROC curve; ACE, Average causal effect; CABG, Coronary artery bypass graft; CHD, Coronary heart disease; CRP, C-reactive protein; DA, Discriminatory accuracy; FPF, False positive fraction; HR, Hazard ratios; HDL, High-density lipoprotein cholesterol; ICE, Individual causal effect; Lp-PLA2, Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2; LDL, Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; NTBNP, N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide; OR, Odds ratio; PCI, Percutaneous coronary intervention; PAH, Phenylalanine hydroxylase; PKU, Phenylketonuria; PAF, Population attributable fraction; RCT, Randomized clinical trial; ROC, Receiver operating characteristic; RR, Relative risk; MDC study, The Malmö Diet and Cancer; TPF, True positive fractionKeywords: Risk factors, Coronary heart disease, Discriminatory accuracy, Population attributable fraction, Over-diagnosis, Overtreatment, Individual heterogeneity, Multilevel analysis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5769103/

This review is intended for those unfamiliar with psychiatric genetics as a field and provides a primer on different modes of genetic variation, the technologies currently used to probe them, and concepts that provide context for interpreting the gene–phenotype relationship.

Although nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are considered safe and well tolerated, their effects on glucose intolerance, the activation of sweet taste receptors, and alterations to the composition of the intestinal microbiota are controversial. This review critically discusses the evidence supporting the effects of NNSs, both synthetic sweeteners (acesulfame K, aspartame, cyclamate, saccharin, neotame, advantame, and sucralose) and natural sweeteners (NSs; thaumatin, steviol glucosides, monellin, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, and glycyrrhizin) and nutritive sweeteners (polyols or sugar alcohols) on the composition of microbiota in the human gut. So far, only saccharin and sucralose (NNSs) and stevia (NS) change the composition of the gut microbiota.

Background: SUPPORT tools consist of 18 articles addressing the health policy-makers so that they can learn how to make evidence-informed health policies. These tools have been particularly recommended for developing countries. The present study tries to explain the process of evidence utilization for developing policy documents in the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoHME) and to compare the findings with those of SUPPORT tools.

Methods: A qualitative research was conducted, using the framework analysis approach. Participants consisted of senior managers and technicians in MoHME. Purposeful sampling was done, with a maximum variety, for the selection of research participants: individuals having at least 5 years of experience in preparing evidence-based policy documents. Face-to-face interviews were conducted for data collection. As a guideline for the interviews, ‘the Utilization of Evidence in Policy-Making Organizations’ procedure was used. The data were analyzed through the analysis of the framework method using MAXQDA 10 software.

Results: The participants acquired the research evidence in a topic-based form, and they were less likely to search on the basis of the evidence pyramid. To assess the quality of evidence, they did not use standard critical tools; to adapt the evidence and interventions with the local setting, they did not use the ideas and experiences of all stakeholders, and in preparing the evidence-based policy documents, they did not take into consideration the window of opportunity, did not refrain from using highly technical terms, did not write user-friendly summaries, and did not present alternative policy options. In order to develop health policies, however, they used the following innovations: attention to the financial burden of policy issues on the agenda, sensitivity analysis of the preferred policy option on the basis of technical, sociopolitical, and economic feasibility, advocacy from other scholars, using the multi-criteria decision-making models for the prioritization of policy options, implementation of policy based on the degree of readiness of policy-implementing units, and the classification of policy documents on the basis of different conditions of policy-making (urgent, short-term, and long-term).

Conclusion: Findings showed that the process of evidence utilization in IR-MoH enjoys some innovations for the support of health policy development. The present study provides IR-MoH with considerable opportunities for the improvement of evidence-informed health policy-making. Moreover, the SUPPORT process and tools are recommended to be used in developing countries.

When not detected on time, they can lead to irreversible physiological and psychological sequels or even demise. Metabolomics has emerged as an efficient and powerful tool for IEM detection in newborns, children, and adults with late onset. In here, we screened urine samples from a large set of neonates (470 individuals) from a homogeneous population (Basque Country), for the identification of congenital metabolic diseases using NMR spectroscopy. Absolute quantification allowed to derive a probability function for up to 66 metabolites that adequately describes their normal concentration ranges in newborns from the Basque Country. The absence of another 84 metabolites, considered abnormal, was routinely verified in the healthy newborn population and confirmed for all but 2 samples, of which one showed toxic concentrations of metabolites associated to ketosis and the other one a high trimethylamine concentration that strongly suggested an episode of trimethylaminuria. Thus, a non-invasive and readily accessible urine sample contains enough information to assess the potential existence of a substantial number (>70) of IEMs in newborns, using a single, automated and standardized 1H- NMR-based analysis.Subject terms: Predictive markers, Diagnostic markers, Metabolic disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6736868/

Four essentially different ‘types’ of screening are described, using seven terms and occasionally contradictory examples. The detection of asymptomatic infectious cases is gradually changing from screening to surveillance as part of infection control.ConclusionVoluntary screening programs rely on high participation to be effective and support and trust of the public are essential for the continued success of the public health profession.

We assessed the reproducibility of multiplexed targeted protein measurements in DBS compared to serum. Eighty-two medium to high abundance proteins were monitored in a number of technical and biological replicates. Importantly, as part of the data analysis, several statistical quality control approaches were evaluated to detect inaccurate transitions.

This profile may enable it to deplete phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, and subsequently the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin in the brain. Dopamine- and serotonin-depleting amino acid mixtures have shown promise as acute antimanic treatments. In this study, we explore the depleting effects on amino acids, dopamine and serotonin as well as its actions on manic-like and other behavior in rats.MethodsCasein glycomacropeptide and a selection of amino acid mixtures were administered orally at 2, 4, or 8 h or for 1 week chronically. Amino acid and monoamine levels were measured in plasma and brain and behavior was assessed in the amphetamine-hyperlocomotion, forced swim, prepulse inhibition, and elevated plus maze tests.ResultsCasein glycomacropeptide induced a time-dependent reduction in tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in brain and plasma which was augmented by supplementing with leucine. Casein glycomacropeptide +leucine reduced dopamine in the frontal cortex and serotonin in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and striatum after 2 and 4 h.

LNAA passage into the brain is primarily mediated by the complex and dynamic interactions between various solute carrier (SLC) transporters expressed in the neurovascular unit (NVU), among which SLC7A5/LAT1 is considered to be the major contributor in microvascular brain endothelial cells (MBEC). The LAT1-mediated trans-endothelial transport of LNAAs, however, could not be characterized precisely by available in vitro and in vivo standard methods so far. To circumvent these limitations, we have incorporated published in vivo data of rat brain into a robust computational model of NVU-LNAA homeostasis, allowing us to evaluate hypotheses concerning LAT1-mediated trans-endothelial transport of LNAAs across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We show that accounting for functional polarity of MBECs with either asymmetric LAT1 distribution between membranes and/or intrinsic LAT1 asymmetry with low intraendothelial binding affinity is required to reproduce the experimentally measured brain ISF response to intraperitoneal (IP) L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine injection. On the basis of these findings, we have also investigated the effect of IP administrated L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine on the dynamics of LNAAs in MBECs, astrocytes and neurons. Finally, the computational model was shown to explain the trans-stimulation of LNAA uptake across the BBB observed upon ISF perfusion with a competitive LAT1 inhibitor.Keywords: blood brain barrier, neurovascular unit, amino acid transporter, large neutral amino acid, SLC7A5/LAT1",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5859092/

By analysis of more than 600 metabolites in the Oat3KO (Oat3 knockout) by LC/MS, we demonstrate OAT3 involvement in the movement of gut microbiome products, key metabolites, and signaling molecules, including those flowing through the gut–liver–kidney axis. Major pathways affected included those involved in metabolism of bile acids, flavonoids, nutrients, amino acids (including tryptophan-derivatives that are uremic toxins), and lipids. OAT3 is also critical in elimination of liver-derived phase II metabolites, particularly those undergoing glucuronidation. Analysis of physicochemical features revealed nine distinct metabolite groups; at least one member of most clusters has been previously validated in transport assays. In contrast to drugs interacting with the OATs, endogenous metabolites accumulating in the Oat1KO (Oat1 knockout) versus Oat3KO have distinct differences in their physicochemical properties; they are very different in size, number of rings, hydrophobicity, and molecular complexity. Consistent with the Remote Sensing and Signaling Hypothesis, the data support the importance of the OAT transporters in inter-organ and inter-organismal remote communication via transporter-mediated movement of key metabolites and signaling molecules (e.g. gut microbiome–to–intestine–to–blood–to–liver–to–kidney–to–urine). We discuss the possibility of an intimate connection between OATs and metabolite sensing and signaling pathways (e.g. bile acids). Furthermore, the metabolomics and pathway analysis support the view that OAT1 plays a greater role in kidney proximal tubule metabolism and OAT3 appears relatively more important in systemic metabolism, modulating levels of metabolites flowing through intestine, liver, and kidney.Keywords: drug transport, kidney, multidrug transporter, renal physiology, xenobiotic, OAT3, kidney drug transport, organic anion, solute carrier, uremic toxin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5612110/

Eighteen children with severe CH and 21 healthy controls underwent a battery of behavioral measures of hearing, language and communication, along with diffusion MR imaging. Tract-based spatial statistics were performed on standard diffusion parameters of fractional anisotropy and diffusivity metrics. Microscopic diffusion anisotropy mapping based on the Spherical Mean Technique was also used to evaluate biologically specific metrics. Compared with age-matched controls, children with severe CH had poorer hearing and communication skills, albeit generally within normal limits. Children with severe CH had fractional anisotropy that was significantly lower in the cerebellum, bilateral thalami and right temporal lobe, and radial diffusivity that was significantly higher in the cerebellum and bilateral thalami. Microscopic fractional anisotropy and intra-neurite volume fraction were also significantly decreased, and transverse microscopic diffusivity was significantly increased, in the CH group in areas including the cerebellum, thalamus, occipital lobe, and corpus callosum, and in the white matter adjacent to sensorimotor cortex, particularly in the left hemisphere. Significant and widespread correlations were observed between behavioral measures and measures of white matter microstructural integrity in children with CH.

Many studies have documented the outcome of maternal PKU infants, but very little has been reported about the experiences of women of reproductive age with PKU, particularly about their psychosexual development, pre-conception, pregnancy and postnatal experience.MethodsIn the UK, in a subsection of an online questionnaire conducted by the National Society for PKU (NSPKU) about living with PKU, women aged 18 years and over completed 9 closed questions about their pre-conception, pregnancy and post-natal experiences and an open-ended question on their reproductive health.Results300 women aged 18 years and over with PKU completed this questionnaire with 37% (n = 111/300) of women already having children. 56% (n = 71/128) of pregnancies were planned and a further 18% (n = 23/128) of women had both planned and unplanned pregnancies. Most women (73%, n = 200/273) expressed concerns, fears and distress about pregnancy and two thirds of women who had at least one pregnancy stated that having PKU made pregnancy more stressful and difficult. 60% (n = 164/273) were concerned that they may cause harm to a baby, 58% (n = 159/273) worried about their ability to manage a strict diet during pregnancy, 54% (n = 147/273) had anxiety about their ability to maintain blood Phe within target range, and 48% (n = 132/273) feared having an unplanned pregnancy.Postnatally, 48% (n = 45/93) had low mood or sadness, 41% (n = 38/93) were depressed, 34% (n = 32/93) felt unable to cope, 33% (n = 31/93) said they could not manage their PKU and care for their baby, 14% (n = 13/93) struggled with child care needs and 4% (n = 4/94) worried they might hurt themselves or their baby through being unable to manage their diet.ConclusionsMany women with PKU have unmet sexual and reproductive health needs.

Background: Several studies have highlighted disturbance of redox homeostasis in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) which may be associated with neurological disorders observed in patients, especially during adulthood when phenylalanine restrictive diets are not maintained. The aim of this study was to assess the antioxidant profile in a cohort of PKU patients in comparison to the controls and to evaluate its relation to biochemical parameters especially phenylalaninemia.
Methods: We measured RNA expression of 22 antioxidant genes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in white blood cells of 10 PKU patients and 10 age- and gender-matched controls. We also assessed plasma amino acids, vitamins, oligo-elements, and urinary organic acids concentrations. Then we evaluated the relationship between redox status and biochemical parameters.
Results: In addition to expected biochemical disturbances, we highlighted a significant global decrease of antioxidant genes expression in PKU patients in comparison to the controls. This global decrease of antioxidant genes expression, including various isoforms of peroxiredoxins, glutaredoxins, glutathione peroxidases, and superoxide dismutases, was significantly correlated to hyperphenylalaninemia.
Conclusion: This study is the first to evaluate the expression of 22 antioxidant genes in white blood cells regarding biochemical parameters in PKU. These findings highlight the association of hyperphenylalaninemia with antioxidant genes expression. New experiments to specify the role of oxidative stress in PKU pathogenesis may be useful in suggesting new recommendations in PKU management and new therapeutic trials based on antioxidant defenses.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this chapter (doi:10.1007/8904_2017_16) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, PKU, Redox status, RNA antioxidant profile",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5740050/

These amino acids and their metabolism are linked to the synthesis of a variety of secondary metabolites, a subset of which are involved in numerous anabolic pathways responsible for the synthesis of pigment compounds, plant hormones and biological polymers, to name a few. In addition, these metabolites derived from the AAA pathways mediate the transmission of nervous signals, quench reactive oxygen species in the brain, and are involved in the vast palette of animal coloration among others pathways. The AAA and metabolites derived from them also have integral roles in the health of both plants and animals. This review delineates the de novo biosynthesis of the AAA by microbes and plants, and the branching out of AAA metabolism into major secondary metabolic pathways in plants such as the phenylpropanoid pathway. Organisms that do not possess the enzymatic machinery for the de novo synthesis of AAA must obtain these primary metabolites from their diet. Therefore, the metabolism of AAA by the host animal and the resident microflora are important for the health of all animals. In addition, the AAA metabolite-mediated host-pathogen interactions in general, as well as potential beneficial and harmful AAA-derived compounds produced by gut bacteria are discussed. Apart from the AAA biosynthetic pathways in plants and microbes such as the shikimate pathway and the tryptophan pathway, this review also deals with AAA catabolism in plants, AAA degradation via the monoamine and kynurenine pathways in animals, and AAA catabolism via the 3-aryllactate and kynurenine pathways in animal-associated microbes. Emphasis will be placed on structural and functional aspects of several key AAA-related enzymes, such as shikimate synthase, chorismate mutase, anthranilate synthase, tryptophan synthase, tyrosine aminotransferase, dopachrome tautomerase, radical dehydratase, and type III CoA-transferase.

Both groups of children ate significantly more sweets, sweetened drinks and potato fries than their parents but differences were greater for children with PKU who also consumed more high carbohydrate (low protein) staple foods such as bread and pasta, and more sweet snacks such as biscuits than their parents. Non-PKU control children's food choices were closer to their parent's choices.ConclusionsIn PKU, parental food choices and their food neophobia have limited influence on their children's eating habits. Food neophobia in children with PKU may be associated with fear of eating unfamiliar foods potentially containing a source of protein or aspartame.

This is as true of nutrition-based intervention and prevention strategies as it is for pharmacotherapies and pharmaceutical-oriented prevention strategies. Essentially, technological breakthroughs have enabled researchers to probe an individual’s unique genetic, biochemical, physiological, behavioral and exposure profile, allowing them to identify very specific and often nuanced factors that an individual might possess that may make it more or less likely that he or she will respond favorably to a particular intervention (e.g., nutrient supplementation) or disease prevention strategy (e.g., specific diet). However, as compelling and intuitive as personalized nutrition might be in the current era in which data-intensive biomedical characterization of individuals is possible, appropriately and objectively vetting personalized nutrition strategies is not trivial and will require novel study designs and data analytical methods. These designs and methods must consider a very integrated use of the multiple contemporary biomedical assays and technologies that motivate them, which adds to their complexity. Single subject or ‘N-of-1’ trials can be used to assess the utility of personalized interventions and, in addition, can be crafted in such a way as to accommodate the necessary integrated use of many emerging biomedical technologies and assays. In this review we consider the motivation, design and implementation of N-of-1 trials in translational nutrition research that are meant to assess the utility of personalized nutritional strategies. We provide a number of example studies, discuss appropriate analytical methods given the complex data they will generate and require, and consider how such studies could leverage integration of various biomarker assays and clinical endpoints.

The quantified detection (cell proliferation detection and glycosaminoglycan (GAG)/type II collagen (Col-II)) content was respectively determined by cell counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) and dimethylmethylene blue (DMB)/Col-II secretion determination) and qualitative detection (acridine orange/ethidium bromide, hematoxylin-eosin, alcian blue, safranin-O, and immunohistochemistry staining) of these microencapsulated cells were evaluated. Results showed that microencapsulated C5.18 cells under three-dimensional microgravity conditions promoted cells to form large cell aggregates within 20 days by using bFGF, which provided the possibility for cartilage tissue constructs in vitro. It could be found from the cell viability (cell proliferation) and synthesis (content of GAG and Col-II) results that microencapsulated cells had a better cell proliferation under 3D micro-gravity conditions using bFGF than under 2D conditions (including static and shaking conditions). We anticipate that these results will be a benefit for the design and construction of cartilage regeneration in future tissue engineering applications.Keywords: 3D micro-gravity, cartilage tissue, bFGF, artificial cells, microcapsules",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6473345/

Though early and continuously treated PKU (ETPKU) patients exhibit normal IQ, their cognitive outcome remains suboptimal. In this longitudinal study, we aimed at assessing the determinants of IQ subscales and quality of metabolic control in ETPKU children.We collected blood Phe levels, numbers of blood samples for Phe determination, parents' socio-professional categories and school achievement data of 39 classical and moderate ETPKU patients who underwent two cognitive evaluations performed by the same neuropsychologist (at 6.5 and 10y of mean age). We then sought to evaluate the determinants of 1) the changes in their IQ between the two testings (delta IQ) and 2) the quality of metabolic control (evaluated by the median Phe levels during the year before the second test) with multivariate regression analysis.Though in the normal range, mean total IQ slightly decreased between the two evaluations, and we observed a better verbal than performance outcome. Modeling the determining factors of the delta IQ, we found a significant influence of the number of blood samples (β = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.13 to 0.79, p < 0.01) and the moderate type of PKU (β = 12.40, 95%CI = 3.69 to 21.11, p < 0.01) on verbal outcome.

A total of 112 infants with unexplained developmental delay were included in the study, and the required information was taken from their parents by direct interview. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was done in collaboration with MedLabs’ Referral Laboratory in Amman, Jordan.ResultsTwenty (17.9%) cases had abnormal MS/MS. Disorders of amino acid metabolism represented the majority of IEM (10 cases) in which phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease were the most common (found in five cases each). Organic and fatty acid metabolisms were found in five and two cases, respectively. Most cases of IEM had a positive family history and consanguinity, however, family history was the only significant factor (p < 0.001).ConclusionsA high rate of IEM was detected in children with unexplained developmental delay in Misan. A high clinical suspicion with positive family history and consanguinity supported by the MS/MS results played an essential role in the diagnosis.

The largest decrement in AL amyloidosis patients was related to General Health (Δ = 9.7; p < 0.001). With the exception of Bodily Pain and Mental Health, differences were also clinically meaningful based on established clinically minimal important differences.

To achieve this goal, we propose a metacognitive approach that integrates basic science with the humanistic and health system aspects of medical education.Intervention:During the week, via problem-based learning and lectures, first-year medical students were taught the basic science underlying a disease. Each Friday, a patient with the disease spoke to the class. Students then wrote illness scripts, which required them to metacognitively reflect not only on disease pathophysiology, complications, and treatments but also on the humanistic and health system issues revealed during the patient encounter. Evaluation of the intervention was conducted by measuring results on course exams and national board exams and analyzing free responses on the illness scripts and student course feedback. The course exams and National Board of Medical Examiners questions were divided into 3 categories: content covered in lecture, problem-based learning, or patient + illness script. Comparisons were made using Student t-test. Free responses were inductively analyzed using grounded theory methodology.Context:This curricular intervention was implemented during the first 13-week basic science course of medical school.

Much less progress has been made in identifying inherited variants, even though the disorder itself is familial in the majority of cases. The objective of this study was to identify chromosomal regions that harbor inherited variants increasing the risk for ASD using an approach that examined both ASD and the broad autism phenotype (BAP) among a unique sample of extended pedigrees.MethodsASD and BAP were assessed using standardized tools in 28 pedigrees from Canada and the USA, each with at least three ASD-diagnosed individuals from two nuclear families. Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed using the posterior probability of linkage (PPL) statistic, a quasi-Bayesian method that provides strength of evidence for or against linkage in an essentially model-free manner, with outcomes on the probability scale.ResultsThe results confirm appreciable interfamilial heterogeneity as well as a high level of intrafamilial heterogeneity. Both ASD and combined ASD/BAP specific loci are apparent.ConclusionsInclusion of subclinical phenotypes such as BAP should be more widely employed in genetic studies of ASD as a way of identifying inherited genetic variants for the disorder.

Almost 80% of children with health disorders lack the developmental skills to take full advantage of school-based education relative to 27% of children without a health disorder. In Canada, there is currently a dearth of nationally representative data on the social determinants of early childhood development for children with health disorders. Evidence from Canada and other countries indicate that poorer developmental outcomes in typically developing children are associated with lower socioeconomic status (SES). However, to date, it is not known whether this relationship is stronger among children with health disorders. The study’s objectives are to estimate the prevalence and to investigate social determinants of developmental outcomes for young children with health disorders, using the Early Development Instrument (EDI).Methods and analysisStudy objectives will be achieved through three steps. First, using existing EDI data for 10 provinces and 2 territories collected from 2004 to 2015, we will investigate differences in developmental health outcomes among children with identified health disorders. Second, population-level EDI data will be linked with neighbourhood sociodemographic census data to explore associations between socioeconomic characteristics and rates of specific diagnoses among children aged 5–6 years, including trends over time. Third, for 3 of these 12 regions, additional health and/or education databases will be linked at an individual level. These data will be used to establish differences in EDI outcomes in relation to the age-of-onset of diagnosis, and presence of intervention or treatment.Ethics and disseminationStudy methodologies have been approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board. The results of the analyses of developmental health outcomes for children with health disorders combined with SES will have implications for both health service delivery and school-based intervention strategies.

Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) serves to illustrate the challenges, benefits and pitfalls associated with screening for ultra-rare inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs).A comprehensive, non-systematic review of published information from NP-C screening studies was conducted, focusing on diagnostic methods and study designs that have been employed to date. As a key part of this analysis, data from both successful studies (where cases were positively identified) and unsuccessful studies (where the chosen approach failed to identify any cases) were included alongside information from our own experiences gained from the planning and execution of screening for NP-C. On this basis, best-practice recommendations for ultra-rare IEM screening are provided. Twenty-six published screening studies were identified and categorised according to study design into four groups: 1) prospective patient cohort and family-based secondary screenings (18 studies); 2) analyses of archived ‘biobank’ materials (one study); 3) medical chart review and bioinformatics data mining (five studies); and 4) newborn screening (two studies). NPC1/NPC2 sequencing was the most common primary screening method (Sanger sequencing in eight studies and next-generation sequencing [gene panel or exome sequencing] in five studies), followed by biomarker analyses (usually oxysterols) and clinical surveillance.ConclusionsHistorically, screening for NP-C has been based on single-patient studies, small case series, and targeted cohorts, but the emergence of new diagnostic methods over the last 5–10 years has provided opportunities to screen for NP-C on a larger scale. Combining clinical, biomarker and genetic diagnostic methods represents the most effective way to identify NP-C cases, while reducing the likelihood of misdiagnosis.

Few studies have evaluated health utilities for rare conditions; even fewer have incorporated disutility that may be experienced by caregivers. This study aimed to (1) estimate health utilities for three rare conditions currently recommended for newborn screening at the state or federal level, and (2) estimate the disutility, or spillover, experienced by parents of patients diagnosed with a rare, heritable disorder.MethodsA stated-preference survey using a time trade-off approach elicited health utilities for Krabbe disease, phenylketonuria, and Pompe disease at varying stages (mild, moderate, severe) and onset of disease symptoms (infancy, childhood, and adulthood). We recruited respondents from a nationally representative community sample (n = 862). Respondents valued disease specific health states in three consecutive question frames: (1) adult health state (> = 18 years of age), (2) child health state (< 18 years of age), and (3) as a parent of a child with a condition (parent spillover state). Corresponding mean utilities were calculated for plausible disease states in adulthood and childhood. Mean disutility was estimated for parental spillover. Predictors of utilities were evaluated using a negative binomial regression model.ResultsMore severe conditions and infant health states received lower estimated utility and greater estimated disutility among parents. Conditions with the lowest estimated health utilities were severe infantile Pompe disease (0.40, CI: 0.34–0.46) and infantile Krabbe disease (0.37, CI: 0.32–0.43). Disutility was evident for all conditions evaluated (range: 0.07–0.19).ConclusionsRare childhood conditions are associated with substantial estimated losses in quality of life.

Here, by positional cloning, we report that the 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) gene, encoding a key enzyme of BH4 biosynthesis, is responsible for the alc (albino C) mutation that displays pale body color, head shaking, and eventually lethality after the first molting in silkworm. Compared to wild type, the alc mutant produced more substrates (phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr)) and generated less DOPA and dopamine. Application of 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) to block BH4 synthesis in the wild type effectively produced the alc-like phenotype, while BH4 supplementation rescued the defective body color and lethal phenotype in both alc and DAHP-treated individuals. The detection of gene expressions and metabolic substances after drugs treatments in alc and normal individuals imply that silkworms and humans have a high similarity in the drugs metabolic features and the gene pathway related to BH4 and the dopamine biosynthesis.

Amid this new success, it is prudent to recall that the field of gene therapy experienced tragic setbacks in 1999 and 2002 because of the serious adverse events related to retroviral and adenoviral gene delivery in two clinical trials that resulted in the death of two patients. In both cases, the toxicity observed in humans had been documented to occur in animal models. However, these toxicities were either undetected or underappreciated before they arose in humans. rAAVs have been tested extensively in animals and animal models of disease, largely without adverse events, except for transient elevation in liver enzymes in some patients. However, a small but growing number of murine studies have documented that adeno-associated viral gene delivery can result in insertional mutagenesis. Herein, the aggregate data are reviewed from multiple murine studies where genotoxicity associated with rAAV treatment has been observed.

Background: Phenylketonuria as the most common genetic metabolic disorder is the result of disruption of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. This study was carried out to explore the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutation status of Iranian phenylketonuria patients.

Methods: Blood samples were collected from 30 patients, and hot spot areas of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, including exons 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12 were studied through polymerase chain reaction and sequencing techniques.

Results: Eight different mutations, including 5 missense mutations, 1 splice mutation, 1 nonsense mutation, and 1 Silent/Splice mutation were detected. These mutations were R243X, R261Q, R261X, P281L, R241C, V399V, E280K, and IVS11+1G>C. V399V and R241C were reported for the first time in Iranian population. Three polymorphisms including Q232Q, V245V and L385L and 3 novel intronic variants including IVS10-15A>C, IVS6+44T>G, and IVS6+36 T>G were also detected in this study.

Conclusion: The results of this study prove the heterogeneous status of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutations in the Iranian population, which can be useful in carrier testing and genetic counseling.

Cystine and theanine were reported to attenuate some chemotherapy-associated AEs, and are also expected to attenuate the AEs caused by capecitabine treatment. Therefore, our present study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of cystine/theanine therapy in patients with colorectal cancer undergoing capecitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.Methods and analysisA multi-institutional, prospective, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II trial is being planned. Patients with colorectal cancer treated with capecitabine as an adjuvant chemotherapy will be randomised into either the cystine/theanine group (n=50) or placebo group (n=50). Data will be collected during four courses of capecitabine therapy. The primary endpoint will be incidence rate of diarrhoea of grade 1 or higher in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) v.4.0, Japanese Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) version. The secondary endpoints are incidence rates of other AEs (CTCAE v.4.0-JCOG), scores of the Japanese version of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire module for all patients with cancer (QLQ-C30) and for patients with colorectal cancer (QLQ-CR29), incidence rate of HFS according to the HFS grading scale, protocol adherence, completion rate of four courses of capecitabine therapy and the proportion of completion without delay or dose reduction, time to completion of four courses of capecitabine and total dose of capecitabine. A sample size of 100 patients will be analysed between November 2016 and April 2018.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval was obtained at all participating institutions.

However, HNF1α is involved in many other metabolic pathways with relevance for monogenic or polygenic type 2 diabetes. We aimed to investigate gut hormones, lipids, and insulin regulation in response to a meal test in HNF1α defect carriers (MODY3) compared to non-diabetic subjects (controls) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).MethodsWe administered a standardized liquid meal to each participant. Over 6 hours, we measured post-meal responses of insulin regulation (blood glucose, c-peptide, insulin), gut hormones (ghrelin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide-1) and lipids (non-esterified fatty acids [NEFA] and triglycerides).ResultsWe found that MODY3 participants had lower insulin secretion indices than controls and T2D participants, showing the expected β-cell defect. MODY3 had similar glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c median [IQR]: 6.5 [5.6–7.6]%) compared to T2D (median: 6.6 [6.2–6.9]%; P<0.05). MODY3 had greater insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index: 71.9 [29.6; 125.5]) than T2D (3.2 [4.0; 6.0]; P<0.05). MODY3 experienced a larger decrease in the ratio of NEFA to insulin (NEFA 30–0 / insulin 30–0: -39 [-78; -30] x104) in the early post-prandial period (0–30 minutes) compared to controls and to T2D (-2.0 [-0.6; -6.4] x104; P<0.05). MODY3 had lower fasting (0.66 [0.46; 1.2] mM) and post-meal triglycerides levels compared to T2D (fasting: 2.3 [1.7; 2.7] mM; P<0.05). We did not detect significant post-meal differences in ghrelin and incretins between MODY3 and other groups.ConclusionIn response to a standard meal test, MODY3 showed greater early post-prandial NEFA diminution in response to relatively low early insulin secretion, and they maintained very low post-prandial triglycerides levels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426708/

Yet, many patients still fail to be systematically investigated.MethodsTo improve access to services, an ambulatory team has been established since 1998, delivering on-site clinical genetics consultations and gradually upgrading services to 502 children and young adults with ASD in their standard environment across 26 day-care hospitals and specialized institutions within the Greater Paris region. The evaluation included a clinical genetics consultation, screening for fragile X syndrome, metabolic workup, chromosomal microarray analysis, and, in a proportion of patients, next-generation sequencing of genes reported in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.ResultsFragile X syndrome and pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) accounted for the disease in 10% of cases, including 4/312 (1.3%) with fragile X syndrome and 34/388 (8.8%) with pathogenic CNVs (19 de novo and 4 inherited). Importantly, adding high-throughput resequencing of reported intellectual disability/ASD genes to the screening procedure had a major impact on diagnostic yield in the 141 patients examined most recently. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic sequence variants in 27 disease genes were identified in 33/141 patients (23.4%; 23 were de novo and 10 inherited, including five X-linked and five recessive compound heterozygous variants). Diagnosed cases presented atypical and/or syndromic ASD with moderate to severe intellectual disability. The diagnostic yield of fragile X syndrome and array CGH testing combined with next-generation sequencing was significantly higher than fragile X syndrome and array CGH alone (p value 0.009). No inborn errors of metabolism were detected with the metabolic screening.ConclusionBased on the diagnostic rate observed in this cohort, we suggest that a stepwise procedure be considered, first screening pathogenic CNVs and a limited number of disease genes in a much larger number of patients, especially those with syndromic ASD and intellectual disability.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13229-019-0284-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Autism spectrum disorder, Gene panel, Next-generation sequencing, Microarray, Copy number variant, Sequence variant, Fragile X syndrome, Genetic counseling, Genetic diagnosis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6686526/

Predictive values for ZIKV-infected pregnancies were extrapolated from those obtained for pregnancies unrelated to ZIKV. Of 111 eligible full texts, nine studies met our inclusion criteria. Pooled estimates from two studies showed that at 3, 4 and 5 standard deviations (SDs) <mean, sensitivities were 84%, 68% and 58% for head circumference (HC); 76%, 58% and 58% for occipitofrontal diameter (OFD); and 94%, 85% and 59% for biparietal diameter (BPD). Specificities at 3, 4 and 5 SDs below the mean were 70%, 91% and 97% for HC; 84%, 97% and 97% for OFD; and 16%, 46% and 80% for BPD. No study including ZIKV-infected pregnant women was identified. OFD and HC were more consistent in specificity and sensitivity at lower thresholds compared to higher thresholds.

Indeed, although the screening techniques of fetal cardiac anomalies have greatly improved, the detection rate of conotruncal anomalies still remains low due to the fact that they are associated with a normal four-chamber view. Therefore, the study aimed to compare real-time three-dimensional echocardiography with live xPlane imaging with two-dimensional (2D) traditional imaging in visualizing ductal and aortic arches during routine echocardiography of the second trimester of gestation.MethodsThis was an observational prospective study including 114 women with uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies. All sonographic studies were performed by two different operators, of them 60 by a first level operator, while 54 by a second level operator. A subanalysis was run in order to evaluate the feasibility and the time needed for the two procedures according to fetal spine position and operator’s experience.ResultsThe measurements with 2D ultrasound were performed in all 114 echocardiographies, while live xPlane imaging was feasible in the 78% of the cases, and this was mainly due to fetal position. The time lapse needed to visualize aortic and ductal arches was significantly lower when using 2D ultrasound compared to live xPlane imaging (29.56 ± 28.5 s vs. 42.5 ± 38.1 s, P = 0.006 for aortic arch; 22.14 ± 17.8 s vs. 37.1 ± 33.8 s, P = 0.001 for ductal arch), also when performing a subanalysis according to operators’ experience (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Feasibility of live xPlane proved to be correlated with the position of the fetal spine and the operator’s experience.DiscussionTo find a reproducible and standardized method to detect fetal heart defects may bring a great benefit for both patients and operators. In this scenario live xPlane imaging is a novel method to visualize ductal and aortic arches. We found that the position of the fetal spine may affect the feasibility of the method since, when the fetal back is anterior or transverse, the visualization of the correct view of three-vessels and trachea in order to set the reference line properly becomes more challenging. In addition, the fetal spine position influences the duration of the ultrasound examination. Regarding operator’s skills and experience, in our study a first level operator was able to perform the complete 2D and xPlane examination in a lower number of cases compared to second level operators. In addition, the time required for the complete examination was higher for first level operators. This means that this technique is based on an adequate operators’ expertise.Keywords: Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography, Congenital heart disease, Matrix probe, Second trimester screening, Prenatal diagnosis, Conotruncal anomalies",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5890721/

The limited accessibility of bile duct precludes modeling of several cholangiocyte-mediated diseases. Therefore, novel approaches for obtaining functional cholangiocytes with high purity are needed. Previous work has shown that the combination of Hnf1β and Foxa3 could directly convert mouse fibroblasts into bipotential hepatic stem cell-like cells, termed iHepSCs. However, the efficiency of converting fibroblasts into iHepSCs is low, and these iHepSCs exhibit extremely low differentiation potential into cholangiocytes, thus hindering the translation of iHepSCs to the clinic. Here, we describe that the expression of Hnf1α and Foxa3 dramatically facilitates the robust generation of iHepSCs. Notably, prolonged in vitro culture of Hnf1α- and Foxa3-derived iHepSCs induces a Notch signaling-mediated secondary conversion into cholangiocyte progenitor-like cells that display dramatically enhanced differentiation capacity into mature cholangiocytes.

Extensive research over recent decades has expanded our insights into the pathogenesis of the disease, where PD is indicated to result from multifactorial etiological factors involving environmental contributions in genetically predisposed individuals. There has been considerable interest in the association between neurological manifestations in PD and in inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs), which are genetic disorders characterized by a deficient activity in the pathways of intermediary metabolism leading to multiple-system manifestations. In addition to the parallel in various clinical features, there is increasing evidence for the notion that genetic mutations underlying IMDs may increase the risk of PD development. This review highlights the recent advances in parkinsonism in patients with IMDs, with the primary objective to improve the understanding of the overlapping pathogenic pathways and clinical presentations in both disorders.

Sites where mutations occur with higher frequency than would be expected by chance are termed hotspots while sites that contain mutations rarely are termed coldspots. Mutations are permanently scanned and repaired by repair systems. Among them, the mismatch repair targets base pair mismatches, which are discriminated from canonical base pairs by probing altered elasticity of DNA. Using biased molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the elasticity of coldspots and hotspots motifs detected in human genes associated with inherited disorders, and also of motifs with Czech population hotspots and de novo mutations. Main attention was paid to mutations leading to G/T and A+/C pairs. We observed that hotspots without CpG/CpHpG sequences are less flexible than coldspots, which indicates that flexible sequences are more effectively repaired. In contrary, hotspots with CpG/CpHpG sequences exhibited increased flexibility as coldspots. Their mutability is more likely related to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines leading to C > T mutations, which are primarily targeted by base excision repair. We corroborated conclusions based on computer simulations by measuring melting curves of hotspots and coldspots containing G/T mismatch.Keywords: DNA bending, Muts protein, mutations, hotspots–coldspots, free energy calculations",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6704406/

Nutritional genomics aims to prevent, treat, and manage polygenic diseases through targeted therapies formulated from individuals’ genetic makeup and dietary intake. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) has become commercially available to equip individuals with information on their genetic vulnerability to different diseases. This information may potentially prompt behavioral changes against adverse factors. However, scientific evidence behind the clinical recommendations is a matter of continuous debate, and behavioral modifications after disclosing genetic information remain inconclusive. In this review, we provide an overview of nutritional genomics and related nutritional DTC-GT services and discuss whether available data are sufficient to be translated into clinical recommendations and public health initiatives.

The most commonly used biomarker CA19-9 has inadequate sensitivity and specificity for early detection, which we define as Stage I/II cancers. Therefore, progress in next-generation biomarkers is greatly needed. Recent reports have validated a number of biomarkers, including combination assays of proteins and DNA mutations; however, the history of translating promising biomarkers to clinical utility suggests that several major hurdles require careful consideration by the medical community. The first set of challenges involves nominating and verifying biomarkers. Candidate biomarkers need to discriminate disease from benign controls with high sensitivity and specificity for an intended use, which we describe as a two-tiered strategy of identifying and screening high-risk patients. Community-wide efforts to share samples, data, and analysis methods have been beneficial and progress meeting this challenge has been achieved. The second set of challenges is assay optimization and validating biomarkers. After initial candidate validation, assays need to be refined into accurate, cost-effective, highly reproducible, and multiplexed targeted panels and then validated in large cohorts. To move the most promising candidates forward, ideally, biomarker panels, head-to-head comparisons, meta-analysis, and assessment in independent data sets might mitigate risk of failure. Much more investment is needed to overcome these challenges. The third challenge is achieving clinical translation. To moonshot an early detection test to the clinic requires a large clinical trial and organizational, regulatory, and entrepreneurial know-how. Additional factors, such as imaging technologies, will likely need to improve concomitant with molecular biomarker development.

Peripheral GCH1 expression is lower in first episode psychosis patients versus controls, and we hypothesized that a GCH1 promoter polymorphism associated with psychiatric illness, contributes to regulation of both GCH1 expression and BH4 levels. We tested this hypothesis in 120 subjects (85 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 35 controls): Patients with the rs10137071 A allele had significantly lower plasma biopterin than GG patients and controls. In additional samples we assessed the relationship between genotype and diagnosis (schizophrenia or control) on GCH1 expression in the prefrontal cortex (n=67) and peripheral leukocytes (n=53).

Here we report that consecutive transfections of two sets of synthetic mRNAs encoding transcription factors can induce rapid and efficient differentiation of hPSCs into kidney tissues, termed induced nephron-like organoids (iNephLOs). The first set - FIGLA, PITX2, ASCL1 and TFAP2C, differentiated hPSCs into SIX2+SALL1+ nephron progenitor cells with 92% efficiency within 2 days. Subsequently, the second set - HNF1A, GATA3, GATA1 and EMX2, differentiated these cells into PAX8+LHX1+ pretubular aggregates in another 2 days. Further culture in both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional conditions produced iNephLOs containing cells characterized as podocytes, proximal tubules, and distal tubules in an additional 10 days. Global gene expression profiles showed similarities between iNephLOs and the human adult kidney, suggesting possible uses of iNephLOs as in vitro models for kidneys.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6351687/

Participants reported lifelong compliance with AA-MF. In a crossover design, 8 participants (4 males, 4 females, aged 16–35 y) provided a 24-h urine collection after consuming AA-MF or GMP-MF for 1–3 weeks each.ResultsMale participants had significantly lower mean total body BMD Z-scores (means ± SE, males = − 0.9 ± 0.4; females, 0.2 ± 0.3; p = 0.01) and tended to have lower mean L1–4 spine and total femur BMD Z-scores compared to female participants. Only 50% percent of male participants had total body BMD Z-scores above − 1.0 compared to 100% of females (p = 0.06). Total femur Z-scores were negatively correlated with intake of AA-MF (r = − 0.58; p = 0.048). Males tended to consume more grams of protein equivalents per day from AA-MF (means ± SE, males: 67 ± 6 g, females: 52 ± 4 g; p = 0.057). Males and females demonstrated similar urinary excretion of renal net acid, magnesium and sulfate; males showed a trend for higher urinary calcium excretion compared to females (means ± SE, males: 339 ± 75 mg/d, females: 228 ± 69 mg/d; p = 0.13). Females had a greater percentage of total fat mass compared to males (means ± SE, males: 24.5 ± 4.8%, females: 36.5 ± 2.5%; p = 0.047). Mean appendicular lean mass index was similar between males and females.

Hence, data are difficult to interpret and efficacy does not always correspond to real-world effectiveness. We investigated to what extent an efficacy-effectiveness gap exists for OMPs for metabolic diseases and set out to explore which factors contribute to it.MethodsWe included all OMPs for rare metabolic diseases authorized in the EU up to 1 January 2016. Efficacy data were obtained from European Public Assessment Reports, relative effectiveness data from the Dutch National Healthcare Institute website, and real-world effectiveness data from literature and interviews with experts and patients. Efficacy and effectiveness were scored as ‘no effect’, ‘unclear’ or ‘good’ based upon a prespecified scoring system.ResultsWe identified 31 authorized OMPs, of which 21 had post-marketing studies available, thus making it possible to score real-world effectiveness. Eight of 21 (38%) OMPs had a ‘good’ real-world effectiveness. The use of a clinical or validated surrogate primary endpoint and a representative study population seemed to be related to good effectiveness in the real world, as were type of marketing authorization, study population and disease prevalence.ConclusionsThis study revealed that less than half of the authorized OMPs are effective in the real world. Since the type of primary endpoint used in the pivotal study seems to be associated with good real-world effectiveness, it is important to agree upon study endpoints through early dialogues among relevant stakeholders.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s40265-017-0788-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5577060/

While most repositioning efforts emerge through serendipity, we have devised a computational approach, which exploits interaction patterns shared between compounds. As a test case, we took the anti-viral drug brivudine (BVDU), which also has anti-cancer activity, and defined ten interaction patterns using our tool PLIP. These patterns characterise BVDU’s interaction with its target s. Using PLIP we performed an in silico screen of all structural data currently available and identified the FDA approved malaria drug amodiaquine as a promising repositioning candidate. We validated our prediction by showing that amodiaquine suppresses chemoresistance in a multiple myeloma cancer cell line by inhibiting the chaperone function of the cancer target Hsp27. This work proves that PLIP interaction patterns are viable tools for computational repositioning and can provide search query information from a given drug and its target to identify structurally unrelated candidates, including drugs approved by the FDA, with a known safety and pharmacology profile.

Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SH2B3 and SMARCA4 were genotyped using MassARRAY technology. Allelic and genotypic models and haplotype frequencies were compared between groups.

In addition, this species is one of the few canids considered to be an obligate meat-eater, possessing a robust dentition for taking down large prey, and displays one of the most variable coat colorations amongst mammals. Here, we used comparative genomic analysis to investigate the evolutionary history and genetic basis for adaptations associated with cursoriality, hypercanivory, and coat color variation in African wild dogs. Genome-wide scans revealed unique amino acid deletions that suggest a mode of evolutionary digit loss through expanded apoptosis in the developing first digit. African wild dog-specific signals of positive selection also uncovered a putative mechanism of molar cusp modification through changes in genes associated with the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, required for spatial patterning of teeth, and three genes associated with pigmentation. Divergence time analyses suggest the suite of genomic changes we identified evolved ~1.7 Mya, coinciding with the diversification of large-bodied ungulates.

Today, dietary treatment with restricted phenylalanine intake supplemented with non-phenylalanine amino acids to support growth and maintain a healthy body composition remains the mainstay of therapy. However, a better understanding is needed of the factors that influence N balance in the context of amino acid supplementation. The aim of the present paper is to summarise considerations for improving N balance in patients with PKU, with a focus on gaining greater understanding of amino acid absorption, disposition and utilisation. In addition, the impact of phenylalanine-free amino acids on 24 h blood phenylalanine/tyrosine circadian rhythm is evaluated. We compare the effects of administering intact protein v. free amino acid on protein metabolism and discuss the possibility of improving outcomes by administering amino acid mixtures so that their absorption profile mimics that of intact protein. Protein substitutes with the ability to delay absorption of phenylalanine and tyrosine, mimicking physiological absorption kinetics, are expected to improve the rate of assimilation into protein and minimise fluctuations in quantitative plasma amino acid levels. They may also help maintain normal glycaemia and satiety sensation.

Results from Western blots and enzyme activity assays confirmed the import of TAT-PCC into mitochondria, as well as into patient fibroblasts, where the colocalization of imported TAT-PCC and mitochondria was also confirmed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, a single-dose intraperitoneal injection into PCC-deficient mice decreased the propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine (C3/C2) ratio toward the normal level.

Higher mean entropy values and lower mean tone values when stressed showed a reduction in randomness with increased sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic activity. A ROC analysis was used to estimate the diagnostic performances of tone and entropy and combining both features. Comparing the resting and simulation phase separately, the performance of tone outperformed entropy, but combining the two in a quadratic linear regression model, neonates in resting as compared to stress phases could be distinguished with high accuracy.

This impairment in LAO1 KO mice coincided with significantly reduced hippocampal acetylcholine levels compared to wild-type mice, while treatment with donepezil, a reversible acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, inhibited this reduction. Metabolomic analysis revealed that knocking out LAO1 affected amino acid metabolism (mainly of phenylalanine [Phe]) in the hippocampus. Specifically, Phe levels were elevated in LAO1 KO mice, while phenylpyruvic acid (metabolite of Phe produced largely by LAO) levels were reduced. Moreover, knocking out LAO1 decreased hippocampal mRNA levels of pyruvate kinase, the enzymatic activity of which is known to be inhibited by Phe. Based on our findings, we propose that LAO1 KO mice exhibited impaired fear learning and memory owing to low hippocampal acetylcholine levels.

Ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated gene editing in hepatocytes using homology‐directed repair (HDR) is a potential alternative curative therapy to organ transplantation for metabolic liver disease. However, a major limitation of this approach in quiescent adult primary hepatocytes is that nonhomologous end‐joining is the predominant DNA repair pathway for double‐strand breaks (DSBs). This study explored the hypothesis that ex vivo hepatocyte culture could reprogram hepatocytes to favor HDR after CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated DNA DSBs. Quantitative PCR (qPCR), RNA sequencing, and flow cytometry demonstrated that within 24 hours, primary mouse hepatocytes in ex vivo monolayer culture decreased metabolic functions and increased expression of genes related to mitosis progression and HDR. Despite the down‐regulation of hepatocyte function genes, hepatocytes cultured for up to 72 hours could robustly engraft in vivo. To assess functionality long‐term, primary hepatocytes from a mouse model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 bearing a single‐point mutation were transduced ex vivo with two adeno‐associated viral vectors to deliver the Cas9 nuclease, target guide RNAs, and a 1.2‐kb homology template. Adeno‐associated viral Cas9 induced robust cutting at the target locus, and, after delivery of the repair template, precise correction of the point mutation occurred by HDR. Edited hepatocytes were transplanted into recipient fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase knockout mice, resulting in engraftment, robust proliferation, and prevention of liver failure. Weight gain and biochemical assessment revealed normalization of metabolic function. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the potential therapeutic effect of ex vivo hepatocyte‐directed gene editing after reprogramming to cure metabolic disease in a preclinical model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6442694/

These factors can be taken into account when developing or updating NDBS policies.MethodsA mixed methods design was used combining an online survey (n = 753), focus groups (6 groups, 37 participants), and individual in-depth interviews (n = 7). The discussed topics included: parental information, obtaining informed consent, support for retention, and support for secondary use. The study population consisted of Dutch-speaking new parents: pregnant women (≥20 weeks) and/or their partner, and parents of at least one child (≤5 years).ResultsNew parents expressed needs for easily accessible information, adequate communication on the retention and (potential) use of NDBS, clearly described safeguards for privacy, a more active consent process, regulation for the actors conducting NDBS research, and parental involvement in decisions on secondary use.

We have studied monoamine neurotransmitter status and the effect of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) treatment in Pahenu1/enu2 (ENU1/2) mice, a model of partial PAH deficiency. These mice exhibit elevated blood L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) concentrations similar to that of mild hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), but brain levels of L-Phe are still ~5-fold elevated compared to wild-type. We found that brain L-tyrosine, L-tryptophan, BH4 cofactor and catecholamine concentrations, and brain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity were normal in these mice but that brain serotonin, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5HIAA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) content, and brain TH protein, as well as tryptophan hydroxylase type 2 (TPH2) protein levels and activity were reduced in comparison to wild-type mice. Parenteral L-Phe loading conditions did not lead to significant changes in brain neurometabolite concentrations. Remarkably, enteral BH4 treatment, which normalized brain L-Phe levels in ENU1/2 mice, lead to only partial recovery of brain serotonin and 5HIAA concentrations. Furthermore, indirect evidence indicated that the GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) feedback regulatory protein (GFRP) complex may be a sensor for brain L-Phe elevation to ameliorate the toxic effects of HPA. We conclude that BH4 treatment of HPA toward systemic L-Phe lowering reverses elevated brain L-Phe content but the recovery of TPH2 protein and activity as well as serotonin levels is suboptimal, indicating that patients with mild HPA and mood problems (depression or anxiety) treated with the current diet may benefit from supplementation with BH4 and 5-OH-tryptophan.Keywords: Monoamine neurotransmitter, Tyrosine hydroxylase, Tryptophan hydroxylase 2, GTP cyclohydrolase (GTPCH), GTP cyclohydrolase feedback-regulatory protein (GFRP)",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6041158/

In addition, we propose that this framework be used as the basis for developing transparent and scientifically sound advice to the public based on nutrigenetic tests. We feel that although this area is still in its infancy, minimal guidelines are required. Though these guidelines are based on semi-quantitative data, they should stimulate debate on their utility. This framework will be revised biennially, as knowledge on the subject increases.Keywords: Genotype, Dietary advice, Gene-environment interaction, Nutrigenetics, Personalised nutrition, Framework, Genetic variants, Health",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5732517/

Technological advances have stimulated the development of screening programmes to include more conditions, subsequently changing the information required and potential benefit-risk trade-offs driving participation. Quantifying preferences for screening programmes can provide programme commissioners with data to understand potential demand, the drivers of this demand, information provision required to support the programmes and the extent to which preferences differ in a population. This study aimed to identify published studies eliciting preferences for antenatal and newborn screening programmes and provide an overview of key methods and findings.MethodsA systematic search of electronic databases for key terms identified eligible studies (discrete choice experiments (DCEs) or best-worst scaling (BWS) studies related to antenatal/newborn testing/screening published between 1990 and October 2018). Data were systematically extracted, tabulated and summarised in a narrative review.ResultsA total of 19 studies using a DCE or BWS to elicit preferences for antenatal (n = 15; 79%) and newborn screening (n = 4; 21%) programmes were identified. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe (n = 12; 63%) but there were some examples from North America (n = 2; 11%) and Australia (n = 2; 11%). Attributes most commonly included were accuracy of screening (n = 15; 79%) and when screening occurred (n = 13; 68%). Other commonly occurring attributes included information content (n = 11; 58%) and risk of miscarriage (n = 10; 53%). Pregnant women (n = 11; 58%) and healthcare professionals (n = 11; 58%) were the most common study samples. Ten studies (53%) compared preferences across different respondents. Two studies (11%) made comparisons between countries. The most popular analytical model was a standard conditional logit model (n = 11; 58%) and one study investigated preference heterogeneity with latent class analysis.ConclusionThere is an existing literature identifying stated preferences for antenatal and newborn screening but the incorporation of more sophisticated design and analytical methods to investigate preference heterogeneity could extend the relevance of the findings to inform commissioning of new screening programmes.Keywords: Newborn, Antenatal, Screening, Systematic review, Discrete choice experiment, Best-worst scaling, Preferences",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469127/

Synthetic biology approaches offer the ability to genetically engineer these communities to improve the properties of these fermented foods. Soy sauce is a fermented condiment with a vast global market. Engineering members of the microbial communities responsible for soy sauce fermentation may therefore lead to the development of improved products. One important property is the colour of soy sauce, with recent evidence pointing to a consumer preference for more lightly-coloured soy sauce products for particular dishes.ResultsHere we show that a bacterial member of the natural soy sauce fermentation microbial community, Bacillus, can be engineered to reduce the ‘browning’ reaction during soy sauce production. We show that two approaches result in ‘de-browning’: engineered consumption of xylose, an important precursor in the browning reaction, and engineered degradation of melanoidins, the major brown pigments in soy sauce. Lastly, we show that these two strategies work synergistically using co-cultures to result in enhanced de-browning.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate the potential of using synthetic biology and metabolic engineering methods for fine-tuning the process of soy sauce fermentation and indeed for many other natural food and beverage fermentations for improved products.Open in a separate windowElectronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12934-019-1149-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Synthetic microbial communities, Synthetic biology, Metabolic engineering, Soy sauce, Industrial microbiome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6547557/
776,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006734,30640898,"Go to:AbstractMetabolomics is a powerful approach for discovering biomarkers and for characterizing the biochemical consequences of genetic variation. While untargeted metabolite profiling can measure thousands of signals in a single experiment, many biologically meaningful signals cannot be readily identified as known metabolites nor compared across datasets, making it difficult to infer biology and to conduct well-powered meta-analyses across studies. To overcome these challenges, we developed a suite of computational methods, PAIRUP-MS, to match metabolite signals across mass spectrometry-based profiling datasets and to generate metabolic pathway annotations for these signals. To pair up signals measured in different datasets, where retention times (RT) are often not comparable or even available, we implemented an imputation-based approach that only requires mass-to-charge ratios (m/z). As validation, we treated each shared known metabolite as an unmatched signal and showed that PAIRUP-MS correctly matched 70–88% of these metabolites from among thousands of signals, equaling or outperforming a standard m/z- and RT-based approach. We performed further validation using genetic data: the most stringent set of matched signals and shared knowns showed comparable consistency of genetic associations across datasets. Next, we developed a pathway reconstitution method to annotate unknown signals using curated metabolic pathways containing known metabolites. We performed genetic validation for the generated annotations, showing that annotated signals associated with gene variants were more likely to be enriched for pathways functionally related to the genes compared to random expectation. Finally, we applied PAIRUP-MS to study associations between metabolites and genetic variants or body mass index (BMI) across multiple datasets, identifying up to ~6 times more significant signals and many more BMI-associated pathways compared to the standard practice of only analyzing known metabolites. These results demonstrate that PAIRUP-MS enables analysis of unknown signals in a robust, biologically meaningful manner and provides a path to more comprehensive, well-powered studies of untargeted metabolomics data.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347288/

Recent data indicate that IU is likely elevated in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is positively correlated with anxiety. This study examined whether IU may be associated with ASD independent of anxiety. Relationships between anxiety, ASD, and IU were examined in 57 children with ASD without co-occurring intellectual disability and 32 control participants, ages 7 to 16 years. Hierarchal linear regressions were run to examine whether ASD variables, including emotion dysregulation, were predictive of IU when controlling for anxiety. Severity of social communication deficits, repetitive behaviors, and emotion dysregulation were each related to IU when controlling for the effects of anxiety. When these ASD variables were entered together, emotion dysregulation was the only significant predictor of IU. These findings suggest that IU is directly related to features of ASD possibly due to shared genetic, neurological, or psychological underpinnings.Lay SummaryYouth with ASD without co-occurring intellectual disability experience high levels of intolerance of uncertainty (IU), which is related to anxiety.

This study aimed to characterize the long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of pegvaliase in adults with PKU.MethodsPAL-003 is an ongoing, open-label, long-term extension study of the pegvaliase dose-finding parent phase 2 studies. Participants continued the dose of pegvaliase from one of three parent studies, with dose adjustments to achieve a plasma Phe concentration between 60 and 600 μmol/L.ResultsMean (standard deviation [SD]) plasma Phe at treatment-naïve baseline for 80 participants in the parent studies was 1302.4 (351.5) μmol/L. In the 68 participants who entered the extension study, plasma Phe decreased 58.9 (39)% from baseline, to 541.6 (515.5) μmol/L at Week 48 of treatment. Plasma Phe concentrations ≤120 μmol/L, ≤360 μmol/L, and ≤ 600 μmol/L were achieved by 78.7, 80.0, and 82.5% of participants, respectively. Mean (SD) protein intake at baseline was 69.4 (40.4) g/day (similar to the recommended intake for the unaffected population) and remained stable throughout the study. All participants experienced adverse events (AEs), which were limited to mild or moderate severity in most (88.8%); the most common AEs were injection-site reaction (72.5%), injection-site erythema (67.5%), headache (67.5%), and arthralgia (65.0%).

Implementation of a patient-centred approach to both clinical research and care settings, has increased the recognition of patient and/or observer reported outcome measures (PROMs or ObsROMs) as informative and reliable tools for HrQoL assessment. Inherited Metabolic Diseases (IMDs) are a group of heterogeneous conditions with phenotypes ranging from mild to severe and mostly lacking effective therapies. Consequently, HrQoL evaluation is particularly relevant.ObjectivesWe aimed to: (1) identify patient and/or caregiver-reported HrQoL instruments used among IMDs; (2) identify the main results of the application of each HrQoL tool and (3) evaluate the main limitations of HrQoL instruments and study design/methodology in IMDs.MethodsA scoping review was conducted using methods outlined by Arksey and O’Malley. Additionally, we critically analysed each article to identify the HrQoL study drawbacks.ResultsOf the 1954 studies identified, 131 addressed HrQoL of IMDs patients using PROMs and/or ObsROMs, both in observational or interventional studies. In total, we identified 32 HrQoL instruments destined to self- or proxy-completion; only 2% were disease-specific. Multiple tools (both generic and disease-specific) proved to be responsive to changes in HrQoL; the SF-36 and PedsQL questionnaires were the most frequently used in the adult and pediatric populations, respectively. Furthermore, proxy data often demonstrated to be a reliable approach complementing self-reported HrQoL scores. Nevertheless, numerous limitations were identified especially due to the rarity of these conditions.ConclusionsHrQoL is still not frequently assessed in IMDs. However, our results show successful examples of the use of patient-reported HrQoL instruments in this field.

Of these, the category “ultra-processed foods” has been widely studied in relation both to diet quality and to risk factors for noncommunicable disease. The present paper explores the definition of ultra-processed foods since its inception and clearly shows that the definition of such foods has varied considerably. Because of the difficulty of interpretation of the primary definition, the NOVA group and others have set out lists of examples of foods that fall under the category of ultra-processed foods. The present manuscript demonstrates that since the inception of the NOVA classification of foods, these examples of foods to which this category applies have varied considerably. Thus, there is little consistency either in the definition of ultra-processed foods or in examples of foods within this category. The public health nutrition advice of NOVA is that ultra-processed foods should be avoided to achieve improvements in nutrient intakes with an emphasis on fat, sugar, and salt. The present manuscript demonstrates that the published data for the United States, United Kingdom, France, Brazil, and Canada all show that across quintiles of intake of ultra-processed foods, nutritionally meaningful changes are seen for sugars and fiber but not for total fat, saturated fat, and sodium. Moreover, 2 national surveys in the United Kingdom and France fail to show any link between body mass index and consumption of ultra-processed foods.

However, the contribution of aging processes to AD etiology remains unclear. Emerging evidence shows that reduced brain metabolic and vascular functions occur decades before the onset of cognitive impairments, and these reductions are highly associated with low-grade, chronic inflammation developed in the brain over time. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that the gut microbiota may also play a critical role in modulating immune responses in the brain via the brain-gut axis. In this study, our goal was to identify associations between deleterious changes in brain metabolism, cerebral blood flow (CBF), gut microbiome and cognition in aging, and potential implications for AD development. We conducted our study with a group of young mice (5–6 months of age) and compared those to old mice (18–20 months of age) by utilizing metabolic profiling, neuroimaging, gut microbiome analysis, behavioral assessments and biochemical assays. We found that compared to young mice, old mice had significantly increased levels of numerous amino acids and fatty acids that are highly associated with inflammation and AD biomarkers. In the gut microbiome analyses, we found that old mice had increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and alpha diversity. We also found impaired blood-brain barrier (BBB) function and reduced CBF as well as compromised learning and memory and increased anxiety, clinical symptoms often seen in AD patients, in old mice. Our study suggests that the aging process involves deleterious changes in brain metabolic, vascular and cognitive functions, and gut microbiome structure and diversity, all which may lead to inflammation and thus increase the risk for AD. Future studies conducting comprehensive and integrative characterization of brain aging, including crosstalk with peripheral systems and factors, will be necessary to define the mechanisms underlying the shift from normal aging to pathological processes in the etiology of AD.Keywords: aging, MRI, brain metabolism, neurovascular function, gut microbiome, cognition, anxiety, Alzheimer’s disease",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5622159/

These developments have raised a lot of ethical debate. We reviewed the ethical literature on NBS, analyzed the issues and values that emerged, and paid particular interest to the type of impacts authors think NBS should have on the lives of children and their families. Our review shows that most authors keep their ethical reflection confined to policy decisions, about for instance (a) the purpose of the program, and (b) its voluntary or mandatory nature. While some authors show appreciation of how NBS information empowers parents to care for their (diseased) children, most authors consider these aspects to be ‘private’ and leave their evaluation up to parents themselves. While this division of moral labor fits with the liberal conviction to leave individuals free to decide how they want to live their private lives, it also silences the ethical debate about these issues.

Metabolomic analysis was conducted by Metabolon, Inc. on plasma (n=18) and urine (n=9) samples. Catecholamines and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were measured in 24-hr urine samples.ResultsIntake of Tyr and Trp was ~50% higher with AA-MF, and AA-MF were consumed in larger quantities, less frequently during the day compared with GMP-MF. Performance on neuropsychological tests and concentrations of neurotransmitters derived from Tyr and Trp were not significantly different with AA- MF or GMP-MF. Plasma serotonin levels of gut origin were higher in subjects with variant compared with classical PKU, and with GMP-MF compared with AA-MF in subjects with variant PKU. Metabolomics analysis identified higher levels of microbiome-derived compounds synthesized from Tyr, such as phenol sulfate, and higher levels of compounds synthesized from Trp in the kynurenine pathway, such as quinolinic acid, with ingestion of AA-MF compared with GMP-MF.ConclusionsThe Tyr from AA-MF is less bioavailable due, in part, to greater degradation by intestinal microbes compared with the Tyr from prebiotic GMP-MF.

We have studied the activity of NKA and the expression of NKA, SPTA and drebrin in the erythrocyte membrane by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot obtained from the blood samples of patients with NDs culminating in movement and memory dysfunction. We observed a significant reduction in the expressions of NKA, SPTA and drebrin when compared to control and significant variations among the recruited ND samples. On correlating, we found a significant relationship between the expressions and the clinical features such as bradykinesia. Thus, we suggest that the reduction in the expressions of NKA, SPTA and drebrin could function as tools of assessment and speculate the particular neurodegenerative condition.Keywords: Na+, K+-ATPase, spectrin, drebrin, neurodegeneration and movement disorder",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6053092/

Over the years, lowering of TSH cutoffs has contributed to an increased prevalence of detected CH. However, a consensus on the benefit deriving from lowering TSH cutoffs at screening is lacking. The present paper outlines arguments both for and against the lowering of TSH cutoffs at NBS. It includes a review of recently published evidence from Australia, Belgium and Italy. A section focused on economic implications of lowering TSH cutoffs is also provided. One issue that bears further examination is the extent to which mild iodine deficiency at the population level might affect the association of neonatal TSH values with cognitive and developmental outcomes. A debate on TSH cutoffs provides the opportunity to reflect on how to make NBS for CH more effective and to guarantee optimum neurocognitive development and a good quality of life to babies with mild as well as with severe CH. All authors of this debate article agree on the need to establish optimal TSH cutoffs for screening programs in various settings and to ensure the benefits of screening and access to care for newborns worldwide.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5763485/

The heterogeneity of liver cancer represents a clinical challenge. In liver, the transcription factor PPARγ promotes metabolic adaptations of lipogenesis and aerobic glycolysis under the control of Akt2 activity, but the role of PPARγ in liver tumorigenesis is unknown. Here we have combined preclinical mouse models of liver cancer and genetic studies of a human liver biopsy atlas with the aim of identifying putative therapeutic targets in the context of liver steatosis and cancer. We have revealed a protumoral interaction of Akt2 signaling with hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) and PPARγ, transcription factors that are master regulators of hepatocyte and adipocyte differentiation, respectively. Akt2 phosphorylates and inhibits HNF1α, thus relieving the suppression of hepatic PPARγ expression and promoting tumorigenesis. Finally, we observed that pharmacological inhibition of PPARγ is therapeutically effective in a preclinical murine model of steatosis-associated liver cancer. Taken together, our studies in humans and mice reveal that Akt2 controls hepatic tumorigenesis through crosstalk between HNF1α and PPARγ.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5409083/

supplementation in mothers or infants (age ≤2 y) and evaluated standardized measures of
cognitive or visual development up to age 18 y. Of 6286 abstracts and 669 full-text
articles, 38 trials with 53 intervention arms were included. Data were extracted
independently in duplicate. Findings were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis
across supplementation periods (maternal, preterm, term infant); we also explored
subgroup analyses stratified by supplementation period. Heterogeneity was explored using
I2, stratified analysis, and meta-regression. Cognitive
development was assessed by Bayley Scales of Infant Development mental and psychomotor
developmental indexes (MDI, PDI) and intelligence quotient (IQ); visual acuity was
assessed by electrophysiological or behavioral measures.ResultsThe 38 trials (mothers: n = 13; preterm infants:
n = 7; term infants: n = 18) included 5541
participants. When we explored effects during different periods of supplementation, n–3
PUFA supplementation improved MDI in preterm infants (3.33; 95% CI: 0.72, 5.93), without
statistically significant effects on PDI or IQ in different intervention period
subgroups. Visual acuity [measured as the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution
(logMAR)] was improved by supplementation in preterm (–0.08 logMAR; 95% CI: –0.14, –0.01

Although early introduction of a Phe-restricted diet can prevent severe symptoms from developing, patients who are diagnosed and treated early still experience deficits in cognitive functioning indicating shortcomings of current treatment. In the search for new and/or additional treatment strategies, a specific nutrient combination (SNC) was postulated to improve brain function in PKU. In this study, a long-term dietary intervention with a low-Phe diet, a specific combination of nutrients designed to improve brain function, or both concepts together was investigated in male and female BTBR PKU and WT mice.Material & methods48 homozygous wild-types (WT, +/+) and 96 PKU BTBRPah2 (-/-) male and female mice received dietary interventions from postnatal day 31 till 10 months of age and were distributed in the following six groups: high Phe diet (WT C-HP, PKU C-HP), high Phe plus specific nutrient combination (WT SNC-HP, PKU SNC-HP), PKU low-Phe diet (PKU C-LP), and PKU low-Phe diet plus specific nutrient combination (PKU SNC- LP). Memory and motor function were tested at time points 3, 6, and 9 months after treatment initiation in the open field (OF), novel object recognition test (NOR), spatial object recognition test (SOR), and the balance beam (BB). At the end of the experiments, brain neurotransmitter concentrations were determined.ResultsIn the NOR, we found that PKU mice, despite being subjected to high Phe conditions, could master the task on all three time points when supplemented with SNC. Under low Phe conditions, PKU mice on control diet could master the NOR at all three time points, while PKU mice on the SNC supplemented diet could master the task at time points 6 and 9 months. SNC supplementation did not consistently influence the performance in the OF, SOR or BB in PKU mice. The low Phe diet was able to normalize concentrations of norepinephrine and serotonin; however, these neurotransmitters were not influenced by SNC supplementation.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that both a long-lasting low Phe diet, the diet enriched with SNC, as well as the combined diet was able to ameliorate some, but not all of these PKU-induced abnormalities. Specifically, this study is the first long-term intervention study in BTBR PKU mice that shows that SNC supplementation can specifically improve novel object recognition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6420157/

Association tests and statistical power were applied.Results: Among the 75 mothers, 47 (62.7%) would have liked to receive more information about the newborn screening, especially regarding the correct sample collection period, followed by the screened morbidities. Most participants (n=55; 85.9%) took their children to be tested between the third and the seventh day of birth, as recommended by the Brazilian Health Ministry. Fifty-four women (72%) were unable to name the morbidities screened by the test in Minas Gerais, and they were also unaware that most have genetic etiology. The health professional who informed the mother about the Guthrie test was mainly the physician. This information was given prenatally to 57% of the cases, and to 43 % at the time of discharge from the hospital. The association test showed that mothers with higher education have more knowledge about the purpose and importance of the Guthrie test.

One intervention that can be used prior to a needle insertion procedure is application of a topical local anaesthetic.ObjectivesTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical anaesthetics such as amethocaine and EMLA in newborn term or preterm infants requiring an invasive procedure involving puncture of skin and other tissues with a needle.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase and CINAHL up to 15 May 2016; previous reviews including cross‐references, abstracts, and conference proceedings. We contacted expert informants. We contacted authors directly to obtain additional data. We imposed no language restrictions.Selection criteriaRandomised, quasi‐randomised controlled trials, and cluster and cross‐over randomised trials that compared the topical anaesthetics amethocaine and eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics (EMLA) in terms of anaesthetic efficacy and safety in newborn term or preterm infants requiring an invasive procedure involving puncture of skin and other tissues with a needleData collection and analysisFrom the reports of the clinical trials we extracted data regarding clinical outcomes including pain, number of infants with methaemoglobin level 5% and above, number of needle prick attempts prior to successful needle‐related procedure, crying, time taken to complete the procedure, episodes of apnoea, episodes of bradycardia, episodes of oxygen desaturation, neurodevelopmental disability and other adverse events.Main resultsEight small randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria (n = 506). These studies compared either EMLA and placebo or amethocaine and placebo. No studies compared EMLA and amethocaine. We were unable to meta‐analyse the outcome of pain due to differing outcome measures and methods of reporting. For EMLA, two individual studies reported a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to placebo during lumbar puncture and venepuncture. Three studies found no statistical difference between the groups during heel lancing. For amethocaine, three studies reported a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to placebo during venepuncture and one study reported a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to placebo during cannulation. One study reported no statistical difference between the two groups during intramuscular injection.One study reported no statistical difference between EMLA and the placebo group for successful venepuncture at first attempt. One study similarly reported no statistically significant difference between Amethocaine and the placebo group for successful cannulation at first attempt.Risk for local redness, swelling or blanching was significantly higher with EMLA (typical risk ratio (RR) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 2.19; typical risk difference (RD) 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.26; n = 272; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 6, 95% CI 4 to 11; I2 = 92% indicating considerable heterogeneity) although not for amethocaine (typical RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.72 to 6.16; typical RD 0.05, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.11, n = 221). These local skin reactions for EMLA and amethocaine were reported as short‐lasting. Two studies reported no methaemoglobinaemia with single application of EMLA. The quality of the evidence on outcomes assessed according to GRADE was low to moderate.Authors' conclusionsOverall, all the trials were small, and the effects of uncertain clinical significance. The evidence regarding the effectiveness or safety of the interventions studied is inadequate to support clinical recommendations. There has been no evaluation regarding any long‐term effects of topical anaesthetics in newborn infants.High quality studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of topical anaesthetics such as amethocaine and EMLA for needle‐related pain in newborn term or preterm infants are required. These studies should aim to determine efficacy of these topical anaesthetics and on homogenous groups of infants for gestational age. While there was no methaemoglobinaemia in the studies that reported methaemoglobin, the efficacy and safety of EMLA, especially in very preterm infants, and for repeated application, need to be further evaluated in future studies.Keywords: Humans, Infant, Newborn, Anesthesia, Local, Anesthesia, Local/adverse effects, Anesthesia, Local/methods, Anesthetics, Local, Anesthetics, Local/administration & dosage, Anesthetics, Local/adverse effects, Catheterization, Catheterization/adverse effects, Drug Combinations, Infant, Premature, Needles, Pain, Pain/etiology, Pain/prevention & control, Pain Measurement, Phlebotomy, Phlebotomy/adverse effects, Punctures, Punctures/adverse effects, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Spinal Puncture, Spinal Puncture/adverse effects, Tetracaine, Tetracaine/administration & dosage",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6464546/

The word thought is defined as the act of thinking about or considering something: an idea or opinion, or a set of ideas about a particular subject. It implicitly includes the processes of learning. Mental functions, including most if not all aspects of human behavior, such as those related to learning, arise from the activity of the brain. Neural connections that generate and support mental functions are formed throughout life, which enables lifelong learning of new concepts and skills. Both brain formation and function, as well as neural plasticity, are influenced by the activity of a variety of genes and also by epigenetic modifications, which contribute to the regulation of gene expression by adapting it to environmental conditions. In this review, aimed especially at education professionals, I discuss the genetic and epigenetic contributions to mental aspects related to learning processes in terms of heritability. I will argue that, despite most if not all aspects related to learning having a clear genetic background, innate abilities can be enhanced or diminished through educational processes. Thus, the importance of education, in the context of the inheritability of learning processes, will be discussed. The conclusion I draw is that, despite the relatively high genetic heritability shown in most brain processes associated with learning, educational practices are a key contributor to student development, allowing genetically based skills to be enhanced or alternatively diminished. Therefore one of the main goals of education in a changing an uncertain world should be to form adaptable and versatile people who can, and want to, make the most of their capabilities. Thus, knowledge derived from genetics and epigenetics, as well as from neuroscience, should be used to enhance education professionals’ understanding of the biological origins of differences in mental capabilities, thereby empowering them with the possibility to adopt more respectful and flexible educational practices to attain the goal mentioned above.Keywords: genetics, epigenetics, heritability, environment, learning, adaptation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6635910/

GPI deficiency, transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, is considered the second most common erythro-enzymopathy of anaerobic glycolysis, after pyruvate kinase deficiency. Despite this, this defect may sometimes be misdiagnosed and only about 60 cases of GPI deficiency have been reported. GPI deficient patients are affected by chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia of variable severity; in rare cases, intellectual disability or neuromuscular symptoms have also been reported. The gene locus encoding GPI is located on chromosome 19q13.1 and contains 18 exons. So far, about 40 causative mutations have been identified. We report the clinical, hematological and molecular characteristics of 12 GPI deficient cases (eight males, four females) from 11 families, with a median age at admission of 13 years (ranging from 1 to 51); eight of them were of Italian origin. Patients displayed moderate to severe anemia, that improves with aging. Splenectomy does not always result in the amelioration of anemia but may be considered in transfusion-dependent patients to reduce transfusion intervals. None of the patients described here displayed neurological impairment attributable to the enzyme defect. We identified 13 different mutations in the GPI gene, six of them have never been described before; the new mutations affect highly conserved residues and were not detected in 1000 Genomes and HGMD databases and were considered pathogenic by several mutation algorithms. This is the largest series of GPI deficient patients so far reported in a single study.

A one stage membrane system gave 90% pure GMP and a three-stage rectification system gave 97% pure GMP. The charged membrane was salt-tolerant up to 40 mS cm−1 conductivity, allowing fractionation of GMP directly from cheese whey without first lowering the whey conductivity by water dilution.

Rapid advances in our understanding of the biological mechanisms responsible for many rare disorders have enabled the development of specific treatments for some of them. Well-known historical examples include Wilson disease and dopa-responsive dystonia, for which specific and highly effective treatments have life-altering effects.

The present study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of two chromatographic methodologies for determination of plasma Phe level in the routine management of PKU: the two dimensional thin layer chromatography (2D - TLC) and the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedures, respectively.Material and MethodsSamples of blood from 23 children with HPA detected by neonatal screening or with confirmed PKU who received treatment by low-Phe diet were analyzed to estimate the plasma Phe level by the two chromatographic procedures.ResultsIn case of three subjects the very low concentrations of plasma Phe could not be detected by the 2D - TLC methodology, since the spot was not visible on the chromatogram. In four patients the differences between the values of plasma Phe determined by the two methodologies are not statistically significant, while in fifteen subjects the differences are highly statistically significant. This is due to the greater errors that appear in the case of 2D - TLC methodology. In the range of concentrations of plasma Phe higher than 360 μmol/L (which is the cut-off value for HPA), although in four cases there were statistically significant differences in the level of plasma Phe determined by the two methodologies, the value obtained by the 2D - TLC methodology was high enough to influence the decision of changing the diet so that HPA is kept under control. In addition, the intense spot of Phe on the 2D - TLC chromatogram may be detected even by un unexperienced laboratory specialist.ConclusionThe HPLC procedure for measurement of plasma Phe level is very suitable to be used in the routine management of PKU.

Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) results revealed no significant differences among these three groups of mothers regarding overall anxiety, stress and depression. However, FP mothers experienced lower levels of stress related to their own health compared to TN group. Two potential trends were also identified; results suggested TN mothers might experience higher levels of isolation than mothers in the TP group and that FP mothers might report higher stress levels in relation to spousal relationships compared to the TN group. FP mothers seemed to report similar or better levels of psychosocial functioning than TN mothers. Our findings are encouraging with respect to impacts of NBS on maternal well-being. We also identify key areas for improvement (parental education) and research (isolation and spousal relationships).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5891497/

Modern parents are often the only child in their family because of China’s One-Child Policy and thus may lack interaction with siblings. Accordingly, the present study aimed to explore whether different caregivers affect the physical and development of infants in China.MethodsIn total, 2,514 infants were enrolled in our study. We assessed their weight-for-age, supine length-for-age, weight-for-length, occipital-frontal circumference, and Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) results and recorded their general parental information and their primary caregivers.ResultsThe weights and lengths of 12-month-old infants under the care of babysitters were significantly lower than those of infants under the care of parents or grandparents (P < 0.05). Additionally, 12-month-old infants under the care of babysitters had the lowest DDST pass rate (75%) among the three groups (χ2 = 11.819, P = 0.012), especially for the fine motor-adaptive and language domains. Compared to 12-month-old infants under the care of parents and babysitters, infants under the care of grandparents were more likely to be overweight or obese (P < 0.001).ConclusionThe study showed that caregivers had a dominant role in the physical and cognitive development of the infants. Specifically, compared with infants raised by grandparents and parents, 12-month-old infants under the care of babysitters had partially suppressed lengths and weights and lagged cognitively. The 12-month-old infants under the care of grandparents were more overweight than those cared for by parents and babysitters.Keywords: caregivers, growth and development, infants, obesity, Denver Developmental Screening Test",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696336/

In the present study, 46 primary caregivers of children with PKU completed measures of psychological distress, parenting stress (related to caring for a child with an illness), resilience, perceived social support and child dependency. Treatment adherence was assessed using the proportion of blood phenylalanine concentrations within target range in the preceding year. Results indicated that 59% of caregivers showed clinical levels of psychological distress, which was predicted by their parenting stress and resilience. Whilst the proportion of blood phenylalanine concentrations in range was not associated with parental distress, it was predicted by child age and caregiver’s perceived support from family. Despite experiencing high levels of distress, the results indicated that caregivers’ ability to adhere to treatment was not affected. Interventions to reduce parenting stress and boost caregiver resilience may have a positive effect on parental wellbeing. Additionally, interventions to promote treatment adherence benefit parents of older children, with a focus on promoting support from family members. Further research with larger sample sizes and longitudinal designs is needed to further establish causal mechanisms.Keywords: Adherence, Children, Distress, Parent, Phenylketonuria, Wellbeing",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5740045/

A latent trait model is developed to combine rare birth defect outcomes in an index of infant morbidity.MethodsThis study employed four statewide, retrospective 10-year data sources (1999 to 2009). The study cohort consisted of all female Florida Medicaid enrollees who delivered a live singleton infant during study period. Drug exposure was defined as any exposure to Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy. Mothers with no AED exposure served as the AED unexposed group for comparison. Four adverse outcomes, birth defect (BD), abnormal condition of new born (ACNB), low birth weight (LBW), and pregnancy and obstetrical complication (PCOC), were examined and combined using a latent trait model to generate an overall severity index. Unidimentionality, local independence, internal homogeneity, and construct validity were evaluated for the combined outcome.ResultsThe study cohort consisted of 3183 mother-infant pairs in total AED group, 226 in the valproate only subgroup, and 43,956 in the AED unexposed group. Compared to AED unexposed group, the rate of BD was higher in both the total AED group (12.8% vs. 10.5%, P < .0001), and the valproate only subgroup (19.6% vs. 10.5%, P < .0001). The combined outcome was significantly correlated with the length of hospital stay during delivery in both the total AED group (Rho = 0.24, P < .0001) and the valproate only subgroup (Rho = 0.16, P = .01). The mean score for the combined outcome in the total AED group was significantly higher (2.04 ± 0.02 vs. 1.88 ± 0.01, P < .0001) than AED unexposed group, whereas the valproate only subgroup was not.ConclusionsLatent trait modeling can be an effective tool for combining adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes to assess prenatal exposure to AED, but evaluation of the selected components is essential to ensure the validity of the combined outcome.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12884-016-1190-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Latent trait model, Antiepileptic drugs, Valproate, Adverse pregnancy outcome, Adverse perinatal outcome, Combining outcomes",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5219655/

be oxidized for energy, used as a precursor for acetylcholine, or incorporated
into glutamate, glutamine and GABA, or into lipids for myelination and cell
growth. Administration of ALCAR after brain injury in rat pups improved
long-term functional outcomes, including memory. Additional studies are needed

Precision, linearity, interferences, and stability and were determined and the method was used to analyze samples from 36 human volunteers. The method was compared with clinically validated measurements in paired blood collected via venipuncture.ResultsThe method was relatively precise for these proteins (10–11% CV) and linear across the normal concentration ranges of these proteins. Interference from high total serum protein concentration (>8 g/dL) was noted for apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B.

The phenylketonuria – quality of life (PKU-QOL) questionnaire was the first self-administered disease-specific instrument developed to assess the impact of PKU and its treatment on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of patients and their caregivers. Available in four versions (child, adolescent, adult and parent), the PKU-QOL was simultaneously developed and validated in seven countries [i.e., France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom (UK)]. The objectives of our study were to develop and linguistically validate the PKU-QOL questionnaire for use in the United States (US).MethodsThe UK versions served as a basis for the development of the US English PKU-QOL questionnaire. The linguistic validation process consisted of 4 steps: 1) adaptation of the UK versions into US English by a translator native of US English and living in the US; 2) a clinician review; 3) cognitive interviews with patients and caregivers to test the appropriateness, understandability and clarity of the US translations; and 4) two proof-readings.ResultsThe adaptation from UK to US English revealed the usual syntactic and idiomatic differences between the two languages, such as differences in: 1) Spelling, e.g., “dietician” (UK) vs. “dietitian” (US), or “mum” (UK) vs. “mom” (US); 2) Syntax or punctuation; and 3) Words/expressions use, e.g., “holidays” (UK) vs. “vacation” (US), or “biscuits” (UK) vs. “crackers” (US). The major issue was cultural, and consisted of using a different terminology to describe PKU treatment throughout the questionnaires. The clinician, with the patients and the caregivers, during the interviews suggested to replace “supplement and amino-acid mixture” or “supplements” with “medical formula.” This wording was later changed to “medical food” to be consistent with the terminology used in current US published guidelines.ConclusionsThe translation of the UK English PKU-QOL questionnaire into US English did not raise critical semantic and cultural issues.

Overall, 50 mothers of children with PKU that were referred to Endocrine Clinic in Qods Hospital of Qazvin City, northwestern Iran in 2016, were selected and randomly divided into intervention and control groups. Data collection was made by using demographic characteristics of mothers and children and also the Zarit burden interview questionnaires. Empowerment program was delivered during nine sessions of holistic and family oriented empowerment model in the intervention group. The control group received routine services.

This leads to a significant reduction in eye size, a severe loss of photoreceptors and loss of vision based on electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. Expression of the par-1 p.Arg792Gly mutation (equivalent to the MARK3 variant found in patients) in developing fly eyes also induces loss of eye tissue and reduces the ERG signals. The data in flies and human indicate that the MARK3 variant corresponds to a loss of function.

Treatments for the high morbidity/mortality associated diseases (ATL and HAM/TSP) are limited, therefore, infection prevention is of utmost importance. However, antenatal screening is not routinely performed in Brazil. A lack of data regarding the number of individuals infected via breastfeeding impairs the development of government policies. The objective is to estimate the number of HTLV-1 infections occurring annually due to mother to child transmission (MTCT) in Brazil, nationally and regionally.MethodologyTo estimate HTLV-1 MTCT in Brazil the following variables are modelled: number of births, prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in pregnant women, breastfeeding duration rate and transmission risk according to breastfeeding period. The number of cases of HAM/TSP and ATL attributable to MTCT are also estimated.Principal findingsIn 2008, there were 2,934,828 live births in Brazil. HTLV prevalence in pregnant women in Brazil ranges between 0.1–1.05% by region. An estimated 16,548 HTLV-1 infected women are pregnant each year.

To date, genomic medicine has achieved its greatest successes through applications to diseases that have a high genotype–phenotype correlation and high penetrance, with a near certainty that the individual will develop the condition in the presence of the genotype. It has been anticipated that genomics will play an important role in promoting population health by targeting at-risk individuals and reducing the incidence of highly prevalent, costly, complex diseases, with potential applications across screening, prevention, and treatment decisions. However, where primary or secondary prevention requires behavioural changes, there is currently very little evidence to support reduction in disease incidence. A better understanding of the relationship between genomic variation and complex diseases will be necessary before effective genomic risk identification and management of the risk of complex diseases in healthy individuals can be carried out in clinical practice. Our recommended approach is that priority for genomic testing should focus on diseases where there is strong genotype–phenotype correlation, high or certain penetrance, the effects of the disease are serious and near-term, there is the potential for prevention and/or treatment, and the net costs incurred are acceptable for the health gains achieved.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5698310/

Epidemiology evidence indicates that a diet rich in antioxidant fruits and vegetables significantly reduces the risk of many oxidative stress related diseases viz. cancers, diabetes and cardiovascular. The number and position of hydroxyl group in a particular phenolic compound leads to the variation in their antioxidant potential. Polyphenols are the main source of dietary antioxidants, and are effortlessly absorbed in the intestine. Phenolic acids, a sub class of plant phenolics, possess phenol moiety and resonance stabilized structure which causes the H-atom donation results in antioxidant property through radical scavenging mechanism. Other mode such as radical quenching via electron donation and singlet oxygen quenching are also known for the antioxidant activity of phenolic acids. Furthermore, phenolic acids are found ubiquitously and well documented for other health protective effects like antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagenic etc. The contribution emphasize on the phenolic acids potential in drug discovery.

Additionally, 15 other different variations in the PAH gene were identified, each with very low incidence, providing ground for phenotypic variability and potential response to BH4 therapy. Genealogical analysis revealed some “hotspots” of the origin of the p.Arg408Trp variation, with especially high density in South-East Estonia. According to our data, the incidence of PKU in Estonia is estimated as 1 in 6,700 newborns.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/8904_2017_61) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Hyperphenylalaninaemia, PAH variation spectrum, Phenylalanine hydroxylase, Phenylketonuria, Variations in Estonian population",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6122019/

The exact mechanisms by which HPDs exert their effects are unclear. However, evidence suggests that the sensing of amino acids produced as a result of protein digestion may have a role in appetite regulation and satiety. We investigated the effects of l-phenylalanine (L-Phe) on food intake and glucose homeostasis in rodents.Methods:We investigated the effects of the aromatic amino-acid and calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) agonist l-phenylalanine (L-Phe) on food intake and the release of the gastrointestinal (GI) hormones peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and ghrelin in rodents, and the role of the CaSR in mediating these effects in vitro and in vivo. We also examined the effect of oral l-Phe administration on glucose tolerance in rats.Results:Oral administration of l-Phe acutely reduced food intake in rats and mice, and chronically reduced food intake and body weight in diet-induced obese mice. Ileal l-Phe also reduced food intake in rats. l-Phe stimulated GLP-1 and PYY release, and reduced plasma ghrelin, and also stimulated insulin release and improved glucose tolerance in rats. Pharmacological blockade of the CaSR attenuated the anorectic effect of intra-ileal l-Phe in rats, and l-Phe-induced GLP-1 release from STC-1 and primary L cells was attenuated by CaSR blockade.Conclusions:l-Phe reduced food intake, stimulated GLP-1 and PYY release, and reduced plasma ghrelin in rodents. Our data provide evidence that the anorectic effects of l-Phe are mediated via the CaSR, and suggest that l-Phe and the CaSR system in the GI tract may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of obesity and diabetes.

The duration of recently completed drug trials that support approval for drug therapy in children with chronic diseases has not been systematically evaluated. Such information is a vital first step in forming safety pharmacovigilance strategies for drugs used for long-term therapy in children.OBJECTIVETo characterize the duration of clinical trials submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pediatric drug approvals, with a focus on drugs used for long-term therapy.DESIGN AND SETTINGA review was performed of all safety and efficacy clinical trials conducted under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act or the Pediatric Review Equity Act and submitted to the FDA from September 1, 2007, to December 31, 2014, to support the approval of drugs frequently used for long-term therapy in children. Statistical analysis was performed from July 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESMaximum duration of trials submitted to support FDA approval of drugs for children.RESULTSA total of 306 trials supporting 86 drugs intended for long-term use in children were eligible for the primary analysis. The drugs most commonly evaluated were for treatment of neurologic (25 [29%]), pulmonary (16 [19%]), and anti-infective (14 [16%]) indications. The median maximum trial duration by drug was 44 weeks (minimum, 1.1 week; maximum, 364 weeks). For nearly two-thirds of the drugs (52 [61%]), the maximum trial duration was less than 52 weeks. For 10 of the drugs (12%), the maximum trial duration was 3 years or more. Maximum duration of trials did not vary by therapeutic category, minimum age of enrollment, calendar year, or legislative mandate.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEPediatric clinical trials designed to sufficiently investigate drug safety and efficacy to support FDA approval are of relatively limited duration. Given the potential long-term exposure of patients to these drugs, the clinical community should consider whether new approaches are needed to better understand the safety associated with long-term use of these drugs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6526087/

Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) programs promote UNHS and using information systems support access to follow-up diagnostic and early intervention services so that infants can be screened no later than 1 month of age, with those who do not pass their screen receiving diagnostic evaluation no later than 3 months of age, and those with diagnosed hearing loss receiving intervention services no later than 6 months of age. In this paper, we first document the rapid roll-out of UNHS/EHDI policies and programs at the national and state/territorial levels in the United States between 1997 and 2005. We then review cost analyses and economic arguments that were made in advancing those policies in the United States. Finally, we examine evidence on language and educational outcomes that pertain to the economic benefits of UNHS/EHDI. In conclusion, although formal cost-effectiveness analyses do not appear to have played a decisive role, informal economic assessments of costs and benefits appear to have contributed to the adoption of UNHS policies in the United States.Keywords: cost-effectiveness, cost analysis, EHDI, neonatal screening, hearing screening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6094389/

Urine-derived epithelial cells (UCs) from a 15-year-old male patient with PKU were isolated and reprogrammed with integration-free episomal vectors carrying an OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and miR-302-367 cluster. PKU-UiPSCs were verified as correct using alkaline phosphatase staining. Pluripotency markers were detected with real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Promoter methylation in two pluripotent genes, NANOG and OCT4, was analyzed using bisulphite sequencing. An embryoid body (EB) formation assay was also performed. An induced pluripotent stem cell line (iPSC) was generated from epithelial cells in urine from a patient with PKU. This cell line had increased expression of stem cell biomarkers, it efficiently formed EBs, it stained positive for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and it had a marked decrease in promoter methylation in the NANOG and OCT4 genes.

Dysfunction in folding caused by genetic mutations in numerous genes causes protein conformational diseases. Membrane proteins are more prone to misfolding due to their more intricate folding than soluble proteins. Misfolded proteins are detected by the cellular quality control systems, especially in the endoplasmic reticulum, and proteins may be retained there for eventual degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or through autophagy. Some misfolded proteins aggregate, leading to pathologies in numerous neurological diseases. In vitro, modulating mutant protein folding by altering molecular chaperone expression can ameliorate some misfolding. Some small molecules known as chemical chaperones also correct mutant protein misfolding in vitro and in vivo. However, due to their lack of specificity, their potential as therapeutics is limited. Another class of compounds, known as pharmacological chaperones (pharmacoperones), binds with high specificity to misfolded proteins, either as enzyme substrates or receptor ligands, leading to decreased folding energy barriers and correction of the misfolding. Because many of the misfolded proteins are misrouted but do not have defects in function per se, pharmacoperones have promising potential in advancing to the clinic as therapeutics, since correcting routing may ameliorate the underlying mechanism of disease. This review will comprehensively summarize this exciting area of research, surveying the literature from in vitro studies in cell lines to transgenic animal models and clinical trials in several protein misfolding diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5966717/

This study was conducted to determine if three prototype 4-mg nicotine lozenges produced locally in India were bioequivalent to a globally marketed reference product, Nicorette® 4-mg nicotine lozenge. Materials and methods: Healthy adult smokers (N = 39) were treated with three prototype 4-mg nicotine lozenges in comparison with a reference 4-mg lozenge in this single-center, randomized, open-label, single-dose, 4-way crossover study. Pharmacokinetic sampling was obtained to test for bioequivalence using maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC0–t). Secondarily, AUC0–∞, time to maximal plasma concentration (tmax), half-life (T1/2), elimination rate constant (Kel), and safety of the prototype lozenges versus the reference lozenge were compared. Results: Each prototype 4-mg nicotine lozenge was found to be bioequivalent to the reference 4-mg nicotine lozenge based on the ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence intervals for Cmax, AUC0–t, and AUC0–∞. Although tmax was significantly longer for prototype III, all four lozenges achieved maximum plasma nicotine concentrations at a median of 1.5 hours. The safety profiles of the three prototype 4-mg lozenges did not differ from that of the 4-mg reference product. Conclusion: Each prototype 4-mg nicotine lozenge was bioequivalent to the reference 4-mg nicotine lozenge and was well tolerated. Furthermore, as these bioequivalent prototypes differed in in-vitro dissolution profiles, these data suggest that performance from the in vitro method deployed is not a firm predictor of pharmacokinetic behavior.

Several elements that affect CCHD screening costs were assessed in varying numbers of studies, including screening staff time, instrumentation, and consumables, as well as costs of diagnosis and treatment. A previous US study that used conservative assumptions suggested that CCHD screening is likely to be considered cost-effective from the healthcare sector perspective. Newly available estimates of avoided infant CCHD deaths in several US states that implemented mandatory CCHD screening policies during 2011–2013 suggest a substantially larger reduction in deaths than was projected in the previous US cost-effectiveness analysis. Taking into account these new estimates, we estimate that cost per life-year gained could be as low as USD 12,000.

Pegcristantaspase, a recombinant PEGylated Erwinia asparaginase with improved pharmacokinetics, was developed for patients with hypersensitivity to pegaspargase. Here, we report a series of patients treated on a pediatric phase 2 trial of pegcrisantaspase.ProcedurePediatric patients with ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma and hypersensitivity to pegaspargase enrolled on Children's Oncology Group trial AALL1421 (Jazz 13-011) and received intravenous pegcrisantaspase. Serum asparaginase activity (SAA) was monitored before and after dosing; immunogenicity assays were performed for antiasparaginase and anti-PEG antibodies and complement activation was evaluated.ResultsThree of the four treated patients experienced hypersensitivity to pegcrisantaspase manifested as clinical hypersensitivity reactions or rapid clearance of SAA. Immunogenicity assays demonstrated the presence of anti-PEG immunoglobulin G antibodies in all three hypersensitive patients, indicating a PEG-mediated immune response.ConclusionsThis small series of patients, nonetheless, provides data, suggesting preexisting immunogenicity against the PEG moiety of pegaspargase and poses the question as to whether PEGylation may be an effective strategy to optimize Erwinia asparaginase administration.

This multilevel meta-analysis focuses on mental speed tasks, for which outcome measures often consist of RTs. The size of RT reduction due to retesting in mental speed tasks for up to four test administrations was analyzed based on 36 studies including 49 samples and 212 outcomes for a total sample size of 21,810. Significant RT reductions were found, which increased with the number of test administrations, without reaching a plateau. Larger RT reductions were observed in more complex mental speed tasks compared to simple ones, whereas age and test-retest interval mostly did not moderate the size of the effect. Although a high heterogeneity of effects exists, retest effects were shown to occur for mental speed tasks regarding RT outcomes and should thus be more thoroughly accounted for in applied and research settings.Keywords: meta-analysis, mental speed, processing speed, retest effect, practice effect, response time, reaction time, automatization",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6480749/

Individual dispersion profiles were obtained using a regression method which computes individual standard deviation across tasks from standardized test scores. Results revealed associations between performance, dispersion and cognitive reserve (measured as education level). Although differences across groups did not approach significance, there was a general pattern consistent with existing literature showing greater dispersion in the old-old group, and this was negatively associated with performance. In contrast, the middle-old group showed young-equivalent dispersion index, while performance was similar to the young group on some tasks and to the old-old group on others, possibly reflecting differences in cognitive demand. Educational level positively correlated with performance in the middle-old group only. Overall, a distinct pattern emerged for the middle-old adults: they showed young-equivalent performance on a number of measures and similar dispersion index, while uniquely benefitting from cognitive reserve. This may possibly reflect engagement in compensatory mechanisms. This study contributes to clarifying inconsistencies in previous studies and calls for more thoughtful selection of sample cohorts in aging research. The study of dispersion may provide a behavioral index of age-related changes in how cognition functions and recruits resources. Future work could examine whether this also reflects age-related changes in neural recruitment and aim at identifying factors contributing to cognitive reserve, in order to prolong good performance and improve cognition in aging.Keywords: intra-individual variability, dispersion, fluid cognition, executive functions, aging, compensation, cognitive reserve, education",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6198726/

Through this study, a novel mutation in the PAH gene in an Iranian pedigree with phenylketonuria was introduced.Methods:A consanguineous family with a 10-year old affected girl was referred for genetic analysis. Mutation screening of all exons and exon-intron boundaries was performed by Sanger sequencing, and mini haplotype analysis was carried out by genotyping of Short Tandem Repeat (STR) and Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) alleles.Results:Mutation analysis revealed a novel homozygous insertion of a single adenine nucleotide at position 335 in exon 3 of the PAH gene. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, the change is interpreted as a pathogenic mutation which produces a premature termination signal (TAA) at codon 113 according to in silico assessments. The mini haplotype analysis showed that this mutation was linked to STR (15) –VNTR (3).Conclusion:In this study, a novel mutation was reported in a patient who had PKU symptoms without any previously reported mutations in the PAH gene ({""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NM_000277.1"",""term_id"":""4557818"",""term_text"":""NM_000277.1""}}NM_000277.1:p.Asp112Glufs*2) that can be responsible for the classical PKU phenotype in the Iranian population.

Individually rare these conditions have currently, a collective estimated prevalence of >1:800. Diagnosis has improved through expanded newborn screening programs, identification of potentially affected family members and greater awareness of symptomatic presentations in adolescence and in adulthood. Better survival and reduced mortality from previously lethal and debilitating conditions means greater numbers transition to adulthood. Pregnancy, once contraindicated for many, may represent a challenging but successful outcome. Successful pregnancies are now reported in a wide range of IEM. Significant challenges remain, given the biological stresses of pregnancy, parturition and the puerperium. Known diagnoses allow preventive and pre-emptive management. Unrecognized metabolic disorders especially, remain a preventable cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. Increased awareness of these conditions amongst all clinicians is essential to expedite diagnosis and manage appropriately. This review aims to describe normal adaptations to pregnancy and discuss how various types of IEM may be affected. Relevant translational research and clinical experience will be reviewed with practical management aspects cited. Based on current literature, the impact of maternal IEM on mother and/or foetus, as well as how foetal IEM may affect the mother, will be considered. Insights gained from these rare disorders to more common conditions will be explored.

Serosurveillance can be a useful tool for estimating the intensity of cholera transmission and prioritizing populations for cholera control interventions. Current methods involving venous blood draws and downstream specimen storage and transport methods pose logistical challenges in most settings where cholera strikes. To overcome these challenges, we developed methods for determining cholera-specific immune responses from dried blood spots (DBS).Methodology/principal findingsAs conventional vibriocidal assay methods were unsuitable for DBS eluates from filter paper, we adopted a drop-plate culture method. We show that DBS collected from volunteers in South Sudan, and stored for prolonged periods in field conditions, retained functional vibriocidal antibodies, the titers of which correlated with paired serum titers determined by conventional spectrophotometric methods (r = 0.94, p = 0.00012). We also showed that eluates from DBS Serum Separator cards could be used with conventional spectrophotometric vibriocidal methods, and that they correlated with paired serum at a wide range of titers (r = 0.96, p<0.0001). Similarly, we used ELISA methods to show that V. cholerae O-specific polysaccharide antibody responses from DBS eluates correlated with results from paired serum for IgG (r = 0.85, p = 0.00006), IgM (r = 0.79, p = 0.00049) and IgA (r = 0.73, p = 0.0019), highlighting its potential for use in determination of isotype-specific responses.

In this study, we have investigated the deleterious effects of BH4 deficiency on retinal vasculature during development.Methods
hph-1 mice, which display deficiency in BH4 synthesis, were used to characterize the inflammatory effects and the integrity of retinal microvasculature. BH4 levels in retinas from hph-1 and wild type ﻿(WT)﻿ mice were measured by LC-MS/MS. Retinal microvascular area and microglial cells number were quantified in hph-1 and WT mice at different ages. Retinal expression of pro-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and neuronal-derived factors was analyzed by qPCR. BH4 supplementation was evaluated in vitro, ex-vivo, and in vivo models.ResultsOur findings demonstrated that BH4 levels in the retina from hph-1 mice were significantly lower by ~ 90% at all ages analyzed compared to WT mice. Juvenile hph-1 mice showed iris atrophy, persistent fetal vasculature, significant increase in the number of microglial cells (p < 0.01), as well as a marked degeneration of the retinal microvasculature. Retinal microvascular alterations in juvenile hph-1 mice were associated with a decreased expression in Norrin (0.2-fold) and its receptor Frizzled-4 (FZD4; 0.51-fold), as well as with an augmented expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-6 (3.2-fold), NRLP-3 (4.4-fold), IL-1β (8.6-fold), and the anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1; 17.5-fold). We found that TSP-1 derived from activated microglial cells is a factor responsible of inducing microvascular degeneration, but BH4 supplementation markedly prevented hyperoxia-induced microglial activation in vitro and microvascular injury in an ex-vivo model of microvascular angiogenesis and an in vivo model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR).ConclusionOur findings reveal that BH4 is a key cofactor in regulating the expression of inflammatory and anti-angiogenic factors that play an important function in the maintenance of retinal microvasculature.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12974-017-0955-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Tetrahydrobiopterin, BH4, Microvascular degeneration, Thrombospondin-1, Inflammation, Microglia",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5586016/

Primary objectives were to determine early predictors of autism risk to identify children with TSC in most need of early interventions. The Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI) was evaluated as a measure of ASD-associated behaviors in infants with TSC at age 12 months and its ability to predict ASD at 24 months.MethodsChildren ages 0 to 36 months with TSC were enrolled in the TSC Autism Center of Excellence Research Network (TACERN), a multicenter, prospective observational study to identify biomarkers of ASD. The AOSI was administered at age 12 months and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) at 24 months. Developmental functioning was assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Children were classified as ASD or non-ASD according to the ADOS-2.ResultsAnalysis included 79 children who had been administered the AOSI at 12 months and ADOS-2 and ADI-R at 24 months. The ASD group had a mean AOSI total score at 12 months significantly higher than the non-ASD group (11.8 ± 7.4 vs. 6.3 ± 4.7; p<0.001). An AOSI total score cut-off of 13 provided a specificity of 0.89 to detect ASD with the ADOS-2. AOSI total score at 12 months was similarly associated with exceeding cut-off scores on the ADI-R.ConclusionsThe AOSI is a useful clinical tool in determining which infants with TSC are at increased risk for developing ASD.Keywords: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, autism spectrum disorder, Autism Observational Scale for Infants, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, infants, toddlers",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5610103/

The inability to metabolize galactose results in galactosemia. Galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects newborns who are born asymptomatic, apparently well and healthy, then develop serious morbidity and mortality upon consuming milk that contains galactose. Those with galactosemia have a deficiency of an enzyme: classic galactosemia (type 1) results from severe deficiency of galactose-1-uridylyltransferase, while galactosemia type II results from galactokinase deficiency and type III results from galactose epimerase deficiency. Many countries include neonatal screening for galactosemia in their national newborn screening program; however, others do not, as the condition is rather rare, with an incidence of 1:30,000–1:100,000, and screening may be seen as not cost-effective and logistically demanding. Early detection and intervention by restricting galactose is not curative but is very rewarding, as it prevents deaths, mental retardation, liver cell failure, renal tubular acidosis and neurological sequelae, and may lead to resolution of cataract formation. Hence, national newborn screening for galactosemia prevents serious potential life-long suffering, morbidity and mortality.

They can be represented as primary, secondary, tertiary, and even quaternary structures, but from a nutritional viewpoint only the primary (amino acid) sequence is of interest. Similarly, although there are many compounds in the body that can be chemically defined as amino acids, we are only concerned with the 20 canonical amino acids encoded in DNA, plus 5 others—ornithine, citrulline, γ-aminobutyrate, β-alanine, and taurine—that play quantitatively important roles in the body. We consume proteins, which are digested in the gastrointestinal tract, absorbed as small peptides (di- and tripeptides) and free amino acids, and then used for the resynthesis of proteins in our cells. Additionally, some amino acids are also used for the synthesis of specific (nonprotein) products, such as nitric oxide, polyamines, creatine, glutathione, nucleotides, glucosamine, hormones, neurotransmitters, and other factors. Again, such functions are not quantitatively important for most amino acids, and the bulk of amino acid metabolism is directly related to protein turnover (synthesis and degradation). For an individual in nitrogen balance, an amount of protein equal to that of the daily protein (nitrogen) intake is degraded each day with the nitrogen being excreted as urea and ammonia (with limited amounts of creatinine and uric acid). The carbon skeletons of the amino acids degraded to urea and ammonia are recovered through gluconeogenesis or ketone synthesis, or oxidized to carbon dioxide. Of the 20 amino acids present in proteins, 9 are considered nutritionally indispensable (essential) in adult humans because the body is not able to synthesize their carbon skeletons. These 9 amino acids are leucine, valine, isoleucine, histidine, lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. In addition, 2 others are made from their indispensable precursors: cysteine from methionine, and tyrosine from phenylalanine. Although arginine is needed in neonates, it appears that adults, with the possible exceptions of pregnancy in females and spermatogenesis in males, can synthesize sufficient arginine to maintain a nitrogen balance. The others, glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, asparagine, serine, glycine, proline, and alanine, can all be synthesized from glucose and a suitable nitrogen source. Under some conditions, glutamine, glutamate, glycine, proline, and arginine may be considered as conditionally indispensable, meaning that the body is not capable of synthesizing them in sufficient quantities for a specific physiologic or pathologic condition (1). Thus, any discussion of dietary protein must consider not only quantity but also quality (ratio of indispensable amino acids).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6140426/

To learn what is already known about these views, we conducted a systematic review, which ultimately analyzed 53 studies involving the perspectives of 47,974 participants on real or hypothetical privacy issues related to human genetic data. Bibliographic databases included MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, and Sociological Abstracts. Three investigators independently screened studies against predetermined criteria and assessed risk of bias. The picture of genetic privacy that emerges from this systematic literature review is complex and riddled with gaps. When asked specifically “are you worried about genetic privacy,” the general public, patients, and professionals frequently said yes. In many cases, however, that question was posed poorly or only in the most general terms. While many participants expressed concern that genomic and medical information would be revealed to others, respondents frequently seemed to conflate privacy, confidentiality, control, and security. People varied widely in how much control they wanted over the use of data. They were more concerned about use by employers, insurers, and the government than they were about researchers and commercial entities. In addition, people are often willing to give up some privacy to obtain other goods.

To compare the study groups (CH type) in terms of quantitative and qualitative variables, the t-test and Chi-square test were used, respectively using the SPSS22. P-value <0.05 was considered as significant.ResultsOf 269,088 infants screened during the study period, 548 infants with primary congenital hypothyroidism were identified (a prevalence of 1 per 491 births) and congenital hypothyroidism was definitively diagnosed in 389 children (a prevalence of 1 per 453 births); of them, 169 had permanent CH (a prevalence of 1 per 1043 births) and 220 had transient CH (a prevalence of 1 per 801 births). The female to male ratio in the permanent congenital hypothyroidism group was higher than that in the transient congenital hypothyroidism group (p=0.08). The family relationship between mother and father was stronger in the permanent congenital hypothyroidism group than in the transient congenital hypothyroidism group (p=0.03).ConclusionThese findings show that congenital hypothyroidism is more prevalent in the north of Iran than in other areas of Iran; the prevalence of transient CH is particularly higher than permanent CH.Keywords: Neonate screening, Congenital hypothyroidism, Permanent, Transient",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5984024/

875,10.1002/mgg3.408,29749107,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundPhenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutations in the PAH gene. Most of the patients are compound heterozygotes, and genotype is a major factor in determining the phenotypic variability of PKU. More than 1,000 variants have been described in the PAH gene. Rio de Janeiro's population has a predominance of Iberian, followed by African and Amerindian ancestries. It is expected that most PKU variants in this Brazilian state have originated in the Iberian Peninsula. However, rare European, African or pathogenic variants that are characteristic of the admixed population of the state might also be found.MethodsA total of 102 patients were included in this study. Genomic DNA was isolated from dried blood spots. Sanger sequencing was used for PAH gene variant identification. Deletions and duplications were also screened using MLPA analysis. Haplotypes were also determined.ResultsNine (8.8%) homozygous and 93 (91.2%) compound heterozygous patients were found. The spectrum included 37 causative mutations. Missense, nonsense, and splicing pathogenic variants corresponded to 63.7%, 2.9%, and 22.6% of the mutant alleles, respectively. Large (1.5%), and small deletions, inframe (5.4%) and with frameshift (3.9%), comprised the remainder. The most frequent pathogenic variants were: p.V388M (12.7%), p.R261Q (11.8%), IVS10‐11G>A (10.3%), IVS2+5G>C (6.4%), p.S349P (6.4%), p.R252W (5.4%), p.I65T (4.4%), p.T323del (4.4%), and p.P281L (3.4%). One novel variant was detected: c.934G>T (p.G312C) [rs763115697].ConclusionThe three most frequent pathogenic variants in our study (34.8% of the alleles) were also the most common in other Brazilian states, Portugal, and Spain (p.V388M, p.R261Q, IVS10‐11G>A), corroborating that the Iberian Peninsula is the major source of PAH mutations in Rio de Janeiro. Pathogenic variants that have other geographical origins, such IVS2+5G>C, p.G352Vfs*48, and IVS12+1G>A were also detected.

Spatial clustering of PKU cases was analysed using global and local spatial autocorrelation analysis in the geographic information system.ResultsThe database contained 4925 neonates with confirmed PKU during the study period, corresponding to an incidence of 6.28 (95% CI: 6.11 to 6.46) per 100 000 neonates screened. Incidence was highest in the provinces of Gansu, Ningxia and Qinghai, where it ranged from 19.00 to 28.63 per 100 000 neonates screened. Overall incidence was higher in the northern part of the country, where classical disease predominated, than in the southern part, where mild disease predominated. PKU cases clustered spatially (global Moran’s I=0.3603, Z=5.3097, p<0.001), and local spatial autocorrelation identified four northern provinces as high–high clusters (Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia and Shanxi).ConclusionsChina shows an intermediate PKU incidence among countries, and incidence differs substantially among Chinese provinces and between northern and southern regions.

PM is expensive and health budgets are constrained - efficient healthcare delivery is therefore critical. Notwithstanding the cost, many countries have started to adopt this novel technology, including resource-limited Southeast Asia (SEA) countries. This study aimed to describe the status of PM adoption in SEA, highlight the challenges and to propose strategies for future development.MethodsThe study included scoping review and key stakeholder interviews in four focus countries – Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. The current landscape of PM adoption was evaluated based on an assessment framework of six key themes – healthcare system, governance, access, awareness, implementation, and data. Six PM programs were evaluated for their financing and implementation mechanisms.ResultsThe findings revealed SEA has progressed in adopting PM especially Singapore and Thailand. A regional pharmacogenomics research network has been established. However, PM policies and programs vary significantly. As most PM programs are champion-driven and the available funding is limited, the current PM distribution has the potential to widen existing health disparities. Low PM awareness in the society and the absence of political support with financial investment are fundamental barriers. There is a clear need to broaden opportunities for critical discourse about PM especially for policymakers. Multi-stakeholder, multi-country strategies need to be prioritized in order to leverage resources and expertise.ConclusionsAdopting PM remains in its infancy in SEA. To achieve an effective PM adoption, it is imperative to balance equity issues across diverse populations while improving efficiency in healthcare.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12920-018-0420-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Personalized medicine, Pharmacogenomics, Implementation, Southeast Asia",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6203971/

Plasma DβH activity, however, was normal and the DBH gene had no mutations. Molecular genetic analysis was performed to determine the underlying genetic cause. Homozygosity mapping and exome and Sanger sequencing revealed pathogenic homozygous mutations in the gene encoding cytochrome b561 (CYB561); a missense variant c.262G>A, p.Gly88Arg in exon 3 in the Dutch family and a nonsense mutation (c.131G>A, p.Trp44*) in exon 2 in the American family. Expression of CYB561 was investigated using RNA from different human adult and fetal tissues, transcription of RNA into cDNA and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The CYB561 gene was found to be expressed in many human tissues, in particular the brain. The CYB561 protein defect leads to a shortage of ascorbate inside the catecholamine secretory vesicles leading to a functional DβH deficiency. The concentration of the catecholamines and downstream metabolites was measured in brain and adrenal tissue of six CYB561 knockout mice (reporter-tagged deletion allele (post-Cre), genetic background C57BL/6NTac). The concentration of norepinephrine and normetanephrine was decreased in whole brain homogenates of the CYB561(−/−) mice compared to wild type mice (p<0.01) and the concentration of normetanephrine and metanephrine was decreased in adrenal glands (p<0.01), recapitulating the clinical phenotype. The patients responded favorably to treatment with L-dihydroxyphenylserine, which can be converted directly to norepinephrine.ConclusionsThis study is the first to implicate cytochrome b561 in disease by showing that pathogenic mutations in CYB561 cause an as yet unknown disease in neurotransmitter metabolism causing orthostatic hypotension.Keywords: Orthostatic hypotension, catecholamines, dopamine β-hydroxylase, CYB561, sympathetic nervous system, hypotensin, low blood pressure, adrenergic regulation, dopamine, genetics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5924476/

Methods: Sixteen patients with PKU, median age is 12.5 (range 5–20.6) years, were recruited into this cross-sectional study. TBW was measured by both deuterium dilution and BIA on the same occasion as per a standard protocol. FFM was estimated from predictive equations.
Results: There was no significant difference between TBWDeut and TBWBIA (p = 0.344) or FFMDeut and FFMBIA (p = 0.111). TBWDeut and TBWBIA were highly correlated (r = 0.990, p < 0.0001), as were FFMDeut and FFMBIA (r = 0.984, p < 0.0001).

Aim: To study the impact of CGMP-AA on blood Phe variability using 3 different dietary regimens in children with PKU. Methods: This was a 6-week randomised controlled cross-over study comparing CGMP-AA vs. Phe-free l-amino acids (l-AA) assessing blood Phe and tyrosine (Tyr) variability over 24 h in 19 children (7 boys) with PKU, with a median age of 10 years (6–16). Subjects were randomised to 3 dietary regimens: (1) R1, CGMP-AA and usual dietary Phe (CGMP + Phe); (2) R2, CGMP-AA − Phe content of CGMP-AA from usual diet (CGMP − Phe); and (3) R3, l-AA and usual dietary Phe. Each regimen was administered for 14 days. Over the last 48 h on days 13 and 14, blood spots were collected every 4 h at 08 h, 12 h, 16 h, 20 h, 24 h, and 04 h. Isocaloric intake and the same meal plan and protein substitute dosage at standardised times were maintained when blood spots were collected. Results: Eighteen children completed the study. Median Phe concentrations over 24 h for each group were (range) R1, 290 (30–580), R2, 220 (10–670), R3, 165 (10–640) μmol/L. R1 vs. R2 and R1 vs. R3 p < 0.0001; R2 vs. R3 p = 0.0009. There was a significant difference in median Phe at each time point between R1 vs. R2, p = 0.0027 and R1 vs. R3, p < 0.0001, but not between any time points for R2 vs. R3. Tyr was significantly higher in both R1 and R2 [70 (20–240 μmol/L] compared to R3 [60 (10–200) μmol/L]. In children < 12 years, blood Phe remained in the target range (120–360 μmol/L), over 24 h, for 75% of the time in R1, 72% in R2 and 64% in R3; for children aged ≥ 12 years, blood Phe was in target range (120–600 μmol/L) in R1 and R2 for 100% of the time, but 64% in R3. Conclusions: The residual Phe in CGMP-AA increased blood Phe concentration in children. CGMP-AA appears to give less blood Phe variability compared to l-AA, but this effect may be masked by the increased blood Phe concentrations associated with its Phe contribution. Reducing dietary Phe intake to compensate for CGMP-AA Phe content may help.Keywords: glycomacropeptide, phenylalanine, phenylketonuria, phenylalanine variability, amino acids, tyrosine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6471794/

What is more, the complexity and diversity provided by the developmental period only adds to this contention. The development of executive function plays an integral part in the expression of children's behavioral, cognitive, social, and emotional capabilities. Understanding how these processes are constructed during development allows for effective measurement of EF in this population. This meta-analysis aims to contribute to a better understanding of the structure of executive function in children. A coordinate-based meta-analysis was conducted (using BrainMap GingerALE 2.3), which incorporated studies administering functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during inhibition, switching, and working memory updating tasks in typical children (aged 6–18 years). The neural activation common across all executive tasks was compared to that shared by tasks pertaining only to inhibition, switching or updating, which are commonly considered to be fundamental executive processes. Results support the existence of partially separable but partially overlapping inhibition, switching, and updating executive processes at a neural level, in children over 6 years. Further, the shared neural activation across all tasks (associated with a proposed “unitary” component of executive function) overlapped to different degrees with the activation associated with each individual executive process. These findings provide evidence to support the suggestion that one of the most influential structural models of executive functioning in adults can also be applied to children of this age. However, the findings also call for careful consideration and measurement of both specific executive processes, and unitary executive function in this population. Furthermore, a need is highlighted for a new systematic developmental model, which captures the integrative nature of executive function in children.Keywords: executive function, fMRI, children, ALE meta-analysis, inhibition, switching, updating, cognitive control",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5383671/

We applied NewbornDiscovery (SD Genomics), an integrated workflow design that encompasses analyte-phenotype-gene, single nucleotide variant/small insertion and deletion/copy number variation analyses along with clinical interpretation of genetic variants related to each participant's condition.ResultsA molecular genetic diagnosis was established in 95% (19/20) of individuals. In Group 1, 13 and 7 of 20 alleles were classified as pathogenic and likely pathogenic, respectively. In Group 2, 11 and 6 of 17 alleles with identified causative variants were pathogenic and likely pathogenic, respectively. There were no variants of uncertain significance.

Multivitamin/multimineral supplements (MVMS) are widely used by this population, which reduces inadequacies in micronutrient intake, but the potential for exceeding tolerable upper intake levels in others should be considered. There are concerns associated with the excessive intake of certain nutrients, particularly folic acid, and potential untoward consequences. The advent of nutrigenomics and the enhanced ability to directly study the interactions between nutrition and genetic variants and expression will allow for the conduct of more targeted studies with specific endpoints and may ultimately lead to progress in the field of personalized nutrition. The role of MVMS in health maintenance and chronic disease prevention remains controversial. Conducting studies in this area has been hampered by, among other factors, inconsistent definitions of MVMS, ranging from as few as three vitamins to broad-spectrum products containing more than two dozen vitamins and minerals. Results from some observational studies and large-scale, randomized, controlled trials suggest that MVMS may reduce the risk of some forms of cancer and, potentially, cardiovascular disease.

890,10.3892/mmr.2017.7891,29115600,"Go to:AbstractHypoxemia and hypercarbia resulting from a lack of surfactant is considered to be the primary mechanism underlying neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS). Surfactant replacement therapy may mitigate the symptoms of the disease by decreasing the surface tension of alveoli and facilitating inflation. However, surfactant serves an additional role in immunological processes. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that mechanisms of NRDS involving surfactant exert additional functions to promoting alveolar inflation. Using peripheral blood obtained from mature infants with and without NRDS, in tandem with mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) analysis, the present study identified that, while cell cycle regulation and alveolar surfactants serve a role in deterring the further onset of NRDS, innate and pathogen-induced responses of the immune system are among the most important factors in the pathology. The present study illustrated the regulatory importance of these immune pathways in response to alterations in the expression of gene families, particularly in perpetual lung injury leading to NRDS. Notably, data collected from the mRNA-seq analysis revealed similar mechanisms between NRDS and acute respiratory distress syndrome, a clinical phenotype precipitated by the manifestation of a severe form of lung injury due to numerous lung insults, implying that similar therapies may be applied to treat these two diseases.Keywords: mRNA sequencing, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanism",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5780146/

The interplay of de novo and inherited rare variants has been suspected in the development of ASD. Here, we applied whole exome sequencing (WES) on 19 trios from singleton Saudi families with ASD. We developed an analysis pipeline that allows capturing both de novo and inherited rare variants predicted to be deleterious. A total of 47 unique rare variants were detected in 17 trios including 38 which are newly discovered. The majority were either autosomal recessive or X-linked. Our pipeline uncovered variants in 15 ASD-candidate genes, including 5 (GLT8D1, HTATSF1, OR6C65, ITIH6 and DDX26B) that have not been reported in any human condition. The remaining variants occurred in genes formerly associated with ASD or other neurological disorders. Examples include SUMF1, KDM5B and MXRA5 (Known-ASD genes), PRODH2 and KCTD21 (implicated in schizophrenia), as well as USP9X and SMS (implicated in intellectual disability). Consistent with expectation and previous studies, most of the genes implicated herein are enriched for biological processes pertaining to neuronal function.

Therefore, maintaining an appropriate iron balance is essential to ensure sufficient energy production and to avoid excessive reactive oxygen species formation. Iron overload impairs mitochondrial fitness; however, little is known about the associated metabolic changes. Here we aimed to characterize the metabolic signature triggered by dietary iron overload over time in a mouse model, where mice received either a standard or a high-iron diet. Metabolic profiling was assessed in blood, plasma and liver tissue. Peripheral blood was collected by means of volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS). Extracted blood and tissue metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography combined to high resolution mass spectrometry. Upon dietary iron loading we found increased glucose, aspartic acid and 2-/3-hydroxybutyric acid levels but low lactate and malate levels in peripheral blood and plasma, pointing to a re-programming of glucose homeostasis and the Krebs cycle. Further, iron loading resulted in the stimulation of the urea cycle in the liver. In addition, oxidative stress was enhanced in circulation and coincided with increased liver glutathione and systemic cysteine synthesis. Overall, iron supplementation affected several central metabolic circuits over time. Hence, in vivo investigation of metabolic signatures represents a novel and useful tool for getting deeper insights into iron-dependent regulatory circuits and for monitoring of patients with primary and secondary iron overload, and those ones receiving iron supplementation therapy.Keywords: iron, metabolomics, VAMS, mitochondria, glucose, urea cycle, oxidative stress",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315421/

Age-related changes, as well as those associated with disease progression, often appear first in the cutaneous circulation. Furthermore, impaired vascular signaling and attendant endothelial dysfunction, the earliest indicators of cardiovascular pathogenesis, occur in a similar fashion across multiple tissue beds throughout the body, including the skin. Because microvascular dysfunction is a better predictor of long-term outcomes and adverse cardiovascular events than is large vessel disease, an understanding of age-associated changes in the control of the human cutaneous microcirculation is important. This review focuses on 1) the merits of using skin-specific methods and techniques to study vascular function, 2) microvascular changes in aged skin (in particular, the role of the endothelial-derived dilator nitric oxide), and 3) the impact of aging on heat-induced changes in skin vasodilation. While skin blood flow is controlled by multiple, often redundant, mechanisms, our laboratory has used a variety of distinct thermal provocations of this model circulation to isolate specific age-associated changes in vascular function. Skin-specific approaches and techniques, such as intradermal microdialysis coupled with laser-Doppler flowmetry (in vivo) and biochemical analyses of skin biopsy samples (in vitro), have allowed for the targeted pharmacodissection of the mechanistic pathways controlling skin vasoreactivity and study of the impact of aging and disease states.

Many follow a low-phenylalanine (low-Phe) diet devoid of animal protein in combination with medical foods (MFs).ObjectiveTo assess lipid metabolism in participants with PKU consuming amino acid MFs (AA-MFs) or glycomacropeptide MFs (GMP-MFs), we conducted fatty acid and metabolomics analyses.MethodsWe used subsets of fasting plasma and urine samples from our randomized crossover trial in which participants with early-treated classical and variant (milder) PKU consumed a low-Phe diet combined with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs for 3 wk each. Fatty acid profiles of red blood cell (RBC) membranes were determined for 25 adults (aged 18–49 y) with PKU and 143 control participants. Metabolomics analyses of plasma and urine samples were conducted by Metabolon for 9–10 adolescent and adult participants with PKU and for 15 control participants.ResultsRBC fatty acid profiles were not significantly different with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs. PKU participants showed higher total n–6:n–3 (ω-6:ω-3) fatty acids (mean ± SD percentages of total fatty acids: AA-MF = 5.45% ± 1.07%; controls = 4.33%; P < 0.001) and lower docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; AA-MF = 3.21% ± 0.98%; controls = 3.70% ± 1.01%; P = 0.02) and eicosapentaenoic acid (AA-MF = 0.33% ± 0.12%; controls = 0.60% ± 0.43%; P < 0.001) in RBCs than did control participants. Despite higher carnitine intake from AA-MFs than GMP-MFs (mean ± SE intake: AA-MFs = 58.6 ± 5.3 mg/d; GMP-MFs = 0.3 ± 0.01 mg/d; P < 0.001), plasma concentrations of carnitine were similar and not different from those in the control group (AA-MF compared with GMP-MF, P = 0.73). AA-MFs resulted in higher urinary excretion of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is synthesized by bacteria from carnitine, compared with GMP-MFs (mean ± SE scaled intensity—TMAO: AA-MFs = 1.2 ± 0.1, GMP-MFs = 0.9 ± 0.1; P = 0.005). Plasma deoxycarnitine was lower in PKU participants than in control participants, suggesting reduced carnitine biosynthesis in PKU (AA-MF = 0.9 ± 0.1; GMP-MF = 1.0 ± 0.1; controls = 1.3 ± 0.1; AA-MF compared with controls, P = 0.01; GMP-MF compared with controls, P = 0.04).ConclusionsSupplementation with DHA is needed in PKU.

However, the factors that influence these decisions are poorly understood. This is particularly true for dietary proteins, which are important determinants of lifespan and reproduction. We show that in Drosophila melanogaster, essential amino acids (eAAs) and the concerted action of the commensal bacteria Acetobacter pomorum and Lactobacilli are critical modulators of food choice. Using a chemically defined diet, we show that the absence of any single eAA from the diet is sufficient to elicit specific appetites for amino acid (AA)-rich food. Furthermore, commensal bacteria buffer the animal from the lack of dietary eAAs: both increased yeast appetite and decreased reproduction induced by eAA deprivation are rescued by the presence of commensals. Surprisingly, these effects do not seem to be due to changes in AA titers, suggesting that gut bacteria act through a different mechanism to change behavior and reproduction. Thus, eAAs and commensal bacteria are potent modulators of feeding decisions and reproductive output. This demonstrates how the interaction of specific nutrients with the microbiome can shape behavioral decisions and life history traits.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5404834/

With medication (nitisinone) and dietary restrictions outcomes are improved. We conducted a systematic review to investigate if treatment with nitisinone following screening provides better long-term outcomes than treatment with nitisinone following symptomatic detection.MethodsWe searched Web of Science, Medline, Pre-Medline, and Embase up to 23rd September 2016 for journal articles comparing clinical outcomes of TYR1 patients receiving earlier versus later nitisinone treatment. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed full texts, and appraised study quality. Data extraction was performed by a single reviewer and checked by a second.ResultsWe included seven articles out of 470 unique records identified by our search. The seven articles included four studies (three cohort studies and one cross-sectional study). Study sample sizes ranged from 17 to 148. There is consistent evidence that nitisinone is an effective treatment for TYR1, and some evidence that earlier treatment with nitisinone and dietary restrictions within the first one or 2 months of life is associated with reduced need for liver transplantation, lower rates of renal dysfunction, fewer neurological crises, and fewer, shorter hospital admissions compared to later treatment. However, study quality was moderate to weak, with high risk of confounding and applicability concerns to the screening context. We conducted post hoc analyses to address these issues. Results suggested an association between earlier treatment and fewer liver transplants (earlier treatment: 0% of 10–24 patients; later treatment: 25–60% of 4–15 patients), but no impact on neurological crises.

In the present study, we investigate the role of BH4 in the regulation of BAT. Hph-1 mice, a mouse model of BH4 deficiency, exhibit obesity, adiposity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and impaired BAT function. Impaired BAT function was ameliorated together with systemic metabolic disturbances by BAT transplantation from BH4-sufficient mice (control mice) into BH4-deficient mice, strongly suggesting that BH4-induced BAT has a critical role in the regulation of systemic energy metabolism. Both NA derived from the sympathetic nerve and NO derived from endothelial NOS in the blood vessels participate in the regulation of BH4. In addition, a direct effect of BH4 in the stimulation of brown adipocytes via NO is implicated. Taken together, BH4 activates BAT and regulates systemic energy metabolism; this suggests an approach for metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes.Keywords: Metabolism",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5414566/

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PPARGC1A), a coactivator of the transcription factor PPAR-γ that controls mitochondrial biogenesis and function, has a pivotal role in the early dysfunction of the proximal tubule and the subsequent renal repair. Here, we evaluated the potential role of hepatocyte nuclear factor–1β (HNF-1β) in regulating PPARGC1A expression in AKI. In mice, endotoxin injection to induce AKI also induced early and transient inflammation and PPARGC1A inhibition, which overlapped with downregulation of the HNF-1β transcriptional network. In vitro, exposure of proximal tubule cells to the inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α led to inhibition of HNF-1β transcriptional activity. Moreover, inhibition of HNF-1β significantly reduced PPARGC1A expression and altered mitochondrial morphology and respiration in proximal tubule cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and PCR analysis confirmed HNF-1β binding to the Ppargc1a promoter in mouse kidneys. We also demonstrated downregulation of renal PPARGC1A expression in a patient with an HNF1B germinal mutation. Thus, we propose that HNF-1β links extracellular inflammatory signals to mitochondrial dysfunction during AKI partly via PPARGC1A signaling. Our findings further strengthen the view of HNF1B-related nephropathy as a mitochondrial disorder in adulthood.Keywords: HNF1B, acute kidney injury, mitochondria, PPARGC1A",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5661272/

Although significant progress has been made in the development of DDSs for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, new approaches that increase the scope and effectiveness of such systems are still needed. Concepts such as nanoreactors and nanofactories are therefore attracting much attention. Nanoreactors, which basically consist of vesicle‐encapsulated enzymes, provide prodrug conversion to therapeutic agents rather than simple drug delivery. Nanofactories are an extension of this concept and combine the features of nanoreactors and delivery carriers. Here, the required features of nanofactories are discussed and an overview of current strategies for the design and fabrication of different types of nanoreactors, i.e., systems based on lipid or polymer vesicles, capsules, mesoporous silica, viral capsids, and hydrogels, and their respective advantages and shortcomings, is provided.

Patients are comatose, often with fever, recurrent seizures and this condition is associated with a high mortality rate. The etiology of the coma and seizures are poorly understood. Circulating small molecules and lipids have bioactive functions and alterations in their concentrations have been implicated in seizure disorders and other forms of encephalopathy. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of blood metabolites during CM to explore a biochemical basis of this encephalopathy. A paired metabolomics analysis was performed on the plasma samples of Malawian children (n = 11) during CM and at convalescence thirty days later, to identify differentially abundant molecules associated with CM. We also report plasma molecules associated with CM mortality (n = 4) compared to survival (n = 19). Plasma metabolites were identified through ultra high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to maximize compound detection and accuracy and then compared to a library for identification. We detected a total of 432 small molecules in the plasma and 247 metabolites were significantly differentially abundant between CM and convalescence (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.10). These represented global changes across many classes of molecules including lipids, amino acids and hemoglobin metabolites. We observed significant changes in molecules that could impact neurologic function during CM; these include increased levels of kynurenate and decreased indolepropionate, glutamate, arginine and glutamine. Moreover, 1-methylimidazoleacetate, kyurenate, arachidonic acid and dimethylarginine were associated with mortality (p < 0.05, fold change > 1.2).

Neonatal screening for CAH is effective in detecting the salt-wasting (SW) form and in reducing mortality. In this study, our aim was to estimate the incidence of CAH in Turkey and to assess the characteristics and efficacy of the adopted newborn CAH screening strategy.Methods:A pilot newborn CAH screening study was carried out under the authority of the Turkish Directorate of Public Health. Newborn babies of ≥32 gestational weeks and ≥1500 gr birth weight from four cities, born between March 27-September 15, 2017 were included in the study. Screening protocol included one sample two-tier testing. In the first step, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) was measured by fluoroimmunoassay in dried blood spots (DBS) obtained at 3-5 days of life. The cases with positive initial screening were tested by steroid profiling in DBS using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to measure 17-OHP, 21-deoxycortisol (21-S), cortisol (F), 11-deoxycortisol and androstenedione as a second-tier test. The babies with a steroid ratio (21-S+17-OHP)/F of ≥0.5 were referred to pediatric endocrinology clinics for diagnostic assessment.Results:38,935 infants were tested, 2265 (5.82%) required second-tier testing and 212 (0.54%) were referred for clinical assessment, six of whom were diagnosed with CAH (four males, two females). Four cases were identified as SW 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) (two males, two females). One male baby had simple virilizing 21-OHD and one male baby had 11-OHD CAH. The incidence of classical 21-OHD in the screened population was 1:7,787.Conclusion:The incidence of CAH due to classical 21-OHD is higher in Turkey compared to previous reports. We, therefore, suggest that CAH be added to the newborn screening panel in Turkey.

Similarly, male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to social defeat in mid-adolescence (P35-39) show impaired working memory in adulthood (P56-70), along with decreased medial PFC (mPFC) dopamine activity that results in part from increased dopamine transporter-mediated clearance. Here, we determined if dopamine synthesis and D2 autoreceptor-mediated inhibition of dopamine release in the adult mPFC are also enhanced by adolescent defeat to contribute to later dopamine hypofunction. Control and previously defeated rats did not differ in either DOPA accumulation following amino acid decarboxylase inhibition (NSD-1015 100 mg/kg ip.) or total/phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase protein expression, suggesting dopamine synthesis in the adult mPFC is not altered by adolescent defeat. However, exposure to adolescent defeat caused greater decreases in extracellular dopamine release (measured using in vivo chronoamperometry) in the adult mPFC upon local infusion of the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole (3 nM), implying greater D2 autoreceptor function. Equally enhanced D2 autoreceptor-mediated inhibition of dopamine release is seen in the adolescent (P40 or P49) mPFC, which declines in control rats by adulthood. However, this developmental decrease in autoreceptor function is absent following adolescent defeat, suggesting retention of an adolescent-like phenotype into adulthood. Current and previous findings indicate adolescent defeat decreases extracellular dopamine availability in the adult mPFC via both enhanced inhibition of dopamine release and increased dopamine clearance, which may be viable targets for improving treatment of cognitive deficits seen in neuropsychiatric disorders promoted by adolescent stress.Keywords: Bullying, Social defeat, Tyrosine hydroxylase, Dopamine transporter",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6105450/

As a result, IEM may contribute significantly to the burden of non-communicable childhood morbidity.MethodsWe conducted a systematic literature review of birth prevalence and case fatality of IEM globally, with search dates set from 1980 to 2017. Using random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated birth prevalence of separate classes of IEM and all-cause IEM, split by geographical region. We also estimated levels of parental consanguinity in IEM cases and global case fatality rates and resultant child deaths from all-cause IEM.Findings49 studies met our selection criteria. We estimate the global birth prevalence of all-cause IEM to be 50.9 per 100 000 live births (95% confidence intervals (CI) = 43.4-58.4). Regional pooled birth prevalence rates showed the highest rates of IEM to be in the Eastern Mediterranean region (75.7 per 100 000 live births, 95% CI = 50.0-101.4), correlating with a higher observed rate of parental consanguinity in studies from this area.

There is controversy over whether obese “metabolically well” persons have a higher morbidity and mortality than lean counterparts, suggesting that MS criteria do not completely describe physiologic risk factors or consequences of obesity. We hypothesized that metabolomic analysis of plasma would distinguish obese individuals with and without MS and T2D along a spectrum of obesity-associated metabolic derangements, supporting metabolomic analysis as a tool for a more detailed assessment of metabolic wellness than currently used MS criteria.MethodsFasting plasma samples from 90 adults were assigned to groups based on BMI and ATP III criteria for MS: (1) lean metabolically well (LMW; n = 24); (2) obese metabolically well (OBMW; n = 26); (3) obese metabolically unwell (OBMUW; n = 20); and (4) obese metabolically unwell with T2D (OBDM; n = 20). Forty-one amino acids/dipeptides, 33 acylcarnitines and 21 ratios were measured. Obesity and T2D effects were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests comparing obese nondiabetics vs LMW, and OBDM vs nondiabetics, respectively. Metabolic unwellness was analyzed by Jonckheere-Terpstra trend tests, assuming worsening health from LMW → OBMW → OBMUW. To adjust for multiple comparisons, statistical significance was set at p < 0.005. K-means cluster analysis of aggregated amino acid and acylcarnitine data was also performed.ResultsAnalytes and ratios significantly increasing in obesity, T2D, and with worsening health include: branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), cystine, alpha-aminoadipic acid, phenylalanine, leucine + lysine, and short-chain acylcarnitines/total carnitines. Tyrosine, alanine and propionylcarnitine increase with obesity and metabolic unwellness. Asparagine and the tryptophan/large neutral amino acid ratio decrease with T2D and metabolic unwellness. Malonylcarnitine decreases in obesity and 3-OHbutyrylcarnitine increases in T2D; neither correlates with unwellness. Cluster analysis did not separate subjects into discreet groups based on metabolic wellness.DiscussionLevels of 15 species and metabolite ratios trend significantly with worsening metabolic health; some are newly recognized. BCAAs, aromatic amino acids, lysine, and its metabolite, alpha-aminoadipate, increase with worsening health. The lysine pathway is distinct from BCAA metabolism, indicating that biochemical derangements associated with MS involve pathways besides those affected by BCAAs. Even those considered “obese, metabolically well” had metabolite levels which significantly trended towards those found in obese diabetics. Overall, this analysis yields a more granular view of metabolic wellness than the sole use of cardiometabolic MS parameters.

Background: Biallelic mutations in DNAJC12 were recently identified as a BH4-responsive cause of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). Outcome was only favorable when treatment was initiated early in life. We report on a 15-year-old boy with HPA due to a homozygous deletion in DNAJC12 in whom – despite his advanced age – treatment was initiated.
Case: A boy with developmental delay, an extrapyramidal movement disorder, and persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine levels was diagnosed with DNAJC12 deficiency at the age of 15 years. Diagnosis was made upon exome reanalysis revealing a homozygous 6.9 kb deletion in DNAJC12 which had not been detected by the standard exome analysis pipeline. Treatment with the BH4 analog sapropterin dihydrochloride (10 mg/kg/day) was initiated and evoked a 50% reduction of the plasma phenylalanine levels. More strikingly, a marked improvement in daily functioning and improved exercise tolerance was noted. Additionally, gait analysis before and after treatment initiation revealed a partial normalization of his movement disorder.
Conclusion: Patients with hyperphenylalaninemia due to DNAJC12 deficiency may benefit from treatment with a BH4 analog – even when introduced at a later age.Keywords: DNAJC12, Hyperphenylalaninemia, Sapropterin dihydrochloride, Tetrahydrobiopterin, Treatment",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6226397/

We reviewed the literature on adult-onset MERS in order to describe the characteristics of MERS in adults and to provide experiences for clinician.MethodsWe reported a case of adult-onset MERS with acute urinary retension and performed literature search from PubMed and web of science databases to identify other adult-onset MERS reports from Januarary 2004 to March 2016. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed on selection process. And then we summarized the clinico-radiological features of adult-onset MERS.ResultsTwenty-nine adult-onset MERS cases were reviewed from available literature including the case we have. 86.2% of the cases (25/29) were reported in Asia, especially in Japan. Ages varied between 18 and 59 years old with a 12:17 female-to-male ratio. The major cause was infection by virus or bacteria. Fever and headache were the most common clinical manifestation, and acute urinary retention was observed in 6 patients. All patients recovered completely within a month.ConclusionAdult-onset MERS is an entity with a broad clinico-radiological spectrum because of the various diseases and conditions. There are similar characteristics between MERS in adults and children, also some differences.Keywords: Mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion, Adult-onset MERS, Encephalitis, Encephalopathy, Corpus callosum, Reversible plenial lesion",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5445341/

Sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac) is recognized as a “self” marker by major serum protein complement factor H and shows reduced interaction with the innate immune system via sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec), which is known as one of the significant regulators of phagocytic evasion. Accordingly, we prepared different surface-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and investigated the effects of sialic acid on cellular and immune responses of nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Sialic acid modification not only facilitates evasion of the RES by suppressing the immune response, but also enhances tumor accumulation via its active targeting ability. Therefore, sialic acid modification presents a promising strategy to advance nanotechnology towards the prospect of clinical translation.Keywords: sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac), anti-recognition effect, evading phagocytosis, lectin targeting, molecular imaging, positron emission tomography (PET).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381258/
931,10.1002/mrd.22880,28834577,"Go to:AbstractOrthologous phenotypes, or phenologs, are seemingly unrelated phenotypes generated by mutations in a conserved set of genes. Phenologs have been widely observed and accepted by those who study model organisms, and allow one to study a set of genes in a model organism to learn more about the function of those genes in other organisms, including humans. At the cellular and molecular level, these conserved genes likely function in a very similar mode, but are doing so in different tissues or cell types and can result in different phenotypic effects. For example, the RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK pathway in animals is a highly conserved signaling pathway that animals adopted for numerous biological processes, such as vulval induction in Caenorhabditis elegans and cell proliferation in mammalian cells; but, this same gene set has been co-opted to function in a variety of cellular contexts. In this review, I will give a few examples of how suppressor screens in model organisms (with a emphasis on C. elegans) can identify new genes that function in a conserved pathway in many other organisms. I will also demonstrate how the identification of such genes can lead to important insights into mammalian biology. From such screens, an occasional silent suppressor that does not cause a phenotype on its own is found; such suppressors thus make for good candidates as therapeutic targets.Keywords: suppression screen, resiliency, rare disease",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5690827/
932,10.1186/s12915-017-0469-0,29325558,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundTranscription factors (TFs), the key players in transcriptional regulation, have attracted great experimental attention, yet the functions of most human TFs remain poorly understood. Recent capabilities in genome-wide protein binding profiling have stimulated systematic studies of the hierarchical organization of human gene regulatory network and DNA-binding specificity of TFs, shedding light on combinatorial gene regulation. We show here that these data also enable a systematic annotation of the biological functions and functional diversity of TFs.ResultWe compiled a human gene regulatory network for 384 TFs covering the 146,096 TF–target gene (TF–TG) relationships, extracted from over 850 ChIP-seq experiments as well as the literature. By integrating this network of TF–TF and TF–TG relationships with 3715 functional concepts from six sources of gene function annotations, we obtained over 9000 confident functional annotations for 279 TFs. We observe extensive connectivity between TFs and Mendelian diseases, GWAS phenotypes, and pharmacogenetic pathways. Further, we show that TFs link apparently unrelated functions, even when the two functions do not share common genes. Finally, we analyze the pleiotropic functions of TFs and suggest that the increased number of upstream regulators contributes to the functional pleiotropy of TFs.ConclusionOur computational approach is complementary to focused experimental studies on TF functions, and the resulting knowledge can guide experimental design for the discovery of unknown roles of TFs in human disease and drug response.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12915-017-0469-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Transcription factor, Regulatory network, Gene function annotation, Functional pleiotropy, Regulator diversity, Target gene, Database, Function enrichment, Co-regulation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5795274/

The endeavour to obtain a catalyst of choice is, however, wrought with challenges. Herein we report the design of a structure-based annotation system for the identification of functionally similar enzymes from diverse sequence backgrounds. Focusing on an enzymatic activity with demonstrated synthetic and therapeutic relevance, five new phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzymes were discovered and characterised with respect to their potential applications. The variation and novelty of various desirable traits seen in these previously uncharacterised enzymes demonstrates the importance of effective sequence annotation in unlocking the potential diversity that Nature provides in the search for tailored biological tools.

936,10.1002/mgg3.610,30829006,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundGenetic heterogeneity and compound heterozygosis give rise to a continuous spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency and metabolic phenotypes in phenylketonuria (PKU). The most used parameters for evaluating phenotype in PKU are pretreatment phenylalanine (Phe) levels, tolerance for dietary Phe, and Phe overloading test. Phenotype can vary from a “classic” (severe) form to mild hyperphenylalaninemia, which does not require dietary treatment. A subset of patients is responsive to treatment by the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Genotypes of PKU patients from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were compared to predicted and observed phenotypes. Genotype‐based estimations of responsiveness to BH4 were also conducted.MethodsPhenotype was defined by pretreatment Phe levels. A standard prediction system based on arbitrary assigned values was employed to measure genotype‐phenotype concordance. Patients were also estimated as BH4‐responders according to the responsiveness previously reported for their mutations and genotypes.ResultsA 48.3% concordance rate between genotype‐predicted and observed phenotypes was found. When the predicted phenotypes included those reported at the BIOPKU database, the concordance rate reached 77%. A total of 18 genotypes from 30 patients (29.4%) were estimated as of potential or probable BH4 responsiveness. Inconsistencies were observed in genotypic combinations including the common “moderate” mutations p.R261Q, p.V388M, and p.I65T and the mild mutations p.L48S, p.R68S, and p.L249F.ConclusionThe high discordance rate between genotype‐predicted and observed metabolic phenotypes in this study seems to be due partially to the high frequency of the so‐called “moderate” common mutations, p.R261Q, p.V388M, and p.I65T, which are reported to be associated to erratic or more severe than expected metabolic phenotypes. Although our results of BH4 estimated responsiveness must be regarded as tentative, it should be emphasized that genotyping and genotype‐phenotype association studies are important in selecting patients to be offered a BH4 overload test, especially in low‐resource settings like Brazil.Keywords: Brazil, genetic association studies, genotype, hyperphenylalaninemia, phenotype, phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylketonuria",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6503030/
937,10.1530/EC-17-0289,29074613,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundThe incidence of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) differs significantly among different ethnicities and regions, and early differentiation of transient CH is important to avoid unnecessary prolonged treatment with L-T4.ObjectiveTo investigate the incidence of CH based on the newborn screening program in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, and to analyze the predictors that might allow for an early differentiation between permanent (P) and transient (T) CH.Design and methodsData from newborn screening program over a seven-year period (January 2009 to January 2016) at Guangxi Maternal and Child Health Hospital are analyzed. Blood samples were collected on filter paper between 3 and 7 days after birth, and TSH level was measured by time-resolved fluorescence assay. Individuals with increased TSH (TSH ≥ 8 IU/L) levels detected by newborn screening were recalled for further evaluation. Serum TSH, FT3 and FT4 were determined by electrochemiluminescence assay using venous blood samples. Diagnosis of CH is based on elevated TSH levels (>10 IU/L) and decreased FT4 levels (<12 pmol/L). Patients with elevated TSH levels and normal FT4 levels were diagnosed as hyperthyrotropinemia. Permanent or transient CH was determined by using the results of thyroid function tests after temporary withdrawal of L-T4 therapy at approximately 2–3 years of age.ResultsAmong 1,238,340 infants in the newborn screening program, 14,443 individuals were recalled for reevaluation (re-call rate 1.18%), 911 and 731 individuals were subsequently determined to have hyperthyrotropinemia and CH respectively; thus, a prevalence of 1:1359 and 1:1694 for hyperthyrotropinemia and CH. Of the 731 patients with CH, 161 patients were diagnosed with permanent CH (PCH), and 159 patients were diagnosed with transient CH (TCH), the other 411 patients are too young to determine their subtypes. Patients with PCH required an increasing dose of L-T4 during the first few years, whereas patients with TCH required a decreased dose of L-T4. The TSH levels at diagnosis and the dose of L-T4 used were significantly higher in PCH cases than in transient cases. The FT4 levels at diagnosis were significantly lower in PCH cases than in TCH cases. The TSH levels at diagnosis, FT4 levels at diagnosis and L-T4 doses at 90 days were evaluated as predictors for differentiating PCH and TCH, and their accuracy at their respective optimal cutoffs were determined to be 60.6%, 66.7% and 93.9%, respectively.ConclusionsThe CH incidence in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is slightly higher (1:1694) compared to the worldwide levels (1/2000–1/4000). The PCH and TCH ratio is close to 1; thus, the estimated PCH incidence is 1/3388, which is similar to reported worldwide average incidence (1/3000). The L-T4 dose required at 90 days (>30 μg/day) has the highest predictive value for PCH. Earlier differentiation of PCH and TCH helps to determine appropriate treatment course.Keywords: congenital hypothyroidism, prevalence, predictor, L-T4 dose, Guangxi, China",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5704446/

An effective medical treatment with 2-[2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl]-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) exists but requires early identification of affected children for optimal long-term results. Newborn screening (NBS) utilizing blood succinylacetone as the NBS marker is superior to observing tyrosine levels as a way of identifying neonates with HT-1. If identified early and treated appropriately, the majority of affected infants can remain asymptomatic. A clinical management scheme is needed for infants with HT-1 identified by NBS or clinical symptoms. To this end, a group of 11 clinical practitioners, including eight biochemical genetics physicians, two metabolic dietitian nutritionists, and a clinical psychologist, from the United States and Canada, with experience in providing care for patients with HT-1, initiated an evidence- and consensus-based process to establish uniform recommendations for identification and treatment of HT-1. Recommendations were developed from a literature review, practitioner management survey, and nominal group process involving two face-to-face meetings. There was strong consensus in favor of NBS for HT-1, using blood succinylacetone as a marker, followed by diagnostic confirmation and early treatment with NTBC and diet. Consensus recommendations for both immediate and long-term clinical follow-up of positive diagnoses via both newborn screening and clinical symptomatic presentation are provided.Keywords: hepatocellular carcinoma, tyrosinemia, newborn screening, nitisinone, NTBC",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5729346/

Due to the implementation and advances in newborn screening (NBS), the diagnosis of many IEM has become relatively easy utilizing laboratory biomarkers. For the majority of IEM, early diagnosis prevents the onset of severe clinical symptoms, thus reducing morbidity and mortality. However, due to molecular, biochemical, and clinical variability of IEM, not all disorders included in NBS programs will be detected and diagnosed by screening alone. This article provides a general overview and simplified guidelines for the diagnosis of IEM in patients with and without an acute metabolic decompensation, with early or late onset of clinical symptoms. The proper use of routine laboratory results in the initial patient assessment is also discussed, which can help guide efficient ordering of specialized laboratory tests to confirm a potential diagnosis and initiate treatment as soon as possible.Keywords:  Metabolic, inborn, disorder, diagnosis, laboratory",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6331366/
