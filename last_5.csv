However, other than oral health and vision care, neither the statute nor the implementing regulations define the term. This study aimed to determine how state benchmark plans address pediatric coverage in EHB-governed plans. Our review of state benchmark plan summaries for all 50 states and D.C. found that no state specified a distinct “pediatric services” benefit class. Furthermore, although benchmark plans explicitly included multiple pediatric conditions, many state benchmark plans also specifically excluded services for children with special health care needs. These findings suggest important policy directions in preparing for the 2016 plan year.Keywords: Children's Health, Consumer Issues, Health Reform, Children Insurance Coverage",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4587658/,abstract

Adverse events and pregnancy outcomes from January 1, 2011 to June 30, 2013 were evaluated in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. These pregnant females developed lamivudine (LAM)- or telbivudine (LdT)-resistant chronic hepatitis B and received tenofovir (TDF) therapy (300 mg/d), and its curative effect, maternal and perinatal adverse events, fetal growth and development, and neonatal prognosis were evaluated.RESULTS: The median hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level in the pregnant females with LAM or LdT resistance was 5.9 (range, 4.2-7.2) log10 copies/mL before the initiation of TDF. Ten of these females had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The patients were treated with TDF for a median of 24 wk (range, 12-40 wk). Fourteen females (82.4%) had an HBV DNA level of < 500 copies/mL at the time of delivery. This decrease was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Serum ALT levels were normalized in all subjects with an elevated serum ALT level at baseline (P = 0.0003). There were no significant changes in serum creatinine and phosphorus levels during TDF treatment. In addition, no adverse events related to TDF treatment were observed. Seventeen females delivered 17 live infants, and all infants had good Apgar scores. The mean birth weight was 3226.5 ± 331.7 g, and the mean length at birth was 50.4 ± 1.1 cm. The growth and development of the infants was normal at birth, and no infants had birth defects related to TDF treatment.

In most cases, it results from a loss‐of‐function mutation in the gene encoding methyl‐CPG‐binding protein 2 (MECP2). Currently, about 900 unique MECP2 variations (benign and pathogenic) have been identified and it is suspected that the different mutations contribute to different levels of disease severity. For researchers and clinicians, it is important that genotype–phenotype information is available to identify disease‐causing mutations for diagnosis, to aid in clinical management of the disorder, and to provide counseling for parents. In this study, 13 genotype–phenotype databases were surveyed for their general functionality and availability of RTT‐specific MECP2 variation data. For each database, we investigated findability and interoperability alongside practical user functionality, and type and amount of genetic and phenotype data. The main conclusions are that, as well as being challenging to find these databases and specific MECP2 variants held within, interoperability is as yet poorly developed and requires effort to search across databases. Nevertheless, we found several thousand online database entries for MECP2 variations and their associated phenotypes, diagnosis, or predicted variant effects, which is a good starting point for researchers and clinicians who want to provide, annotate, and use the data.Keywords: databases, FAIR data, genetic variation, MECP2, phenotype, Rett syndrome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6033003/,abstract

Aim: To study the impact of CGMP-AA on blood Phe variability using 3 different dietary regimens in children with PKU. Methods: This was a 6-week randomised controlled cross-over study comparing CGMP-AA vs. Phe-free l-amino acids (l-AA) assessing blood Phe and tyrosine (Tyr) variability over 24 h in 19 children (7 boys) with PKU, with a median age of 10 years (6–16). Subjects were randomised to 3 dietary regimens: (1) R1, CGMP-AA and usual dietary Phe (CGMP + Phe); (2) R2, CGMP-AA − Phe content of CGMP-AA from usual diet (CGMP − Phe); and (3) R3, l-AA and usual dietary Phe. Each regimen was administered for 14 days. Over the last 48 h on days 13 and 14, blood spots were collected every 4 h at 08 h, 12 h, 16 h, 20 h, 24 h, and 04 h. Isocaloric intake and the same meal plan and protein substitute dosage at standardised times were maintained when blood spots were collected. Results: Eighteen children completed the study. Median Phe concentrations over 24 h for each group were (range) R1, 290 (30–580), R2, 220 (10–670), R3, 165 (10–640) μmol/L. R1 vs. R2 and R1 vs. R3 p < 0.0001; R2 vs. R3 p = 0.0009. There was a significant difference in median Phe at each time point between R1 vs. R2, p = 0.0027 and R1 vs. R3, p < 0.0001, but not between any time points for R2 vs. R3. Tyr was significantly higher in both R1 and R2 [70 (20–240 μmol/L] compared to R3 [60 (10–200) μmol/L]. In children < 12 years, blood Phe remained in the target range (120–360 μmol/L), over 24 h, for 75% of the time in R1, 72% in R2 and 64% in R3; for children aged ≥ 12 years, blood Phe was in target range (120–600 μmol/L) in R1 and R2 for 100% of the time, but 64% in R3. Conclusions: The residual Phe in CGMP-AA increased blood Phe concentration in children. CGMP-AA appears to give less blood Phe variability compared to l-AA, but this effect may be masked by the increased blood Phe concentrations associated with its Phe contribution. Reducing dietary Phe intake to compensate for CGMP-AA Phe content may help.Keywords: glycomacropeptide, phenylalanine, phenylketonuria, phenylalanine variability, amino acids, tyrosine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6471794/,abstract

In this review, we present animal models, particularly rats and mice, which have been extensively used by scientists to understand the consequences of diet quality on weight gain and health. Notably, modulation of dietary protein quantity and/or quality has been shown to exert huge effects on body composition homeostasis through the modulation of food intake, energy expenditure, and metabolic pathways. Interestingly, the perinatal window appears to represent a critical period during which the protein intake of the dam can impact the offspring’s weight gain and feeding behavior. Animal models are also widely used to understand the processes and mechanisms that contribute to obesity at different physiological and pathophysiological stages. An interesting example of such aspect is the situation of decreased estrogen level occurring at menopause, which is linked to weight gain and decreased energy expenditure. To study metabolic disorders associated with such situation, estrogen withdrawal in ovariectomized animal models to mimic menopause are frequently used. According to many studies, clear species-specific differences exist between rats and mice that need to be taken into account when results are extrapolated to humans.Keywords: animal models, obesity, body composition, dietary protein, food intake, energy expenditure, estrogen deficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357654/,abstract

Dried newborn cord and heel-prick blood spot samples collected as part of a validation study nested within a preterm birth research cohort were collected between January 2017 and July 2018 and analyzed in a Canadian newborn screening laboratory where the laboratory’s disease panel and screening thresholds were applied.ResultsA total of 1661 newborn samples (520 heel-prick and 1141 cord blood samples) were available for analysis. Based on the applied screening thresholds, 61 samples (22 by heel-prick and 39 by cord blood) were screen positive for conditions included in the Canadian disease panel. Congenital hypothyroidism was the most common determination for heel-prick (n = 17) and cord blood (n = 12) samples. Carriers of hemoglobinopathy variants were identified in 6.9% of both tested heel-prick and cord blood samples.ConclusionsThis study provides insight into the nature and frequency of treatable congenital conditions in a rural Bangladesh community where such data were previously unavailable. As comment to the feasibility of newborn screening in the region we confirm that screening based on cord blood sampling continues to be the most acceptable modality to parents in such settings.

For example, V600E in the BRAF hydrophobic activation segment (AS) pocket accounts for >95% of all kinase mutations. While many hypotheses tried to explain such significant mutation patterns, conclusive explanations are lacking. Here, we use experimental and in silico structure-energy statistical analyses, to elucidate why the V600E mutation, but no other mutation at this, or any other positions in BRAF’s hydrophobic pocket, is predominant. We find that BRAF mutation frequencies depend on the equilibrium between the destabilization of the hydrophobic pocket, the overall folding energy, the activation of the kinase and the number of bases required to change the corresponding amino acid. Using a random forest classifier, we quantitatively dissected the parameters contributing to BRAF AS cancer frequencies. These findings can be applied to genome-wide association studies and prediction models.DOI:

Households with children who had never received newborn screening (26%) reported lower frequencies of favorable responses in all categories compared to households that had at least one child screened. The difference in access to newborn screening was less marked between the groups compared to differences on knowledge and consideration of its importance. Moreover, 55% of households who had never screened any of their children reported being unlikely or unsure of screening any future children.

We determine that several other metabolites that accumulate in metabolic disorders form ordered amyloid-like ultrastructures, which induce apoptotic cell death, as observed for amyloid structures. The formation of amyloid-like assemblies by metabolites implies a general phenomenon of amyloid formation, not limited to proteins and peptides, and offers a new paradigm for metabolic diseases.Keywords: Amyloid Formation, self-assembly, Metabolic disorders, molecular recognition, Amyloid hypothesis, Nano-assemblies, nanotechnology, Nanoscience",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4643800/,abstract

It has been suggested that this may alter neurotransmitter metabolism, specifically dopamine and serotonin. Herein mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is used for the direct measurement of 2,4-diphenyl-pyranylium tetrafluoroborate (DPP-TFB) derivatives of monoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of AKU following treatment with nitisinone.MethodsMetabolite changes were assessed using MSI on DPP-TFB derivatised fresh frozen tissue sections directing analysis towards primary amine neurotransmitters. Matched tail bleed plasma samples were analysed using LC-MS/MS. Eighteen BALB/c mice were included in this study: HGD−/− (n = 6, treated with nitisinone – 4 mg/L, in drinking water); HGD−/− (n = 6, no treatment) and HGD+/− (n = 6, no treatment).ResultsIon intensity and distribution of DPP-TFB derivatives in brain tissue for dopamine, 3-methoxytyramine, noradrenaline, tryptophan, serotonin, and glutamate were not significantly different following treatment with nitisinone in HGD−/− mice, and no significant differences were observed between HGD−/− and HGD+/− mice that received no treatment. Tyrosine (10-fold in both comparisons, p = 0.003; [BALB/c HGD−/− (n = 6) and BALB/c HGD+/− (n = 6) (no treatment) vs. BALB/c HGD−/− (n = 6, treated)] and tyramine (25-fold, p = 0.02; 32-fold, p = 0.02) increased significantly following treatment with nitisinone. Plasma tyrosine and homogentisic acid increased (9-fold, p = < 0.0001) and decreased (9-fold, p = 0.004), respectively in HGD−/− mice treated with nitisinone.ConclusionsMonoamine neurotransmitters in brain tissue from a murine model of AKU did not change following treatment with nitisinone.

Over 300 disease-associated GALT mutations have been reported, with the majority being missense changes, although a better understanding of their underlying molecular effects has been hindered by the lack of structural information for the human enzyme. Here, we present the 1.9 Å resolution crystal structure of human GALT (hGALT) ternary complex, revealing a homodimer arrangement that contains a covalent uridylylated intermediate and glucose-1-phosphate in the active site, as well as a structural zinc-binding site, per monomer. hGALT reveals significant structural differences from bacterial GALT homologues in metal ligation and dimer interactions, and therefore is a zbetter model for understanding the molecular consequences of disease mutations. Both uridylylation and zinc binding influence the stability and aggregation tendency of hGALT. This has implications for disease-associated variants where p.Gln188Arg, the most commonly detected, increases the rate of aggregation in the absence of zinc likely due to its reduced ability to form the uridylylated intermediate. As such our structure serves as a template in the future design of pharmacological chaperone therapies and opens new concepts about the roles of metal binding and activity in protein misfolding by disease-associated mutants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5081055/,abstract

Nevertheless, an emerging body of literature, generated by numerous research groups, demonstrates that the immune system can produce antibodies that specifically bind PEG, which can lead to the “accelerated blood clearance” of PEGylated therapeutics. In animals, anti-PEG immunity is typically robust but short-lived and consists of a predominantly anti-PEG IgM response. Rodent studies suggest that the induction of anti-PEG antibodies (α-PEG Abs) primarily occurs through a type 2 T-cell independent mechanism. Although anti-PEG immunity is less well-studied in humans, the presence of α-PEG Abs has been correlated with reduced efficacy of PEGylated therapeutics in clinical trials. The prevalence of anti-PEG IgG and reports of memory immune responses, as well as the existence of α-PEG Abs in healthy untreated individuals, suggests that the mechanism(s) and features of human anti-PEG immune responses may differ from those of animal models. Many questions, including the incidence rate of pre-existing α-PEG Abs and immunological mechanism(s) of α-PEG Ab formation in humans, must be answered in order to fully address the potential complications of anti-PEG immunity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4515207/,abstract

Phe levels can be controlled following a protein-free diet, but cognitive impairments are still present. A number of questions remain to be answered related to which type of metabolic control is important, the age when it is important, the cognitive functions which are most affected and, the best tests to use to monitor cognitive health. Method: We investigated the impact of metabolic control at different ages on cognitive performance in 37 early treated adults with PKU. Results: (a) Phe variation was as associated to performance as average Phe showing that stable dietary control is as important as strict control; (b) For some tasks, current and adult Phe were stronger predictors of performance than childhood or adolescent Phe, showing the importance of a strict diet even in adulthood; and (c) The relationship between performance and Phe levels varied depending on time and cognitive domain. For some functions (sustained attention, visuomotor coordination), Phe at the time of testing was the best predictor. While for other functions (visual attention, executive functions) there was a diminishing or stable relationship across time. Conclusion: Results show the importance of selecting the right tasks to monitor outcomes across ages, but also that the impact of bio-chemical disruptions is different for different functions, at different ages.

Recent capabilities in genome-wide protein binding profiling have stimulated systematic studies of the hierarchical organization of human gene regulatory network and DNA-binding specificity of TFs, shedding light on combinatorial gene regulation. We show here that these data also enable a systematic annotation of the biological functions and functional diversity of TFs.ResultWe compiled a human gene regulatory network for 384 TFs covering the 146,096 TF–target gene (TF–TG) relationships, extracted from over 850 ChIP-seq experiments as well as the literature. By integrating this network of TF–TF and TF–TG relationships with 3715 functional concepts from six sources of gene function annotations, we obtained over 9000 confident functional annotations for 279 TFs. We observe extensive connectivity between TFs and Mendelian diseases, GWAS phenotypes, and pharmacogenetic pathways. Further, we show that TFs link apparently unrelated functions, even when the two functions do not share common genes. Finally, we analyze the pleiotropic functions of TFs and suggest that the increased number of upstream regulators contributes to the functional pleiotropy of TFs.ConclusionOur computational approach is complementary to focused experimental studies on TF functions, and the resulting knowledge can guide experimental design for the discovery of unknown roles of TFs in human disease and drug response.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12915-017-0469-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Transcription factor, Regulatory network, Gene function annotation, Functional pleiotropy, Regulator diversity, Target gene, Database, Function enrichment, Co-regulation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5795274/,abstract

In this paper, we consider the nature of interactions between certain major sociodemographic and behavioral risk factors associated with all-cause mortality in the United States. We develop the formal logic pertaining to two forms of interaction between risk factors, additive and multiplicative relations. We then consider the general circumstances in which additive or multiplicative relations might be expected. We argue that expectations about interactions among socio-demographic variables, and their relation to behavioral variables, have been stated in terms of additivity. However, the statistical models typically used to estimate the relation between risk factors and mortality assume that risk factors act multiplicatively.We examine empirically the nature of interactions among five major risk factors associated with all-cause mortality: smoking, obesity, race, sex, and educational attainment. Data were drawn from the cross-sectional NHANES III (1988–1994) and NHANES 1999–2010 surveys, linked to death records through December 31, 2011. Our analytic sample comprised 35,604 respondents and 5,369 deaths.We find that obesity is additive with each of the remaining four variables. We speculate that its additivity is a reflection of the fact that obese status is generally achieved later in life. For all pairings of socio-demographic variables, risks are multiplicative. For survival chances, it is much more dangerous to be poorly educated if you are black or if you are male. And it is much riskier to be a male if you are black. These traits, established at birth or during childhood, literally result in deadly combinations.We conclude that the identification of interactions among risk factors can cast valuable light on the nature of the process being studied.

NG-2(+) astrocytes had classic features including the presence of glial filaments but low levels of glial filament expression were also found in OPCs and myelinating oligodendrocytes. P0 RONs contained few OPCs but positively identified astrocytes were observed to ensheath pre-myelinated axons in a fashion previously described as a definitive marker of the oligodendrocyte lineage. Astrocyte ensheathment was also apparent in P10 RONs, was absent from developing nodes of Ranvier and was never associated with compact myelin. Astrocyte processes were also shown to encapsulate some oligodendrocyte somata.

Reactive aldehydes have been demonstrated to cause specific genotoxic injury, namely DNA interstrand cross-links. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is a member of a 19 isoenzyme ALDH family with different substrate specificities, subcellular localization, and patterns of expression. ALDH2 is localized in mitochondria and is essential for the metabolism of acetaldehyde, thereby placing it directly downstream of ethanol metabolism. Deficiency in ALDH2 expression and function are caused by a single nucleotide substitution and resulting amino acid change, called ALDH2*2. This genetic polymorphism affects 35–45% of East Asians (about ~560 million people), and causes the well-known Asian flushing syndrome, which results in disulfiram-like reactions after ethanol consumption. Recently, the ALDH2*2 genotype has been found to be associated with marrow failure, with both an increased risk of sporadic aplastic anemia and more rapid progression of Fanconi Anemia.

Perhaps, the most intuitive way to assess the potential pathogenicity of a given human missense variant is by measuring the degree of evolutionary conservation of the substituted amino-acid residue, a feature that generally serves as a good proxy metric for the functional/structural importance of that residue. However, the presence of putatively compensated variants as the wild-type alleles in orthologous proteins of other mammalian species not only challenges this classical view of amino-acid essentiality but also precludes the accurate evaluation of the functional impact of this type of missense variant using currently available bioinformatic prediction tools. Compensated variants constitute at least 4% of all known missense variants causing human-inherited disease and hence represent an important potential source of error in that they are likely to be disproportionately misclassified as benign variants. The consequent under-reporting of compensated variants is exacerbated in the context of next-generation sequencing where their inappropriate exclusion constitutes an unfortunate natural consequence of the filtering and prioritization of the very large number of variants generated.

Research over the past two decades has established firmly the role of genetics in the development of these congenital defects. While syndromic CHDs are more straightforward, non-syndromic CHDs are usually characterized by multiple mutations that affect intricate inter-connected developmental pathways. Knock-out and gene expression studies in mice and other genetic models have been performed to elucidate the roles of these implicated genes. Functional analysis has not been able to resolve the complete picture, as increasingly more downstream effects are continuously being assigned to CHD mutant factors. NKX2-5, a cardiac transcription factor, has received much attention for its role in cardiac dysmorphogenesis. Approximately 50 different mutations in this gene have been identified to date, and only a few have been functionally characterized.

However, despite this effect, neuropsychological outcome in PKU still remains suboptimal and the phenylalanine-restricted diet is very demanding. To improve neuropsychological outcome and relieve the dietary restrictions for PKU patients, supplementation of large neutral amino acids (LNAA) is suggested as alternative treatment strategy that might correct all brain biochemical disturbances caused by high blood phenylalanine, and thereby improve neurocognitive functioning.ObjectiveAs a proof-of-principle, this study aimed to investigate all hypothesized biochemical treatment objectives of LNAA supplementation (normalizing brain phenylalanine, non-phenylalanine LNAA, and monoaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations) in PKU mice.MethodsC57Bl/6 Pah-enu2 (PKU) mice and wild-type mice received a LNAA supplemented diet, an isonitrogenic/isocaloric high-protein control diet, or normal chow. After six weeks of dietary treatment, blood and brain amino acid and monoaminergic neurotransmitter concentrations were assessed.ResultsIn PKU mice, the investigated LNAA supplementation regimen significantly reduced blood and brain phenylalanine concentrations by 33% and 26%, respectively, compared to normal chow (p<0.01), while alleviating brain deficiencies of some but not all supplemented LNAA. Moreover, LNAA supplementation in PKU mice significantly increased brain serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations from 35% to 71% and from 57% to 86% of wild-type concentrations (p<0.01), respectively, but not brain dopamine concentrations (p = 0.307).ConclusionsThis study shows that LNAA supplementation without dietary phenylalanine restriction in PKU mice improves brain biochemistry through all three hypothesized biochemical mechanisms. Thereby, these data provide proof-of-concept for LNAA supplementation as a valuable alternative dietary treatment strategy in PKU. Based on these results, LNAA treatment should be further optimized for clinical application with regard to the composition and dose of the LNAA supplement, taking into account all three working mechanisms of LNAA treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4666635/,abstract

Fourteen survivors of childhood brain tumor aged 7–18 years, who were off-treatment for at least 1 year and were in remission, and 31 unrelated healthy controls were recruited. The median age at diagnosis was 8.20 years (range: 0.92–12.96 years). The diagnoses of brain tumors were medulloblastoma, germ cell tumor, pineocytoma, pilocystic astrocytoma, suprasellar germinoma, and ependymoma. Eleven survivors received central nervous system irradiation. Seven tasks were selected from the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks program to evaluate alertness (processing speed), and major aspects of executive functioning, such as working memory capacity, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and sustained attention. Speed, stability and accuracy of responses were the main outcome measures.Results: Survivors of childhood brain tumor showed statistically significant poorer performance on all tasks compared to healthy controls. Both processing speed and accuracy were impaired in the survivors, in particular under more complex task conditions. The survivors demonstrated deficits in alertness, sustained attention, working memory capacity, executive visuomotor control, and cognitive flexibility. Longer duration off treatment appeared to be correlated with poorer alertness, memory capacity, and inhibition.Conclusion: Survivors of childhood brain tumor in our center showed impaired neuropsychological functioning. Development of less toxic treatment protocols is important to prevent late effects of cognitive deficits in survivors of childhood brain tumor.Keywords: Amsterdam Neuropsychological Task (ANT), children, brain tumor, neuropsychological sequelae, survivors",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5986920/,abstract

Furthermore, numerous studies on BH4-sensitive PAH deficiency have been conducted. To date, BH4, a cofactor of PAH, has not been used to treat PKU in Russia.Genotype data of patients with PKU can be used to predict their sensitivity to BH4 therapy. A cohort of 2579 patients with PKU from Russia was analyzed for 25 common PAH gene mutations using custom allele-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification-based technology. A mutation detection rate of 84.1% chromosomes was accomplished. Both pathogenic alleles were identified in 73.1% of patients. The most frequent pathogenic variants were p.Arg408Trp (50.9%), p.Arg261Gln (5.3%), p.Pro281Leu (3.5%), IVS12+1G>A (3.1%), IVS10-11G>A (2.6%), and p.Arg158Leu (2.4%). The exact boundaries of a PAH exon 5 deletion were defined as EX5del4154ins268 (c.442-2913_509+1173del4154ins268). Severe phenotypes prevailed in the cohort, and classical PKU was observed in 71.8% cases. Due to the genotype-based prediction, 55.9% of the probands were non-responders to the BH4-treatment, and 20.2% were potential responders. Analysis of genotype data is useful to predict BH4 response in PKU patients. The high rate of non-responders among Russian patients was due to the high allele frequency of severe PAH mutations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6342299/,abstract

Two authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. The meta‐analysis was performed in RevMan 5.3 provided by the Cochrane Collaboration.ResultsFour studies met the inclusion criteria. In PKU patients with low blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentration, no significant difference was indicated for the decrease of Phe level (weighted mean difference (WMD) = −7.75 μmol L−1; 95% confidence intervals (CI): −82.63 to 67.13, P = 0.84, I

The use of high-resolution melting (HRM) of DNA provides a fast closed-tube method for analysis of the sequence composition of the mitochondrial genes 12S rRNA and cytochrome b. We investigated the potential use of HRM for species identification within eleven different animal groups commonly found in Europe by animal-group-specific DNA amplification followed by DNA melting. Influence factors as DNA amount, additional single base alterations, and the existence of mixed samples were taken into consideration. Visual inspection combined with mathematical evaluation of the curve shapes did resolve nearly all species within an animal group. The assay can therefore not only be used for identification of animal groups and mixture analysis but also for species identification within the respective groups. The use of a universal 12S rRNA system additionally revealed a possible approach for species discrimination, mostly by exclusion. The use of the HRM assay showed to be a reliable, fast, and cheap method for species discrimination within a broad range of different animal species and can be used in a flexible “modular” manner depending on the question to be solved.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4274031/,abstract

However, few studies have been done to evaluate the affordability of rare disease patients in China. This study aims to provide policy recommendations for the establishment of social security mechanism for rare diseases in China, so as to address the problem of poverty caused by these diseases.MethodsA total of 7 rare diseases were selected by Delphi method. Affordability of treatment for the 7 rare diseases was assessed through annual per capital income, catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment expenditure among urban and rural residents in China.ResultsAssessed through annual per capital income, health expenditure for the 7 rare diseases are all rather high. The highest health expenditure is equivalent to income of 69.34 years of one urban resident, and the burden is heavier for rural residents. Through catastrophic expenditure assessment, proportions of the population experiencing catastrophic expenditure caused by the 7 rare diseases are all under 0.167 ‰. However, once one is ill and taking medications, he will suffer from catastrophic health expenditure. Through impoverishment expenditure assessment, the proportions of impoverishment payment are low among both urban and rural residents, but the 7 rare diseases could lead nearly 4.6 million people into poverty on a national scale.ConclusionThe affordability of treatment for rare disease as well as orphan drugs is rather poor. Residents of different income levels all have difficulties to afford the treatment for rare diseases, so poverty caused by rare diseases is quite widespread. Therefore, social security mechanism for rare disease patients should be established and specific payment pattern for orphan drugs should be set up.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13023-016-0454-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Rare disease, Orphan drug, Catastrophic expenditure, Impoverishment effect, Affordability",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4895890/,abstract

Many studies have documented the outcome of maternal PKU infants, but very little has been reported about the experiences of women of reproductive age with PKU, particularly about their psychosexual development, pre-conception, pregnancy and postnatal experience.MethodsIn the UK, in a subsection of an online questionnaire conducted by the National Society for PKU (NSPKU) about living with PKU, women aged 18 years and over completed 9 closed questions about their pre-conception, pregnancy and post-natal experiences and an open-ended question on their reproductive health.Results300 women aged 18 years and over with PKU completed this questionnaire with 37% (n = 111/300) of women already having children. 56% (n = 71/128) of pregnancies were planned and a further 18% (n = 23/128) of women had both planned and unplanned pregnancies. Most women (73%, n = 200/273) expressed concerns, fears and distress about pregnancy and two thirds of women who had at least one pregnancy stated that having PKU made pregnancy more stressful and difficult. 60% (n = 164/273) were concerned that they may cause harm to a baby, 58% (n = 159/273) worried about their ability to manage a strict diet during pregnancy, 54% (n = 147/273) had anxiety about their ability to maintain blood Phe within target range, and 48% (n = 132/273) feared having an unplanned pregnancy.Postnatally, 48% (n = 45/93) had low mood or sadness, 41% (n = 38/93) were depressed, 34% (n = 32/93) felt unable to cope, 33% (n = 31/93) said they could not manage their PKU and care for their baby, 14% (n = 13/93) struggled with child care needs and 4% (n = 4/94) worried they might hurt themselves or their baby through being unable to manage their diet.ConclusionsMany women with PKU have unmet sexual and reproductive health needs. Pregnancy fears are prominent from adolescence onwards and for some women overarching concerns about their ability to cope with pregnancy led to a decision not to have children. Interventions are needed to reduce the psychological impact of the risk of maternal PKU syndrome and assist with safe pregnancies. Post-natal experiences of women with PKU give rise to concern.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, Phenylalanine, Diet, Survey, Questionnaire, Thematic analysis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6218656/,abstract

The approaches used to establish DRIs on the basis of classical nutrient deficiencies and/or toxicities have worked well. However, it has proved to be more challenging to base DRI values on chronic disease endpoints; deviations from the traditional framework were often required, and in some cases, DRI values were not established for intakes that affected chronic disease outcomes despite evidence that supported a relation. The increasing proportions of elderly citizens, the growing prevalence of chronic diseases, and the persistently high prevalence of overweight and obesity, which predispose to chronic disease, highlight the importance of understanding the impact of nutrition on chronic disease prevention and control. A multidisciplinary working group sponsored by the Canadian and US government DRI steering committees met from November 2014 to April 2016 to identify options for addressing key scientific challenges encountered in the use of chronic disease endpoints to establish reference values. The working group focused on 3 key questions: 1) What are the important evidentiary challenges for selecting and using chronic disease endpoints in future DRI reviews, 2) what intake-response models can future DRI committees consider when using chronic disease endpoints, and 3) what are the arguments for and against continuing to include chronic disease endpoints in future DRI reviews? This report outlines the range of options identified by the working group for answering these key questions, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each option.Keywords: Dietary Reference Intakes, chronic disease, intake response, evidentiary challenges, evidence assessments",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5183726/,abstract
52,10.1007/8904_2014_365,25712380,"Go to:AbstractMaternal phenylketonuria (MPKU) is a well-recognized complication of PKU and one of the most potent teratogenic syndromes of pregnancy. Virtually all offspring from untreated pregnancies in women with classic PKU have intellectual disabilities and microcephaly. Congenital heart disease and intrauterine growth retardation occur many times more often than expected in the general population. Control of maternal blood phenylalanine during pregnancy prevents most if not all of these complications. Previous studies demonstrated the benefits of treatment in terms of birth parameters and early development. In this study, physical examinations, a medical history, and neuropsychological evaluation were obtained in 47 children from 24 mothers with PKU who received treatment during pregnancy. Mothers were interviewed and administered an abbreviated IQ test. Associations between maternal factors and offspring outcomes were also analyzed.The 21 male and 26 female offspring ranged in age from 1 month to 26 years with 21 (62%) over 6 years. Results indicated mean intercanthal distances above the 70th percentile. Microcephaly was present in 19% of offspring, with head circumference below the third percentile. None of the offspring had cardiac anomalies. Mean offspring IQ was 94 ± 19, with 12% performing in the range of intellectual disability (IQ < 70). Among children >5 years of age, 25% had learning disabilities, 31% had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 22% were on ADHD medication, and 34% had a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression. Among the 24 mothers, 12 reported following the diet for PKU. Only one woman on diet had a blood phenylalanine concentration <360 μmol/L (recommended range) and the majority had indications of poor nutritional status. Mean maternal Full Scale IQ was 94 ± 16 (range = 61–117), with 25% performing in the borderline intellectual range (IQ < 85). Verbal IQ was significantly lower than Performance IQ (p = 0.01, CI 2.7, 16.1). On the self-report Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition, 25% received scores indicating mild to moderate depression, and on the Beck Anxiety Inventory, 46% reported mild to moderate anxiety. Offspring IQ correlated with maternal metabolic control during pregnancy (r = 0.51), maternal IQ (r = −0.62), and socioeconomic position (r = −0.48). Offspring with ADHD, learning disabilities, or emotional disturbances were more likely to have mothers with anxiety and/or depression. To ensure optimal offspring outcomes, healthcare providers need to assess maternal nutrition, blood phenylalanine concentrations, cognitive abilities, and socioeconomic position. Interventions can then be initiated that reduce psychosocial stressors and enhance adherence to diet and positive parenting, which in turn can lead to better cognitive functioning, behavior, and emotional well-being in their children.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4470942/,abstract

The role of glutamine in fueling the tricarboxylic acid cycle of leukemia cells was however recently identified confirming its status of major anaplerotic precursor in solid tumors. Here we examined whether glutamine metabolism could represent a therapeutic target in leukemia cells and whether resistance to this strategy could arise. We found that glutamine deprivation inhibited leukemia cell growth but also led to a glucose-independent adaptation maintaining cell survival. A proteomic study revealed that glutamine withdrawal induced the upregulation of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT), two enzymes of the serine pathway. We further documented that both exogenous and endogenous serine were critical for leukemia cell growth and contributed to cell regrowth following glutamine deprivation. Increase in oxidative stress upon inhibition of glutamine metabolism was identified as the trigger of the upregulation of PHGDH. Finally, we showed that PHGDH silencing in vitro and the use of serine-free diet in vivo inhibited leukemia cell growth, an effect further increased when glutamine metabolism was blocked. In conclusion, this study identified serine as a key pro-survival actor that needs to be handled to sensitize leukemia cells to glutamine-targeting modalities.Keywords: glutamine, serine, PHGDH, metabolism, leukemia",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4811496/,abstract

Microsoft Excel 2003 was used for data input, and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16.0 (International Business Machines Corporation, New York, NY, USA) was used for descriptive analysis. χ2 test, Spearman correlation and linear-by-linear association trend test were used for statistical analyses.Results:The birth defect rate declined from 9.18% in 2003 to 7.00% in 2012 (χ2 = 45.001, P < 0.01) with a mean value of 7.85%, which is below the Chinese national average level (χ2 = 20.451, P < 0.01). The order of five most common birth defects has changed. The incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) increased with time, particularly after 2012, it became the most frequent type (rs = 0.808, P < 0.001). Till then, the number of neural tube defects (NTDs) declined significantly (χ2 = 76.254, P < 0.01). The average birth defects rate of 8.11% in rural areas was higher than that in urban areas (7.56%, χ2 = 7.919, P < 0.01) and much higher in males (8.28%) than that in females (7.18%, χ2 = 32.397, P < 0.01). Maternal age older than 35 years (χ2 = 35.298, P < 0.01) is the most dangerous age bracket of birth defects than maternal age younger than 20 years (χ2 = 7.128, P < 0.01).Conclusions:A downward trend of birth defects was observed in Xi’an City from 2003 to 2012.

55,10.1371/journal.pone.0165468,27783658,"Go to:AbstractAvoiding complementarity between primers when designing a PCR assay constitutes a central rule strongly anchored in the mind of the molecular scientist. 3’-complementarity will extend the primers during PCR elongation using one another as template, consequently disabling further possible involvement in traditional target amplification. However, a 5’-complementarity will leave the primers unchanged during PCR cycles, albeit sequestered to one another, therefore also suppressing target amplification. We show that 5’-complementarity between primers may be exploited in a new PCR method called COMplementary-Primer-Asymmetric (COMPAS)-PCR, using asymmetric primer concentrations to achieve target PCR amplification. Moreover, such a design may paradoxically reduce spurious non-target amplification by actively sequestering the limiting primer. The general principles were demonstrated using 5S rDNA direct repeats as target sequences to design a species-specific assay for identifying Salmo salar and Salmo trutta using almost fully complementary primers overlapping the same target sequence. Specificity was enhanced by using 3’-penultimate point mutations and the assay was further developed to enable identification of S. salar x S. trutta hybrids by High Resolution Melt analysis in a 35 min one-tube assay. This small paradigm shift, using highly complementary primers for PCR, should help develop robust assays that previously would not be considered.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082663/,abstract

Here we report initial data on characteristics from patients recruited by the time of the third interim analysis and results at 1 year.Results: Overall, 325 patients from 55 sites in seven European countries were included in the analysis: 296 (91.1%) patients with PAH deficiency (median [Q1, Q3] age, 10.3 [7.2, 15.0] years) and 29 (8.9%) with BH4 deficiency (12.8 [6.6, 18.9] years). Fifty-nine patients (18.2%) were aged ≥18 years; 4 patients were pregnant. No elderly patients (aged ≥65 years) or patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency were enroled in the study. Twelve-month data were available for 164 patients with PAH deficiency and 16 with BH4 deficiency. No new safety concerns were identified as of May 2013.Conclusions: Initial data from KAMPER show that sapropterin dihydrochloride has a favourable safety profile.

These conditions arise due to the abnormal development of an embryo's normal structures.AIMS:A case–control study was conducted to investigate the determinant factors leading to CHD.MATERIALS AND METHODS:All newborns who have been diagnosed with CHD upon echocardiography in 2013 were considered as cases. The number of samples required was randomly selected from the newborns who lacked CHD on cardiography. The mothers of both groups were handed the questionnaires.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED:SPSS 23 was employed to analyze the data.RESULTS:A statistically significant association was seen between CHD and a positive family history (FH) (P < 0.001), consanguinity (P < 0.001), maternal diabetes (P = 0.004), the use of antiepileptics during the first 45 days of gestation (P = 0.002), and the mother's education status (P > 0.001).

However, most existing studies that have tested this hypothesis are seriously flawed due to the use of selective groups and/or cross-sectional designs, which limits the ability to draw firm conclusions. This longitudinal study investigated whether patterns of alcohol use predicted differences in maturation of executive functioning in adolescence. Additionally, gender was tested as a possible moderator.MethodsWe used data from the Tracking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), which comprises a cohort of 2,230 Dutch adolescents. Maturation of executive functioning was measured by assessing the standardized improvement on each of four basic executive functions (i.e., inhibition, working memory, and shift- and sustained attention) between ages 11 and 19. Participants were assigned to one of six (heavy) drinking groups (i.e., non-drinkers, light drinkers, infrequent heavy drinkers, increased heavy drinkers, decreased heavy drinkers, and chronic heavy drinkers). We conducted linear regression analyses, and adjusted for relevant confounders.ResultsThe six drinking groups did not reveal significant differences in maturation between drinking groups. E.g., maturation executive functioning of chronic heavy drinkers in comparison to non-drinkers; inhibition: B = -0.14, 95% CI [-0.41 to 0.14], working memory: B = -0.03, 95% CI [-0.26 to 0.21], shift attention: B = 0.13, 95% CI [-0.17 to 0.41], sustained attention: B = 0.12, 95% CI [-0.60 to 0.36].

Our study examined associations between maternal experiences of expanded NBS and subsequent psychosocial functioning and parenting stress in mothers whose infants received either true negative (TN), true positive (TP) or false positive (FP) results after a 4- to 6-month period. The Parenting Stress Index and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale were used to assess symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression in 3 sets of mothers, whose infants received TN (n = 31), TP (n = 8) or FP (n = 18) results. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) results revealed no significant differences among these three groups of mothers regarding overall anxiety, stress and depression. However, FP mothers experienced lower levels of stress related to their own health compared to TN group. Two potential trends were also identified; results suggested TN mothers might experience higher levels of isolation than mothers in the TP group and that FP mothers might report higher stress levels in relation to spousal relationships compared to the TN group.

Growth parameters were within normal range at all ages in both groups with no significant difference in mean z-scores except for accelerated length in the PKU group. No child with PKU had z-scores < −2 for any growth parameter at age 2 years. Total protein and energy intake in both groups were similar at all ages; however, from 12–24 months in the PKU group, the percentage of energy intake from carbohydrate increased (60%) but from fat decreased (25%) and inversely for controls (48% and 36%). In PKU, use of low volume WPS meets Phe-free protein requirements, facilitates transition to solid foods and supports normal growth.

61,10.1038/ncomms11457,27126896,"Go to:AbstractCellular amino acid uptake is critical for mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation and cell proliferation. However, the regulation of amino acid uptake is not well-understood. Here we describe a role for asparagine as an amino acid exchange factor: intracellular asparagine exchanges with extracellular amino acids. Through asparagine synthetase knockdown and altering of media asparagine concentrations, we show that intracellular asparagine levels regulate uptake of amino acids, especially serine, arginine and histidine. Through its exchange factor role, asparagine regulates mTORC1 activity and protein synthesis.

However, understanding the robustness of different analytes in DBS samples is essential, especially in older samples collected for longitudinal studies. Here we analyzed the stability of polar metabolites and lipids in DBS samples collected in 2000-2001 and stored at room temperature. The identified and statistically significant molecules were then compared to matched serum samples stored at −80°C to determine if the DBS samples could be effectively used in a longitudinal study following metabolic disease. Four hundred polar metabolites and lipids were identified in the serum and DBS samples using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS) and LC-ion mobility spectrometry-MS (LC-IMS-MS). The identified polar metabolites overlapped well between the sample types, though only one statistically significant metabolite was conserved in a case-control study of older diabetic males with high body mass indices, triacylglycerides and glucose levels, and low amounts of high density lipoproteins and non-diabetic patients with normal levels, indicating that degradation in the DBS samples affects quantitation. Differences in the lipid identifications indicated that some oxidation occurs in the DBS samples. However, thirty-six statistically significant lipids correlated in both sample types indicating that the lipids did not degrade as much as the polar metabolites in the DBS samples and quantitation was still possible.Keywords: Lipidomics, Metabolomics, Ion Mobility Spectrometry, Mass Spectrometry",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5292309/,abstract

Patients affected by PKU require frequent measurements of phenylalanine (Phe) level in blood plasma. Such a determination is important not only in early diagnostic, but also in monitoring the treatment of PKU to maintain phenylalaninemia within limits that will not affect the brain. A simple, highly sensitive, accurate and rather inexpensive procedure for the simultaneous determination of Phe and Tyr plasma concentrations was previously described in this journal. The new procedure may be applied in many clinical laboratories, including those with no previous experience in diagnosis of inherited amino acid metabolic disorders. In this way the major public health problems linked to PKU not being detected in the first weeks of life (including the burden of institutionalized children with preventable mental retardation) may be avoided.Keywords: phenylalanine, tyrosine, phenylketonuria, newborn screening, public health",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535273/,abstract

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the microstructural integrity of WM pathways across the whole brain in a cohort of paediatric ETPKU patients compared with healthy controls (HCs), by collecting DTI-MRI (diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging) data and diffusion values (mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and fractional anisotropy (FA)).MethodsDTI-MRI data and diffusion values (MD, RD, FA) from WM tracts across the whole brain were analized using Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), in 15 paediatrics TPKU patients (median age: 12 years) and compared with 11 HCs. Areas showing abnormal values in the patient group were correlated (Pearson) with age, lifetime Phe values, last year median and mean Phe, concurrent Phe values in plasma, urine neurotransmitters status biomarkers, and with a processing speed task.ResultsETPKU showed bilaterally decreased MD values compared with HCs in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, corona radiata and in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. RD values followed a similar pattern, although decreased RD values in PKU patients were also found in the anterior limb of the internal capsule and in the cerebral peduncle. Decreased MD and RD values within the aforementioned regions had significant negative correlations with age, last year median and mean Phe and concurrent Phe values. No correlations were found with monoamines in urine or processing speed task.ConclusionsETPKU patients showed MD and RD values significantly decreased across the whole brain when compared with HCs, and this damage was associated with high Phe values and the age of patients. Despite this microstructural damage, no affectation in processing speed was observed in patients with good metabolic control. DTI-MRI sequences could be used as a technique to quantify WM damage that is difficult to be detect in T1 or T2-weighted images, but also to quantify damage of WM through the follow up of patients with poor metabolic control in prospective studies.Keywords: Neuroimaging, Phenylketonuria, Paediatric, Early treatment, Diffusion tensor imaging, Urine monoamines",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6203973/,abstract

Here we re-emphasize the old standpoint that the genotype–phenotype (GP) relationship is best viewed as a connection between two differences, one at the genetic level and one at the phenotypic level. As of today, predominant thinking in biology research is that multiple genes interact with multiple environmental variables (such as abiotic factors, culture, or symbionts) to produce the phenotype. Often, the problem of linking genotypes and phenotypes is framed in terms of genotype and phenotype maps, and such graphical representations implicitly bring us away from the differential view of GP relationships. Here we show that the differential view of GP relationships is a useful explanatory framework in the context of pervasive pleiotropy, epistasis, and environmental effects. In such cases, it is relevant to view GP relationships as differences embedded into differences.

Hcys alteration may be related to the methylation of arginine to asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), which both modify nitric oxide production. The aim of this work is to evaluate the status of Hcys formation methylation cycle and ADMA and SDMA levels in patients with PKU in order to establish a potential relationship.Forty-two early diagnosed PKU patients under dietary treatment and good adherence to their diets were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Their nutritional and biochemical profile, as well as Hcys synthesis status, ADMA and SDMA levels were analyzed and compared with a control group of 40 healthy volunteers. ADMA and SDMA were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography system coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.In this study, 23 classic PKU, 16 moderate PKU, and 3 mild HPA were enrolled. The median age was 10 years old. Median ADMA, SDMA, and Hcys concentration levels (5.1 μM [2.3–25.7], 0.35 μM [0.18–0.57], 0.43 μM [0.26–0.61], respectively) were lower in patients with PKU (P < .001 for ADMA and SDMA) whereas vitamin B12 and folate levels (616 pg/mL [218–1943] and 21 ng/mL [5–51], respectively) were higher comparing with controls. Statistically significant correlations were found between ADMA, and Phe (r = −0.504, P = .001) and Hcys (r = −0.458, P = .037) levels. Several nutrition biomarkers, such as prealbumin, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, selenium, and zinc, were below the normal range.Our study suggests that patients with PKU suffer from poor methylation capacity. Restriction of natural proteins in addition to high intake of vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation in the dietary products, produce an impairment of methylation cycle that leads to low Hcys and ADMA levels. As a result, methylated compounds compete for methyl groups, and there is an impairment of methylation cycle due to low Hcys levels, which is related to the lack of protein quality, despite of elevated concentrations of cofactors.Keywords: asymmetric dimethylarginine, creatine, homocysteine, methylation cycle, phenylketonuria",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5502164/,abstract

Familial hypercholesterolaemia is relatively common, but is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Cardiologists are likely to encounter many individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia; however, patients presenting with premature ASCVD are rarely screened for familial hypercholesterolaemia and fasting lipid levels are infrequently documented. Given that individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia and ASCVD are at a particularly high risk of subsequent cardiac events, this is a missed opportunity for preventive therapy. Furthermore, because there is a 50% chance that first-degree relatives of individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia will also be affected by the disorder, the underdiagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia among patients with ASCVD is a barrier to cascade screening and the prevention of ASCVD in affected relatives. Targeted screening of patients with ASCVD is an effective strategy to identify new familial hypercholesterolaemia index cases. Statins are the standard treatment for individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia; however, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not achieved in a large proportion of patients despite treatment. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have been shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels considerably in individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia who are concurrently receiving the maximal tolerated statin dose. The clinical benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors must, however, also be considered in terms of their cost-effectiveness.

Age of presentation can vary from infancy to adolescence with the more severe forms appearing in early childhood accompanied by significant morbidity and mortality. The understanding of these complex disorders requires special in-depth training, American Board of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ABMGG) certification and experience.

The broad metabolic perturbation was accompanied by behavioral deficits and neuronal loss across the ipsilateral hemisphere containing the injury epicenter. In order to obtain a consolidated biochemical profile of the TBI assessment, a subgrouping of the 190 identified brain metabolites was performed. Metabolites were divided into seven major subgroups: oxidative energy/mitochondrial, glycolysis/pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid, amino acid, neurotransmitters/neuromodulators, one-carbon/folate and other metabolites.

Overall effect sizes were: TBMD −0.45 (95% CI −0.61, −0.28); LBMD −0.70 (95% CI −0.82, −0.57); FBMD −0.96 (95% CI −1.42, −0.49). Definitions of osteopenia and osteoporosis were highly heterogeneous between studies and did not align with World Health Organization standards and the International Society for Clinical Densitometry positions on BMD measurement. Despite individual study findings of low BMD indicating higher risk of osteoporosis, pooled available data suggest reduction in BMD is not clinically important when using standard definitions of low BMD. Results from studies evaluating BTM are inconclusive. Phenylalanine concentration, vitamin D, PTH, and nutrient intake do not correlate with BMD or BTM. We recommend forthcoming studies use standard definitions of low BMD to determine clinical implications of BMD Z-scores below 0, explore cause of low BMD in the subset of patients with low BMD for chronological age (Z-score < −2) and assess fracture risk in patients with PKU.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13023-015-0232-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, PKU, Bone mineral density, BMD, Bone turnover markers, Phenylalanine, Osteopenia, Osteoporosis, Meta-analysis, Systematic review",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4340652/,abstract

Efforts to date have incorporated a variety of tools and techniques, including Web-based portals, short message service (SMS) text messaging, remote collection of biometric data, electronic coaching, electronic-based health education, secure email communication between visits, and electronic collection of lifestyle and quality-of-life surveys. Each of these tools, used alone or in combination, have demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness. Some of the more promising results have been demonstrated using regular collection of biometric devices, SMS text messaging, secure email communication with clinical teams, and regular reporting of quality-of-life variables. In this study, we seek to incorporate several of the most promising mHealth capabilities in a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) workflow.ObjectiveWe aim to address underlying technology needs and gaps related to the use of mHealth technology and the activation of patients living with type 2 diabetes. Stated differently, we enable supporting technologies while seeking to influence patient activation and self-care activities.MethodsThis is a multisite phased study, conducted within the US Military Health System, that includes a user-centered design phase and a PCMH-based feasibility trial. In phase 1, we will assess both patient and provider preferences regarding the enhancement of the enabling technology capabilities for type 2 diabetes chronic care management. Phase 2 research will be a single-blinded 12-month feasibility study that incorporates randomization principles. Phase 2 research will seek to improve patient activation and self-care activities through the use of the Mobile Health Care Environment with tailored behavioral messaging. The primary outcome measure is the Patient Activation Measure scores. Secondary outcome measures are Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities Measure scores, clinical measures, comorbid conditions, health services resource consumption, and technology system usage statistics.ResultsWe have completed phase 1 data collection. Formal analysis of phase 1 data has not been completed. We have obtained institutional review board approval and began phase 1 research in late fall 2016.ConclusionsThe study hypotheses suggest that patients can, and will, improve their activation in chronic care management. Improved activation should translate into improved diabetes self-care. Expected benefits of this research to the scientific community and health care services include improved understanding of how to leverage mHealth technology to activate patients living with type 2 diabetes in self-management behaviors. The research will shed light on implementation strategies in integrating mHealth into the clinical workflow of the PCMH setting.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov {""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT02949037"",""term_id"":""NCT02949037""}}NCT02949037. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/{""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT02949037"",""term_id"":""NCT02949037""}}NCT02949037.

Smoking has complex interactions with monoamine metabolism through the ability of cigarette smoke to suppress Type 1 T helper cell (Th1) type immunity, the immunophenotype that is implicated in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) dysfunction and tryptophan (Trp) breakdown to kynurenine (Kyn) via indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Nicotine also induces tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression, leading to increased synthesis of catecholamines. Furthermore, there is evidence for PAH dysfunction in schizophrenia. This study aimed to compare the plasma levels of selected monoamine precursors and their metabolites in smokers vs. non-smokers in a large sample of patients with schizophrenia. We measured plasma phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr), Trp, and Kyn levels using high-performance liquid chromatography and calculated Phe:Tyr and Kyn:Trp ratios in 920 patients with schizophrenia. Analysis of variance and linear regression analyses were used to compare these endpoints between three groups of patients with schizophrenia: (1) current smokers, (2) past smokers, and (3) non-smokers. There were significant differences among the three groups with regards to Tyr levels [F(2,789) = 3.77, p = 0.02], with current smokers having lower Tyr levels when compared with non-smokers (p = 0.02). Kyn levels and Kyn:Trp ratio were different among the three groups [F(2,738) = 3.17, p = 0.04, F(2,738) = 3.61, p = 0.03] with current smokers having lower Kyn levels (p = 0.04) and higher Kyn:Trp ratio (p = 0.02) when compared with past smokers. These findings need to be replicated with protocols that include healthy controls to further elucidate the neurobiological underpinnings of altered Tyr and Kyn levels in smokers.

As a result, budget impact of orphan drugs is growing. This factor, along with the cost-effectiveness of orphan drugs, is often considered in the reimbursement decisions, directly affecting accessibility of rare disease therapies. The current study aims to assess the budget impact of orphan drugs in Latvia.MethodsOur study covered a 5-year period, from 2010 to 2014. Impact of orphan drugs on Latvian budget was estimated from the National Health Service’s perspective. It was calculated in absolute values and relative to total pharmaceutical market and total drug reimbursement budget. A literature review was performed for comparison with other European countries.ResultsOrphan drug annual expenditure ranged between EUR 2.065 and 3.065 million, with total 5-year expenditure EUR 12.467 million. It constituted, on average, 0.84 % of total pharmaceutical market and 2.14 % of total drug reimbursement budget, respectively. Average annual per patient expenditures varied widely, from EUR 1 534 to EUR 580 952. The most costly treatment was enzyme replacement therapy (Elaprase) for MPS II. Glivec had the highest share (34 %) of the total orphan drug expenditure. Oncological drugs represented more than a half of the total orphan drug expenditure, followed by drugs for metabolic and endocrine conditions and medicines for cardiopulmonary diseases. Three indications: Ph+ CML, MPS II, and PAH accounted for nearly 90 % of the total orphan drug expenditure.ConclusionsBudget impact of orphan drugs in Latvia is very small. It increased slightly over a period of five years, due to the slight increase in the number of patients and the number of orphan drugs reimbursed.

Background: Treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 with nitisinone and phenylalanine and tyrosine restricted diet has largely improved outcome, but the best blood sampling time for assessment of metabolic control is not known.
Aim: To study diurnal and day-to-day variation of phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations in tyrosinemia type 1 patients.
Methods: Eighteen tyrosinemia type 1 patients aged >1 year (median age 7.9 years; range 1.6–20.7) were studied. Capillary blood samples were collected 4 times a day (T1: pre-breakfast, T2: pre-midday meal, T3: before evening meal, and T4: bedtime) for 3 days. Linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate diurnal and day-to-day variation of both phenylalanine and tyrosine.
Results: The coefficients of variation of phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations were the lowest on T1 (13.8% and 14.1%, respectively). Tyrosine concentrations did not significantly differ between the different time points, but phenylalanine concentrations were significantly lower at T2 and T3 compared to T1 (50.1 μmol/L, 29.8 μmol/L, and 37.3 μmol/L, respectively).
Conclusion: Our results indicated that for prevention of too low phenylalanine and too high tyrosine concentrations, measurement of phenylalanine and tyrosine pre-midday meal would be best, since phenylalanine concentrations are the lowest on that time point. Our results also indicated that whilst blood tyrosine concentrations were stable over 24 h, phenylalanine fluctuated. Day-to-day variation was most stable after an overnight fast for both phenylalanine and tyrosine. Therefore, in tyrosinemia type 1 patients the most reliable time point for measuring phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations to enable interpretation of metabolic control is pre-breakfast.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5680281/,abstract

This creates major methodological challenges for studying the development of inhibitory control in childhood including construct validity, developmental appropriateness and sensitivity of measures, and longitudinal factorial invariance. We meta-analyzed 198 studies using measures of inhibitory control, a key aspect of self-regulation, to estimate age ranges of usefulness for each measure. The inhibitory control measures showed limited age ranges of usefulness owing to ceiling/floor effects. Tasks were useful, on average, for a developmental span of less than 3 years. This suggests that measuring inhibitory control over longer spans of development may require use of different measures at different time points, seeking to measure heterotypic continuity. We suggest ways to study the development of inhibitory control, with overlapping measurement in a structural equation modeling framework and tests of longitudinal factorial or measurement invariance. However, as valuable as this would be for the area, we also point out that establishing longitudinal factorial invariance is neither sufficient nor necessary for examining developmental change. Any study of developmental change should be guided by theory and construct validity, aiming toward a better empirical and theoretical approach to the selection and combination of measures.Keywords: Inhibitory control, Self-regulation, Executive function, Meta-analysis, Changing measures, Longitudinal factorial invariance",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4917209/,abstract

She has a history of partial bicornuate uterus and had a previous miscarriage in the first trimester. Pre-conception, her median blood PHE was 462 μmol/L but throughout pregnancy the median reduced to 258 μmol/L. GMP provided 30 g/day protein equivalent (46 mg/day PHE). Total protein equivalent from PS increased from 58 to 86 g/day during pregnancy but AA provided all additional protein equivalent intake. Both GMP and AA were well tolerated with no morning sickness. Normal morphologic evaluation and adequate fetal growth with cephalic biometry near the 5th percentile was determined. The infant was born at 39.3 weeks: weight 2570 g (3rd percentile), length 47.5 cm (10th percentile) and head circumference (HC) of 31.5 cm (1st percentile). In the neonatal period, the infant had craniofacial dimorphism with metopic suture prominence. Father also had bitemporal narrowing. By 12 months of age, the infant's weight (15th percentile), length (50th percentile) and HC (10th–50th percentile) were normal although bitemporal narrowing persisted.ConclusionsThis is the first case reporting the use of GMP in MPKU. Its PHE content did not adversely affect metabolic control although it only provided part of the PS intake. Some intrauterine development delay occurred in the last trimester, although we consider that this is unlikely to be associated with MPKU syndrome or the use of GMP. More published data is essential to examine the impact of using GMP in MPKU on morning sickness severity and aversion, maternal weight gain, blood amino acid concentrations and variability of blood PHE concentrations.Keywords: Maternal phenylketonuria, Glycomacropeptide, l-Amino acids, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5650649/,abstract

Height adjustment (a known, strong correlate of FEV1 and FVC) revealed strong positive height associations of the Z allele (1.50 cm increase in height (p=3.6×10−10)).ConclusionsThe PI-MZ rare (2%) SNP effect is nearly four times greater than the ‘top’ common height SNP in HMGA2. However, height only partially attenuates the SERPINA1-FEV1 or FVC association (around 50%) and vice versa. Height SNP variants have recently been shown to be positively selected collectively in North versus South Europeans, while the Z allele high frequency is localised to North Europe. Although PI-ZZ is clinically disadvantageous to lung function, PI-MZ increases both height and respiratory function; potentially a balanced polymorphism. Partial blockade of PI could conceivably form part of a future poly-therapeutic approach in very short children. The notion that elastase inhibition should benefit patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may also merit re-evaluation.

We are the first to evaluate serum expression of ENA-78 and its relation to antineuronal auto-antibodies in autistic children.MethodsSerum ENA-78 and antineuronal auto-antibodies were measured by ELISA test in 62 autistic children aged between 4–11 years and 62 health-matched controls.ResultsSerum levels of ENA-78 were significantly higher in autistic children than healthy controls (P < 0.001). Increased serum levels of ENA-78 have been found in 69.35% of autistic patients. In addition, autistic children had significantly higher percent positivity of serum antineuronal auto-antibodies (64.5%) than healthy controls (6.45%), P < 0.001.

Unfortunately, the majority of past studies examining this association have used correlational analyses, not allowing for these hypotheses to be tested sufficiently. This correlational issue is especially relevant for the information degradation hypothesis, which states that degraded perceptual signal inputs, resulting from either age-related neurobiological processes (e.g., retinal degeneration) or experimental manipulations (e.g., reduced visual contrast), lead to errors in perceptual processing, which in turn may affect non-perceptual, higher-order cognitive processes. Even though the majority of studies examining the relation between age-related cognitive and perceptual decline have been correlational, we reviewed several studies demonstrating that visual manipulations affect both younger and older adults’ cognitive performance, supporting the information degradation hypothesis and contradicting implications of other hypotheses (e.g., common-cause, sensory deprivation, cognitive load on perception).

abnormalities and disease. This survey proposes that “environmental”
forces associated with diastolic RV/LV rotatory flows exert important, albeit still
unappreciated, epigenetic actions influencing functional and morphological cardiac
adaptations. Mechanisms analogous to Murray's law of hydrodynamic shear-induced
endothelial cell modulation of vascular geometry are likely to link diastolic
vortex-associated shear, torque and “squeeze” forces to RV/LV adaptations.
The time has come to explore a new paradigm in which such forces play a fundamental
epigenetic role, and to work out how heart cells react to them. Findings are considered
from various disciplines, imaging modalities, computational fluid dynamics, molecular cell
biology and cytomechanics. Examined are, among others, structural dynamics of myocardial
cells (endocardium, cardiomyocytes, and fibroblasts), cytoskeleton, nucleoskeleton, and
extracellular matrix, mechanotransduction and signaling, and mechanical epigenetic
influences on genetic expression. To help integrate and focus relevant pluridisciplinary
research, rotatory RV/LV filling flow is placed within a working context that has a

Dental treatments require a good level of communication with the patient. Therefore, in these patients, sedation and general anesthesia are an extremely humanistic approach for comfortable and successful treatment. In patients with special needs, there is no standard anesthetic approach due to varying clinical conditions. The aim of this study was to provide literature content about the anesthetic approaches used by us in patients with special needs.MethodsThe medical records of 710 patients with special health care needs treated under general anesthesia or sedation were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic data, the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, Mallampati score, anesthesia duration, anesthesia type, anesthetic and analgesic agents used, dental treatment performed, secondary diseases, and complications in the perioperative period were recorded. Patients were evaluated under five groups: Down syndrome, other syndromes, psychiatric disorders, physical disabilities, and complicated medical story.ResultsAmong the patients evaluated, 47.5% were females and 52.5% were males (mean age 15.76 ± 11.17 years), and general anesthesia and sedation were administered in 72.9% and 22.1% patients, respectively. The mean duration of anesthesia was 43.20 ± 35.85 min. Simple dental treatments were performed in all groups, and the most common complications were observed in the other syndromes group.ConclusionComplications can be reduced by utilizing the appropriate anesthetic approach and taking serious precautions in patients with special needs.Keywords: Anesthesia, Dental Care, General Anesthesia",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6726890/,abstract

Each sample was analyzed using both a commercial amino acid LC-MS/MS assay and a non-targeted metabolomics assay also based on MS/MS ion transitions. The results of both assays were independently statistically analyzed to identify amino acids associated with estimated glomerular filtration rates using correlation and partial least squares- discriminant analysis.Results:Although there was overlap between the results of the targeted and non-targeted metabolomics assays (tryptophan, 1-methyl histidine), there were also substantial inconsistencies, with the non-targeted assay resulting in more “hits” than the targeted assay. Without further verification of the hits detected by the non-targeted discovery assay, this would have led to different interpretation of the results. There were also false negative results when the non-targeted assay was used (hydroxy proline). Several of said discrepancies could be explained by loss of sensitivity during analytical runs for selected amino acids (serine and threonine), retention time shifts, signals above the range of linear detector response and integration of peaks not separated from background and interferences (aspartate) when the non-targeted metabolomics assay was used.Conclusions:Whenever assessment of a specific pathway such as amino acids is the focus of interest, a targeted seems preferable to a non-targeted metabolomics assay.Keywords: amino acids, non-targeted metabolomics, targeted metabolomics, kidney transplantation, eGFR, multi-analyte LC-MS/MS, LC-MS/MS",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6047903/,abstract

Improvements in care have enabled those affected to experience an improved quality of life, with many affected persons now reaching reproductive age. However, pregnancy poses significant risks for women with the disease and this may affect their reproductive decisions. We conducted an integrative review of the published relevant scientific evidence to ascertain the factors that may influence these women with their reproductive decisions. The electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsychInfo and relevant journals were searched for peer-reviewed papers published between 2005 and 2015. Of the 440 papers identified, six papers satisfied the inclusion criteria and were assessed for quality. Results were analysed and synthesised using a thematic approach to produce a narrative report of the findings. Two main themes were identified: (1) factors influencing reproductive decision-making and (2) experiences during pregnancy. Education regarding disease knowledge and genetic implications may improve participation into screening programmes, facilitate the effective treatment needed to create trust in healthcare services, and promote better self-management. Educating professionals involved in family planning will facilitate women with this condition to make informed decisions regarding pregnancy.

To date, genomic medicine has achieved its greatest successes through applications to diseases that have a high genotype–phenotype correlation and high penetrance, with a near certainty that the individual will develop the condition in the presence of the genotype. It has been anticipated that genomics will play an important role in promoting population health by targeting at-risk individuals and reducing the incidence of highly prevalent, costly, complex diseases, with potential applications across screening, prevention, and treatment decisions. However, where primary or secondary prevention requires behavioural changes, there is currently very little evidence to support reduction in disease incidence. A better understanding of the relationship between genomic variation and complex diseases will be necessary before effective genomic risk identification and management of the risk of complex diseases in healthy individuals can be carried out in clinical practice. Our recommended approach is that priority for genomic testing should focus on diseases where there is strong genotype–phenotype correlation, high or certain penetrance, the effects of the disease are serious and near-term, there is the potential for prevention and/or treatment, and the net costs incurred are acceptable for the health gains achieved.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5698310/,abstract

By placing a strong positive charge on a 1000 kDa ultrafiltration membrane and adjusting the pH of whey close to the isoelectric point of GMP, a 14-fold increase in selectivity was observed compared to unmodified membranes. A one stage membrane system gave 90% pure GMP and a three-stage rectification system gave 97% pure GMP. The charged membrane was salt-tolerant up to 40 mS cm−1 conductivity, allowing fractionation of GMP directly from cheese whey without first lowering the whey conductivity by water dilution. Thus, similarly sized proteins that differed somewhat in isoelectric points and were 50–100 fold smaller than the membrane molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), were cleanly fractionated using charged ultrafiltration membranes without water addition.

Because PTCs are frequently involved in lysosomal diseases, readthrough compounds may be useful as potential therapeutic agents. The aim of our study was to identify patients responsive to gentamicin treatment in order to be used as positive controls to further screen for other PTC readthrough compounds. With this aim, fibroblasts from 11 patients affected by 6 different lysosomal diseases carrying PTCs were treated with gentamicin. Treatment response was evaluated by measuring enzymatic activity, abnormal metabolite accumulation, mRNA expression, protein localization, and cell viability. The potential effect of readthrough was also analyzed by in silico predictions. Results showed that fibroblasts from 5/11 patients exhibited an up to 3-fold increase of enzymatic activity after gentamicin treatment. Accordingly, cell lines tested showed enhanced well-localized protein and/or increased mRNA expression levels and/or reduced metabolite accumulation. Interestingly, these cell lines also showed increased enzymatic activity after PTC124 treatment, which is a PTC readthrough-promoting compound. In conclusion, our results provide a proof-of-concept that PTCs can be effectively suppressed by readthrough drugs, with different efficiencies depending on the genetic context.

Due to many obstacles, PAH enzyme replacement therapy is not currently an option. Treatment of PKU with an alternative enzyme, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), was first proposed in the 1970s. However, issues regarding immunogenicity, enzyme production and mode of delivery needed to be overcome. Through the evaluation of PAL enzymes from multiple species, three potential PAL enzymes from yeast and cyanobacteria were chosen for evaluation of their therapeutic potential. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW = 20,000), at a particular ratio to modify the protein surface, attenuated immunogenicity in an animal model of PKU. All three PEGylated PAL candidates showed efficacy in a mouse model of PKU (BTBR Pahenu2) upon subcutaneous injection. However, only PEGylated Anabaena variabilis (Av) PAL-treated mice demonstrated sustained low Phe levels with weekly injection and was the only PAL evaluated that maintained full enzymatic activity upon PEGylation. A PEGylated recombinant double mutant version of AvPAL (Cys503Ser/Cys565Ser), rAvPAL-PEG, was selected for drug development based on its positive pharmacodynamic profile and favorable expression titers. PEGylation was shown to be critical for rAvPAL-PEG efficacy as under PEGylated rAvPAL had a lower pharmacodynamic effect. rAvPAL and rAvPAL-PEG had poor stability at 4°C.

In nature, l-PAPA occurs as an intermediate of the chloramphenicol biosynthesis pathway in Streptomyces venezuelae. Here we demonstrate that the model organism Escherichia coli can be transformed with metabolic grafting approaches to result in an improved l-PAPA producing strain.ResultsEscherichia coli K-12 cells were genetically engineered for the production of l-PAPA from glycerol as main carbon source. To do so, genes for a 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase (pabAB from Corynebacterium glutamicum), and genes encoding a 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate mutase and a 4-amino-4-deoxyprephenate dehydrogenase (papB and papC, both from Streptomyces venezuelae) were cloned and expressed in E. coli W3110 (lab strain LJ110). In shake flask cultures with minimal medium this led to the formation of ca. 43 ± 2 mg l−1 of l-PAPA from 5 g l−1 glycerol. By expression of additional chromosomal copies of the tktA and glpX genes, and of plasmid-borne aroFBL genes in a tyrR deletion strain, an improved l-PAPA producer was obtained which gave a titer of 5.47 ± 0.4 g l−1
l-PAPA from 33.3 g l−1 glycerol (0.16 g l-PAPA/g of glycerol) in fed-batch cultivation (shake flasks). Finally, in a fed-batch fermenter cultivation, a titer of 16.7 g l−1
l-PAPA was obtained which is the highest so far reported value for this non-proteinogenic amino acid.ConclusionHere we show that E. coli is a suitable chassis strain for l-PAPA production.

Height of healthy siblings (n = 44) and target height, calculated based on parents’ height, served as controls.No statistically significant differences were found comparing mean height z-scores between patients and siblings (p = 0.261).

Despite the fact that effective, curative treatments are available with optimal clinical outcomes when diagnosed early, newborn screening does not exist for the majority of these diseases due to the lack of detectable, specific biomarkers or validated methods for population-based screening. Peptide immunoaffinity enrichment coupled with selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (immuno-SRM) is a sensitive proteomic assay, involving antibody-mediated peptide capture, that allows for concurrent quantification of multiple analytes. This assay has promise for use in potential newborn screening of PIDDs that lead to diminished or absent target proteins in the majority of cases.Objective: To determine and evaluate if a multiplex assay based on immuno-SRM is able to reliably and precisely distinguish affected patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), and CD3ϵ-associated severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) from one another and from unaffected normal control dried blood spot (DBS) samples.Methods: We performed a blinded, multiplexed analysis of proteolytically-generated peptides from WASp, BTK, and CD3ϵ (for WAS, XLA, and SCID, respectively) in DBS samples from 42 PIDD patients, 40 normal adult controls, and 62 normal newborns. The peptide ATPase copper transporting protein (ATP7B) 1056 was simultaneously monitored for quality assurance purposes.Results: The immuno-SRM assays reliably quantified the target peptides in DBS and accurately distinguished affected patients from normal controls. Analysis of signature peptides found statistically significant reduction or absence of peptide levels in affected patients compared to control groups in each case (WASp and BTK: p = 0.0001, SCID: p = 0.05). Intra and inter-assay precision ranged from 11 to 22% and 11 to 43% respectively; linearity (1.39–2000 fmol peptide), and stability (≤ 0.09% difference in 72 h) showed high precision for the multiplexed assay. Inter-laboratory assay comparison showed high concordance for measured peptide concentrations, with R2 linearity ≥ 0.97 for the WASp 274, CD3ϵ 197, BTK 407, and ATP7B 1056 peptides.Conclusion: Immuno-SRM-based quantification of proteotypic peptides from WASp, BTK, and CD3ϵ in DBS distinguishes relevant PIDD cases from one another and from controls, raising the possibility of employing this approach for large-scale multiplexed newborn screening of selective PIDDs.Keywords: peptide immunoaffinity enrichment coupled to SRM (immuno-SRM), Stable Isotope Standards and Capture by Anti-Peptide Antibodies (SISCAPA), Primary Immunodeficiency Disorders (PIDD), Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA), Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), newborn screening (NBS), Dried Blood Spot (DBS)",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6288356/,abstract

Drug responses are highly variable because innumerable factors contribute to ultimate phenotypic outcomes. Recent genome-wide PGx studies have provided some insight into genetic basis of variability in drug response. These can be grouped into three categories. [a] Monogenic (Mendelian) traits include early examples mostly of inherited disorders, and some severe (idiosyncratic) ADRs typically influenced by single rare coding variants. [b] Predominantly oligogenic traits represent variation largely influenced by a small number of major pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic genes. [c] Complex PGx traits resemble most multifactorial quantitative traits –– influenced by numerous small-effect variants, together with epigenetic effects and environmental factors. Prediction of monogenic drug responses is relatively simple, involving detection of underlying mutations; due to rarity of these events and incomplete penetrance, however, prospective tests based on genotype will have high false-positive rates, plus pharmacoeconomics will require justification. Prediction of predominantly oligogenic traits is slowly improving. Although a substantial fraction of variation can be explained by limited numbers of large-effect genetic variants, uncertainty in successful predictions and overall cost-benefit ratios will make such tests elusive for everyday clinical use. Prediction of complex PGx traits is almost impossible in the foreseeable future. Genome-wide association studies of large cohorts will continue to discover relevant genetic variants; however, these small-effect variants, combined, explain only a small fraction of phenotypic variance –– thus having limited predictive power and clinical utility.Keywords: Pharmacogenetics, Pharmacogenomics (PGx), Genetic risk prediction, Monogenic (Mendelian) PGx traits, Predominantly oligogenetic PGx traits, Complex PGx traits, Genetic architecture",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5653378/,abstract

Its natural cleavage product GLP-1 (9-36) lacks insulinotropic effects and has a low binding affinity for GLP-1 receptors; thus, GLP-1 (9-36) has historically been identified as an inactive metabolite. Conversely, recent work has demonstrated interesting physiological properties of GLP-1 (9-36) such as cardioprotection and neuroprotection. We have previously shown that GLP-1 (9-36) administration enhances neuronal plasticity in young WT mice and ameliorates cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we report that systemic administration of GLP-1 (9-36) in Ts65Dn DS model mice of either sex resulted in decreased mitochondrial oxidative stress in hippocampus and improved dendritic spine morphology, increase of mature spines and reduction of immature spines. Importantly, these molecular alterations translated into functional changes in that long-term potentiation failure and cognitive impairments in TsDn65 DS model mice were rescued with GLP-1 (9-36) treatment. We also show that chronic GLP-1 (9-36) treatment did not alter glucose tolerance in either WT or DS model mice.

unrealistic models for T2 distribution are limitations of
this approach. We present a novel framework for myelin imaging which substantially
increases the imaging speed and MWF estimation accuracy.MethodWe used the 2D multi-slice CPMG sequence to increase the volume coverage. To
compensate for non-ideal slice profiles, we numerically solved the Bloch equations for a
range of T2 and B1 inhomogeneity
scales to construct the bases for the estimation of the T2
distribution. We used a finite mixture of continuous parametric distributions to
describe the complete T2 spectrum and used the constrained
variable projection optimization algorithm to estimate MWF. To validate our model,
synthetic, phantom, and in-vivo brain experiments were conducted.ResultsUsing the Bloch equations we can model the slice profile and construct the

Early diagnosis and continuous treatment with a low Phe diet prevents severe neurological and cognitive impairment.Aims1. Analyze how treatment adherence evolves through infancy, childhood, and early adolescence in individuals with PKU. 2. Identify early signs of treatment discontinuation.MethodologyThis longitudinal, retrospective study included 75 children diagnosed through newborn screening, ages 7 to 13 years. Data on blood Phe concentration, number of blood samples sent, proportion of samples with Phe concentrations over the recommended range, and number of visits to the metabolism clinic were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the variables that predict treatment discontinuation before 13 years of age.ResultsA progressive increase in mean blood Phe concentrations with age was identified. The greatest increase occurred between the first and second years of life. By age ten, mean Phe blood concentration of the group was above the recommended range. The proportion of samples with Phe concentrations over the recommended range also increased with age, from an average of 13% during the first year of life to 67% in early adolescence. Sixty-eight percent of the children attended the outpatient clinic and sent samples from birth to the time of the study. Individuals who discontinued follow-up showed significantly higher mean blood Phe concentrations (360 vs. 220.9 μmol/L; p = 0.004) and the proportion of samples over the recommended range (37% vs. 12% p = 0.002) was significantly higher during the second year of life.

Metabolomics, the comprehensive analysis of low molecular weight molecules (metabolites) in biological samples, can provide new and earlier biomarkers of prenatal health. Recent research has suggested possible predictive first trimester urine metabolites correlating to fetal growth restriction in the third trimester. Our objective in this current study was to examine urinary metabolic profiles in the first and second trimester of pregnancy in relation to third trimester FGR in a US population from a large, multi-center cohort study of healthy pregnant women.MethodsWe conducted a nested case-control study within The Infant Development and the Environment Study (TIDES), a population-based multi-center pregnancy cohort study. We identified 53 cases of FGR based on the AUDIPOG [Neonatal growth - AUDIPOG [Internet]. [cited 29 Nov 2016]. Available from: http://www.audipog.net/courbes_morpho.php?langue=en] formula for birthweight percentile considering maternal height, age, and prenatal weight, as well as infant sex, gestational age, and birth rank. Cases were matched to 106 controls based on study site, maternal age (± 2 years), parity, and infant sex. NMR spectroscopy was used to assess concentrations of four urinary metabolites that have been previously associated with FGR (tyrosine, acetate, formate, and trimethylamine) in first and second trimester urine samples. We fit multivariate conditional logistic regression models to estimate the odds of FGR in relation to urinary concentrations of these individual metabolites in the first and second trimesters. Exploratory analyses of custom binned spectroscopy results were run to consider other potentially related metabolites.ResultsWe found no significant association between the relative concentrations of each of the four metabolites and odds of FGR. Exploratory analyses did not reveal any significant differences in urinary metabolic profiles. Compared with controls, cases delivered earlier (38.6 vs 39.8, p < 0.001), and had lower birthweights (2527 g vs 3471 g, p < 0.001). Maternal BMI was similar between cases and controls.ConclusionsFirst and second trimester concentrations of urinary metabolites (acetate, formate, trimethylamine and tyrosine) did not predict FGR. This inconsistency with previous studies highlights the need for more rigorous investigation and data collection in this area before metabolomics can be clinically applied to obstetrics.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12884-018-1674-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Obstetrics, NMR spectroscopy, Fetal growth restriction",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5806311/,abstract

Reduced PAH activity results in significant hyperphenylalaninemia, which leads to alterations in cerebral myelin and protein synthesis, as well as reduced levels of serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline in the brain. When untreated, brain development is grossly disrupted and significant intellectual impairment and behavioral disturbance occur. The advent of neonatal heel prick screening has allowed for diagnosis at birth, and the institution of a phenylalanine restricted diet. Dietary treatment, particularly when maintained across neurodevelopment and well into adulthood, has resulted in markedly improved outcomes at a cognitive and psychiatric level for individuals with PKU. However, few individuals can maintain full dietary control lifelong, and even with good control, an elevated risk remains of—in particular—mood, anxiety, and attentional disorders across the lifespan. Increasingly, dietary recommendations focus on maintaining continuous dietary treatment lifelong to optimize psychiatric and cognitive outcomes, although the effect of long-term protein restricted diets on brain function remains unknown. While psychiatric illness is very common in adult PKU populations, very little data exist to guide clinicians on optimal treatment. The advent of new treatments that do not require restrictive dietary management, such as the enzyme therapy Pegvaliase, holds the promise of allowing patients a relatively normal diet alongside optimized mental health and cognitive functioning.Keywords: phenylketonuria, psychiatric, anxiety, depression, cognitive function",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6748028/,abstract

The prevalence of feeding difficulties (FDs) and orofacial myofunctional disorders (OMDs) in these patients is unknown. Objective: To ascertain the prevalence of FDs and OMDs in GSD. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, prospective study of 36 patients (19 males; median age, 12.0 years; range, 8.0–18.7 years) with confirmed diagnoses of GSD (type Ia = 22; Ib = 8; III = 2; IXa = 3; IXc = 1). All patients were being treated by medical geneticists and dietitians. Evaluation included a questionnaire for evaluation of feeding behavior, the orofacial myofunctional evaluation (AMIOFE), olfactory and taste performance (Sniffin’ Sticks and Taste Strips tests), and facial anthropometry. Results: Nine (25%) patients had decreased olfactory perception, and four (11%) had decreased taste perception for all flavours. Eight patients (22.2%) had decreased perception for sour taste. Twenty-six patients (72.2%) had FD, and 18 (50%) had OMD. OMD was significantly associated with FD, tube feeding, selective intake, preference for fluid and semisolid foods, and mealtime stress (p < 0.05).

The primary aim of this study was to demonstrate that analysis of urine samples dried on filter paper by gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS) provides results similar to serum analyzed by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Secondary aims were to show that collection of four samples during the day (4-spot method) can be substituted for a 24-h collection, and that analysis of urine from dried samples is equivalent to liquid urine samples.MethodsThis prospective observational study compared results of urine and serum analyses. Urine samples from women throughout the menstrual cycle and single samples from postmenopausal women were evaluated. Urine was collected onto filter paper and dried. Dried urine was extracted, hydrolyzed, and derivatized prior to analysis by GC–MS/MS. Hormone concentrations were normalized to creatinine. Single samples were used to compare results of 24-h urine collection to the 4-spot method from a separate population of women and men. A subset of these samples were used to compare results from dried urine to liquid urine.ResultsThe primary study showed good reliability in the comparisons between the dried urine and serum assays. During the menstrual cycles of a subset of four women, urine metabolite concentrations followed the same pattern as serum concentrations. Comparison of 4-spot to 24-h urine collections and of dried to liquid urine measurements had intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) greater than 0.95, indicating excellent agreement.ConclusionsFor estradiol and progesterone, the dried urine assay is a good surrogate for serum testing. The 4-spot method can be used instead of 24-h urine collections and dried urine results are comparable to liquid urine.

Most cancer genomics studies focus on mutations that alter the amino acid sequence, ignoring the potential impact of synonymous mutations. However, accumulating experimental evidence has demonstrated clear consequences for gene function, leading to a widespread recognition of the functional role of synonymous mutations and their causal connection to various diseases. Here, we review the evidence supporting the direct impact of synonymous mutations on gene function via gene splicing; mRNA stability, folding, and translation; protein folding; and miRNA-based regulation of expression. These results highlight the functional contribution of synonymous mutations to oncogenesis and the need to further investigate their detection and prioritization for experimental assessment.The identification of cancer-causing mutations and the corresponding functionally impacted processes represents the main goal of cancer genomics. The inception of large collaborative efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) has led to the discovery of numerous causal or driver mutations in many cancer types. Nevertheless, tumors continue to be found in the absence of conspicuous mutational events, such as nucleotide substitutions, translocations or copy number variants involving genes with well-established tumorigenic connections. The lack of clear driver events in some cancers motivates the search for somatically acquired events that are more rare or have less obvious functional consequences but mechanistically converge on genes and pathways involved in oncogenesis and tumor progression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834044/,abstract

It is often regarded as the complement to the genome, with the interaction between the exposome and the genome ultimately determining one's phenotype. The ‘toxic exposome’ is the complete collection of chronically or acutely toxic compounds to which humans can be exposed. Considerable interest in defining the toxic exposome has been spurred on by the realization that most human injuries, deaths and diseases are directly or indirectly caused by toxic substances found in the air, water, food, home or workplace. The Toxin-Toxin-Target Database (T3DB - www.t3db.ca) is a resource that was specifically designed to capture information about the toxic exposome. Originally released in 2010, the first version of T3DB contained data on nearly 2900 common toxic substances along with detailed information on their chemical properties, descriptions, targets, toxic effects, toxicity thresholds, sequences (for both targets and toxins), mechanisms and references. To more closely align itself with the needs of epidemiologists, toxicologists and exposome scientists, the latest release of T3DB has been substantially upgraded to include many more compounds (>3600), targets (>2000) and gene expression datasets (>15 000 genes). It now includes extensive data on ‘normal’ toxic compound concentrations in human biofluids as well as detailed chemical taxonomies, informative chemical ontologies and a large number of referential NMR, MS/MS and GC-MS spectra.

The collection and analysis of such data has the potential to support various applications, including personalized medical services. While the benefits of the genomics revolution are trumpeted by the biomedical community, the increased availability of such data has major implications for personal privacy; notably because the genome has certain essential features, which include (but are not limited to) (i) an association with traits and certain diseases, (ii) identification capability (e.g., forensics), and (iii) revelation of family relationships. Moreover, direct-to-consumer DNA testing increases the likelihood that genome data will be made available in less regulated environments, such as the Internet and for-profit companies. The problem of genome data privacy thus resides at the crossroads of computer science, medicine, and public policy. While the computer scientists have addressed data privacy for various data types, there has been less attention dedicated to genomic data. Thus, the goal of this paper is to provide a systematization of knowledge for the computer science community.

One of the resulting major challenges refers to the management of primary or secondary residual executive function deficits in affected children. These deficits lead to problems in the ability to acquire, understand, and apply abstract and complex knowledge and to plan, direct, and control actions. Executive functions deficits are important to consider because they are highly predictive of functioning in social and academic aspects of daily life. We argue that current clinical practice does not sufficiently account for the complex cognitive processes in this population. This is because widely applied pharmacological interventions only rarely account for the complexity of the underlying neuronal mechanisms and do not fit well into possibly powerful “individualized medicine” approaches. Novel treatment approaches targeting deficits in executive functions in seriously ill children could focus on neuronal oscillations, as these have some specific relations to different aspects of executive function. Importantly, such treatment approaches can be individually tailored to the individuals’ deficits and can be transferred into home-treatment or e-health solutions. These approaches are easy-to-use, can be easily integrated into daily life, and are becoming increasingly cost-effective.Keywords: cognitive dysfunctions, executive function, therapy, cognitive training, chronic disease",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915456/,abstract

This is as true of nutrition-based intervention and prevention strategies as it is for pharmacotherapies and pharmaceutical-oriented prevention strategies. Essentially, technological breakthroughs have enabled researchers to probe an individual’s unique genetic, biochemical, physiological, behavioral and exposure profile, allowing them to identify very specific and often nuanced factors that an individual might possess that may make it more or less likely that he or she will respond favorably to a particular intervention (e.g., nutrient supplementation) or disease prevention strategy (e.g., specific diet). However, as compelling and intuitive as personalized nutrition might be in the current era in which data-intensive biomedical characterization of individuals is possible, appropriately and objectively vetting personalized nutrition strategies is not trivial and will require novel study designs and data analytical methods. These designs and methods must consider a very integrated use of the multiple contemporary biomedical assays and technologies that motivate them, which adds to their complexity. Single subject or ‘N-of-1’ trials can be used to assess the utility of personalized interventions and, in addition, can be crafted in such a way as to accommodate the necessary integrated use of many emerging biomedical technologies and assays.

We provide a number of example studies, discuss appropriate analytical methods given the complex data they will generate and require, and consider how such studies could leverage integration of various biomarker assays and clinical endpoints. Importantly, we also consider the development of strategies and ‘algorithms’ for matching nutritional needs to individual biomedical profiles and the issues surrounding them. Finally, we discuss the limitations of personalized nutrition studies, possible extensions of N-of-1 nutritional intervention studies and areas of future research.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6383767/,abstract

Nineteen of the 22 drugs exhibiting flip-flop kinetics were BDDCS Classes 3 and 4. One of the three exceptions, meclofenamic acid (Class 2), was identified in the horse however it would not exhibit flip-flop kinetics in humans where the oral dosing terminal half-life is 1.4 hr. The second, carvedilol, can be explained based on solubility issues, but the third sapropterin dihydrochloride (nominally Class 1) requires further consideration.ConclusionThe few drugs displaying oral flip-flop kinetics in humans are predominantly BDDCS Classes 3 and 4. New molecular entities predicted to be BDDCS Classes 3 and 4 could be liable to exhibit flip-flop kinetics when the elimination half life is short and should be suspected to be substrates for intestinal transporters.Keywords: BDDCS, flip-flop pharmacokinetics, half-life, oral drug absorption, transporters",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4536115/,abstract

Timely diagnosis and treatment of these disorders can have lasting effects on the mental development of newborns. However, there are several problems at different stages of screening programs that along with imposing heavy costs can reduce the precision of the screening, increasing the chance of undiagnosed cases which in turn can have damaging consequences for the society. Therefore, given these problems and the importance of information systems in facilitating the management and improving the quality of health care the aim of this study was to improve the screening process of hypothyroidism and PKU in infants with the help of electronic resources.Methods:The current study is a qualitative, action research designed to improve the quality of screening, services, performance, implementation effectiveness, and management of hypothyroidism and PKU screening program in Isfahan province. To this end, web-based software was designed. Programming was carried out using Delphi.net software and used SQL Server 2008 for database management.Findings:Given the weaknesses, problems, and limitations of hypothyroidism and PKU screening program, and the importance of these diseases in a national scale, this study resulted in design of hypothyroidism and PKU screening software for infants in Isfahan province. The inputs and outputs of the software were designed in three levels including Health Care Centers in charge of the screening program, provincial reference lab, and health and treatment network of Isfahan province. Immediate registration of sample data at the time and location of sampling, providing the provincial reference Laboratory and Health Centers of different eparchies with the ability to instantly observe, monitor, and follow-up on the samples at any moment, online verification of samples by reference lab, creating a daily schedule for reference lab, and receiving of the results from analysis equipment; and entering the results into the database without the need for user input are among the features of this software.Conclusion:The implementation of hypothyroidism screening software led to an increase in the quality and efficiency of the screening program; minimized the risk of human error in the process and solved many of the previous limitations of the screening program which were the main goals for implementation of this software. The implementation of this software also resulted in improvement in precision and quality of services provided for these two diseases and better accuracy and precision for data inputs by providing the possibility of entering the sample data at the place and time of sampling which then resulted in the possibility of management based on precise data and also helped develop a comprehensive database and improved the satisfaction of service recipients.Keywords: Hypothyroidism, infants, phenylketonuria, process digitalization, screening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5433631/,abstract

However, the factors that influence these decisions are poorly understood. This is particularly true for dietary proteins, which are important determinants of lifespan and reproduction. We show that in Drosophila melanogaster, essential amino acids (eAAs) and the concerted action of the commensal bacteria Acetobacter pomorum and Lactobacilli are critical modulators of food choice. Using a chemically defined diet, we show that the absence of any single eAA from the diet is sufficient to elicit specific appetites for amino acid (AA)-rich food. Furthermore, commensal bacteria buffer the animal from the lack of dietary eAAs: both increased yeast appetite and decreased reproduction induced by eAA deprivation are rescued by the presence of commensals. Surprisingly, these effects do not seem to be due to changes in AA titers, suggesting that gut bacteria act through a different mechanism to change behavior and reproduction. Thus, eAAs and commensal bacteria are potent modulators of feeding decisions and reproductive output. This demonstrates how the interaction of specific nutrients with the microbiome can shape behavioral decisions and life history traits.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5404834/,abstract

The most commonly used biomarker CA19-9 has inadequate sensitivity and specificity for early detection, which we define as Stage I/II cancers. Therefore, progress in next-generation biomarkers is greatly needed. Recent reports have validated a number of biomarkers, including combination assays of proteins and DNA mutations; however, the history of translating promising biomarkers to clinical utility suggests that several major hurdles require careful consideration by the medical community. The first set of challenges involves nominating and verifying biomarkers. Candidate biomarkers need to discriminate disease from benign controls with high sensitivity and specificity for an intended use, which we describe as a two-tiered strategy of identifying and screening high-risk patients. Community-wide efforts to share samples, data, and analysis methods have been beneficial and progress meeting this challenge has been achieved. The second set of challenges is assay optimization and validating biomarkers. After initial candidate validation, assays need to be refined into accurate, cost-effective, highly reproducible, and multiplexed targeted panels and then validated in large cohorts. To move the most promising candidates forward, ideally, biomarker panels, head-to-head comparisons, meta-analysis, and assessment in independent data sets might mitigate risk of failure. Much more investment is needed to overcome these challenges. The third challenge is achieving clinical translation. To moonshot an early detection test to the clinic requires a large clinical trial and organizational, regulatory, and entrepreneurial know-how. Additional factors, such as imaging technologies, will likely need to improve concomitant with molecular biomarker development. The magnitude of the clinical translational challenge is uncertain, but interdisciplinary cooperation within the PDAC community is poised to confront it.Keywords: pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, early detection, biomarkers, blood test, ELISA, mass spectrometry, circulating DNA, thrombospondin, CA19-9, KRAS",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876642/,abstract

The study objective was to evaluate screening consequences for primary congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in one- and two-screen states according to laboratory practices and medical or biochemical characteristics of screen-positive cases. Individual-level medical and biochemical data were retrospectively collected and analyzed for 2,251 primary CH cases in one-screen (CA, WI) and two-screen (AL, DE, MD, OR, TX) states. Aggregate data were collected and analyzed for medical and biochemical characteristics of all screened newborns in the states. Among the states evaluated in this study, the detection rate of primary CH was higher in the one-screen states. In the two-screen states, 11.5% of cases were detected on the second screen. In multivariate analyses, only race/ethnicity was a significant predictor of cases identified on the first versus second screen, which likely reflects a physiologic difference in primary CH presentation. Newborn screening programs must heed the potential for newborns with CH not being detected by a single screen, particularly newborns of certain races/ethnicities. If the two-screen states converted to a single screen using their current algorithms, newborns currently identified on the routine second screen would presumably not be detected, resulting in probable delayed diagnosis and treatment. However, based on the one-screen state experiences, with appropriate modifications in screening method and algorithm, the two-screen states might convert to single screen operation for CH without loss in performance.Keywords: Primary congenital hypothyroidism, Newborn screening, Race and ethnicity, Routine second screen",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4640971/,abstract

In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of p-coumaric acid. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of a major PAL from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor; SbPAL1), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. This first crystal structure of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner loop of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from 189Ala-Ser-Gly191 residues and the bound l-phenylalanine and l-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E2 reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups.

Due to this defect, toxic products accumulate which, in turn, cause liver and kidney dysfunction. Treatment with 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) and diet has diminished these problems, but recent data indicate that HT1 patients have neurocognitive problems. However, the neuropsychological profile of these patients is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate this neuropsychological profile by comparing HT1 patients with healthy controls.MethodsNeurocognitive testing was performed in a heterogeneous group of 19 NTBC and dietary treated HT1 patients (five female, fourteen male; mean age 12.9 ± 4.8 years; range 7.9–23.6 years) and 19 age and gender matched controls (five female, fourteen male; mean age 13.2 ± 4.6 years; range 8.1–24.8 years). IQ scores were estimated and all participants performed the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks, measuring executive functions (inhibition, cognitive flexibility and working memory) and social cognition (face recognition and identification of facial emotions).ResultsHT1 patients showed poorer estimated IQ, executive functioning (working memory and cognitive flexibility), and social cognition compared to healthy controls. Lower IQ scores in HT1 patients were mostly unrelated to scores on executive function- and social cognition tasks and therefore did not account for group differences in these domains. Further analyses within the HT1 patient group (comparing different groups of patients based on the age at diagnosis and the clinical symptoms at diagnosis) did not reveal any significant results. The duration of NTBC treatment was negatively correlated with IQ.ConclusionsDespite the heterogeneity of the patient group, these data clearly show that IQ, executive functioning and social cognition are affected in HT1 patients, and that IQ screening is not sufficient for cognitive monitoring of these patients. Further research should focus on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of these impairments to consequently try to improve treatment strategies.Keywords: Tyrosinemia type 1, Neurocognitive outcome, Executive functions, EF, Social cognition, IQ, Working memory, NTBC",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4928338/,abstract

Here, using such data we built a database and web service platform, miRNA disease regulatory network (miRDRN), for users to construct disease and tissue-specific miRNA-protein regulatory networks, with which they may explore disease related molecular and pathway associations, or find new ones, and possibly discover new modes of drug action.MethodsData on disease-miRNA association, miRNA-target association and validation, gene-tissue association, gene-tumor association, biological pathways, human protein interaction, gene ID, gene ontology, gene annotation, and product were collected from publicly available databases and integrated. A large set of miRNA target-specific regulatory sub-pathways (RSPs) having the form (T, G1, G2) was built from the integrated data and stored, where T is a miRNA-associated target gene, G1 (G2) is a gene/protein interacting with T (G1). Each sequence (T, G1, G2) was assigned a p-value weighted by the participation of the three genes in molecular interactions and reaction pathways.ResultsA web service platform, miRDRN (http://mirdrn.ncu.edu.tw/mirdrn/), was built.

From the regression models, it estimates the read depth ratio of the observed and predicted read depth with confidence interval for each probe which is applied to a circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm to obtain CNV candidates. Then, it assigns confidence scores to those candidates based on the reliability and strength of the CNV signals inferred from the read depth ratios of the probes within them.

the ability of different amino acids and phenylalanine analogues to

the fluorescence change that accompanies activation and on the activity
directly. At concentrations of 10–50 mM, d-phenylalanine, l-methionine, l-norleucine, and (S)-2-amino-3-phenyl-1-propanol were able to activate the enzyme to
the same extent as 1 mM l-phenylalanine. Lower levels of
activation were seen with l-4-aminophenylalanine, l-leucine, l-isoleucine, and 3-phenylpropionate. The ability
of these compounds to stabilize the regulatory domain dimer agreed
with their ability to activate the enzyme. These results support a

Patients were classified into 6 different groups: control group of healthy participants, phenylketonuric patients (PKU), patients with mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), patients with other inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), patients with neurogenetic diseases, and individuals with neurological diseases with no genetic diagnosis. Plasma total CoQ was measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and ultraviolet detection at 275 nm. ANOVA with Bonferroni correction showed that plasma CoQ values were significantly lower in the PKU and MPS groups than in controls and neurological patients. The IEM group showed intermediate values that were not significantly different from those of the controls. In PKU patients, the Chi-Square test showed a significant association between having low plasma CoQ values and being classic PKU patients. The percentage of neurogenetic and other neurological patients with low CoQ values was low (below 8%).

To date, however, establishing the proposed inverted-U pattern of age-myelin association proved difficult, as the most common method of investigating white matter, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), usually reveals only linear associations between DTI indices and age among healthy adults. Here we use a novel method of estimating Myelin Water Fraction (MWF) based on modeling the short spin-spin (T2) relaxation component from multi-echo T2 relaxation imaging data and assess subcortical myelin content within six white matter tracts in a sample of healthy adults (N=61, age 18–84 years). Myelin content evidenced a quadratic relationship with age, in accord with the pattern observed postmortem studies. In contrast, DTI-derived indices that are frequently cited as proxies for myelination, fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD), exhibited linear or null relationships with age. Furthermore, the magnitude of age differences in MWF varied across the white matter tracts. Myelin content estimated by MWF was unrelated to FA and correlated with RD only in the splenium. These findings are consistent with the notion that myelination continues throughout the young adulthood into the middle age. The results demonstrate that DTI cannot serve as a specific proxy for myelination of white matter tracts.Keywords: Aging, Brain, White Matter, Multi-exponential T2 relaxation, Fractional Anisotropy",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5124541/,abstract

A peak calling pipeline developed in R programming language provided Z-scores for ~1875 mass peaks corresponding to ~3835 metabolite annotations (including isomers) per sample. Based on metabolite Z-scores, patients were assigned a ‘most probable diagnosis’ by an investigator blinded for the known diagnoses of the patients. Based on DBS sample analysis, 37/42 of the patients, corresponding to 22/23 IEM, could be correctly assigned a ‘most probable diagnosis’. Plasma sample analysis, resulted in a correct ‘most probable diagnosis’ in 32/38 of the patients, corresponding to 19/21 IEM. The added clinical value of the method was illustrated by a case wherein DI-HRMS metabolomics aided interpretation of a variant of unknown significance (VUS) identified by whole-exome sequencing.

An approach different from blocking the formation or action of angiotensin II(1-8) that could also be effective involves fostering its degradation. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a monocarboxypeptidase than cleaves angiotensin II (1-8) to form angiotensin (1-7). Therefore, we examined the renal effects of murine recombinant ACE2 in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy as well as that of amplification of circulating ACE2 using minicircle DNA delivery prior to induction of experimental diabetes. This delivery resulted in a long-term sustained and profound increase in serum ACE2 activity and enhanced ability to metabolize an acute angiotensin II (1-8) load. In mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes pretreated with minicircle ACE2, ACE2 protein in plasma increased markedly and this was associated with a more than 100-fold increase in serum ACE2 activity. However, minicircle ACE2 did not result in changes in urinary ACE2 activity as compared to untreated diabetic mice. In both diabetic groups, glomerular filtration rate increased significantly and to the same extent as compared to non-diabetic controls. Albuminuria, glomerular mesangial expansion, glomerular cellularity and glomerular size, were all increased to a similar extent in minicircle ACE2-treated and untreated diabetic mice, as compared to non-diabetic controls. Recombinant mouse ACE2 given for 4 weeks by intraperitoneal daily injections in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy also failed to improve albuminuria or kidney pathology. Thus, a profound augmentation of ACE2 confined to the circulation failed to ameliorate the glomerular lesions and hyperfiltration characteristic of early diabetic nephropathy.

Because of the difficulty of interpretation of the primary definition, the NOVA group and others have set out lists of examples of foods that fall under the category of ultra-processed foods. The present manuscript demonstrates that since the inception of the NOVA classification of foods, these examples of foods to which this category applies have varied considerably. Thus, there is little consistency either in the definition of ultra-processed foods or in examples of foods within this category.

Introduction: This study is part of the “European network and registry for intoxication type metabolic diseases” (E-IMD) project. Intoxication-type inborn errors of metabolism (IT-IEM) such as urea cycle disorders (UCD) and organic acidurias (OA) have a major impact on patients’ lives. Patients have to adhere to strict diet and medication and may suffer from metabolic crises and neurocognitive impairment. Disease-specific health-related quality of life (HrQoL) assessment questionnaires are the method of choice to estimate the subjective burden of a disease. To date, no such instrument is available for IT-IEM.
Methods: Disease-specific patient- and parent-reported HrQoL questions were constructed in German based on focus group interviews with patients and parents. Questionnaires for patients from 8 to 18 years were piloted with 14 participants (n = 9 children and adolescents, n = 5 parents) by cognitive debriefing and tested psychometrically with 80 participants (n = 38 patients, n = 42 parents) for item characteristics, validity, and reliability to construct the first version of a disease-specific HrQoL questionnaire.
Results: Twenty-eight questions were selected based on item descriptives. Scales of self- and proxy questionnaires demonstrated acceptable to excellent reliability in terms of internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.70–0.93). Scales and total scores correlated with those of generic HrQoL questionnaires, showing convergent validity.
Discussion: The MetabQoL 1.0 questionnaire exhibits sound psychometric properties and is a promising step towards assessing patient-reported outcomes in research and clinical practice. It provides a solid basis for translation into other languages and further elaboration and psychometric exploration in larger populations.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this chapter (doi:10.1007/8904_2017_11) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Inborn errors of metabolism, Organic acidurias, Quality of life, Questionnaire, Urea cycle disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5740049/,abstract

Individually rare, their cumulative incidence is thought to be high, but it has not yet been estimated globally. Although outcomes can often be good if recognised early, IEM carry a high fatality rate if not diagnosed. As a result, IEM may contribute significantly to the burden of non-communicable childhood morbidity.MethodsWe conducted a systematic literature review of birth prevalence and case fatality of IEM globally, with search dates set from 1980 to 2017. Using random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated birth prevalence of separate classes of IEM and all-cause IEM, split by geographical region. We also estimated levels of parental consanguinity in IEM cases and global case fatality rates and resultant child deaths from all-cause IEM.Findings49 studies met our selection criteria. We estimate the global birth prevalence of all-cause IEM to be 50.9 per 100 000 live births (95% confidence intervals (CI) = 43.4-58.4). Regional pooled birth prevalence rates showed the highest rates of IEM to be in the Eastern Mediterranean region (75.7 per 100 000 live births, 95% CI = 50.0-101.4), correlating with a higher observed rate of parental consanguinity in studies from this area.

Sex-separated analyses revealed similar significant effects for males (OR=0.62) and females (OR=0.71). Analyses of the matched case-control data revealed, using the t-test statistic, that the mean date of birth among cases diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (2000.5±1.2) was significantly more in the past than in controls (2001.1±1.3).

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of piroxicam and diclofenac sodium as treatments for primary dysmenorrhea.Material/MethodsThe study was conducted using a randomized and double-blind method. Patients with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores greater than 5 were accepted into the study. The patients who were suitable for inclusion were randomized into 2 groups and received either intramuscular piroxicam or diclofenac sodium. The patients’ pain levels were measured at baseline and at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. A VAS of 10 cm, a numeric scale, a verbal scale, and additional symptoms, as well as pain relapse after 24 hours and required analgesics, were recorded.ResultsThe study included 400 patients. Overall, 200 patients (50%) were in the proxicam group, and 200 patients were in the diclofenac sodium group. The average decrease on the VAS after piroxicam or diclofenac administration was measured as 7.9±1.8 cm and 7.9±1.7 cm (median ± standard deviation), respectively. The pain-reducing efficiency of all the treatments was compared using the Mann-Whitney U test (p=0.929). Rescue medication was needed for 25 patients in the proxicam group (p=0.014). Overall, 30 patients in the proxicam group and 41 patients in the proxicam group needed analgesics again in the 24-hour period after treatment (p=0.150).ConclusionsAt the end of our study, it was observed that there was no difference in the results of primary dysmenorrhea treatment with 20 mg piroxicam or 75 mg diclofenac sodium.MeSH Keywords: Diclofenac, Dysmenorrhea, Emergency Service, Hospital, Piroxicam",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6330839/,abstract

With the accelerated pace of generating mutant alleles, genotyping has become a rate-limiting step to understanding the effects of genetic perturbation. Unless mutated alleles result in distinct morphological phenotypes, mutant strains need to be genotyped using standard methods in molecular biology. Classic restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or sequencing is labor-intensive and expensive. Although simpler than RFLP, current versions of allele-specific PCR may still require post-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) handling such as sequencing, or they are more expensive if allele-specific fluorescent probes are used. Commercial genotyping solutions can take weeks from assay design to result, and are often more expensive than assembling reactions in-house. Key components of commercial assay systems are often proprietary, which limits further customization. Therefore, we developed a one-step open-source genotyping method based on quantitative PCR. The allele-specific qPCR (ASQ) does not require post-PCR processing and can genotype germline mutants through either threshold cycle (Ct) or end-point fluorescence reading. ASQ utilizes allele-specific primers, a locus-specific reverse primer, universal fluorescent probes and quenchers, and hot start DNA polymerase. Individual laboratories can further optimize this open-source system as we completely disclose the sequences, reagents, and thermal cycling protocol. We have tested the ASQ protocol to genotype alleles in five different genes. ASQ showed a 98–100% concordance in genotype scoring with RFLP or Sanger sequencing outcomes. ASQ is time-saving because a single qPCR without post-PCR handling suffices to score genotypes. ASQ is cost-effective because universal fluorescent probes negate the necessity of designing expensive probes for each locus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4931339/,abstract

Ninety-two infants (median gestational age 28 weeks, Interquartile range (IQR) 26–29; mean birth weight 1040 g, SD 300 g) were studied. Infants born weighing <1000 g were underfed protein compared with recommendations (median (IQR) intake of 3.0 (2.0–3.7) g/kg/day in week 2 versus recommendation of 4–4.5 g/kg/day), while those born weighing ≥1000 g met recommended protein intakes after the first week of life (median (IQR) intake of 3.7 (3.0–4.0) g/kg/day in week 2 versus recommendation of 3.5–4.5 g/kg/day). A moderate, negative correlation between the mean number of breast feeds and change in rate of weight gain (r = −0.37, p = 0.001) was found. Protein intakes of infants <1000 g did not meet recommendations and all infants were underfed protein and energy in the first week of life.

For each scenario, we varied the terminology used to describe treatment options. One survey version used the term intervention and the other treatment. The outcome measured for each scenario was perceived benefit (for the infant) and importance of testing (for participants). Comparisons were made between participants and between scenarios. Ratings of benefit and importance were not influenced by the use of the term intervention versus treatment within scenarios. Nuances existed in ratings of benefit to the infant and importance to participants amongst scenarios. Participants were most likely to perceive benefit and importance in screening for a disorder if treatment/intervention offered a high chance of improved outcomes.

In addition to EHMT1 mutations, de novo variants were reported in four additional genes (MBD5, SMARCB1, NR1I3, and KMT2C), in single individuals with clinical characteristics overlapping Kleefstra syndrome. Here, we present a novel cohort of five patients with de novo loss of function mutations affecting the histone methyltransferase KMT2C. Our clinical data delineates the KMT2C phenotypic spectrum and reinforces the phenotypic overlap with Kleefstra syndrome and other related ID disorders. To elucidate the common molecular basis of the neuropathology associated with mutations in KMT2C and EHMT1, we characterized the role of the Drosophila KMT2C ortholog, trithorax related (trr), in the nervous system. Similar to the Drosophila EHMT1 ortholog, G9a, trr is required in the mushroom body for short term memory. Trr ChIP-seq identified 3371 binding sites, mainly in the promoter of genes involved in neuronal processes. Transcriptional profiling of pan-neuronal trr knockdown and G9a null mutant fly heads identified 613 and 1123 misregulated genes, respectively. These gene sets show a significant overlap and are associated with nearly identical gene ontology enrichments. The majority of the observed biological convergence is derived from predicted indirect target genes. However, trr and G9a also have common direct targets, including the Drosophila ortholog of Arc (Arc1), a key regulator of synaptic plasticity.

Animal studies have provided proof-of-concept that enzyme replacement therapy could represent a long-term therapeutic option. The characterization of neuronal stem cells (NSCs) derived from aldehyde dehydrogenase 5a1−/− (aldh5a1−/−) mice, the murine model of SSADHD, has highlighted NSC utility as an in vitro system in which to study therapeutics and associated toxicological properties. Gene expression analyses have revealed that transcripts encoding GABAA receptors are down-regulated and may remain largely immature in aldh5a1−/− brain, characterized by excitatory as opposed to inhibitory outputs, the latter being the expected action in the mature central nervous system. This indicates that agents altering chloride channel activity may be therapeutically relevant in SSADHD.

Patients ≥12 years of age with PKU were systematically challenged with additional natural protein (NP) if blood Phe levels remained below 480 µmol/L (i.e., upper target blood Phe level for patients aged ≥12 years using Portuguese PKU guidelines). In PKU patients, NP tolerance was calculated at baseline and a median of 6 months after systematic challenge with NP whilst patients were maintaining a blood Phe ≤480 μmol/L. Anthropometry was assessed at both times. Routine blood Phe levels were collected. We studied 40 well-controlled PKU patients (10 hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), 23 mild and 7 classic PKU), on a low-Phe diet with a mean age of 17 years (12–29 years). Median daily NP intake significantly increased between assessments (35 vs. 40 g/day, p = 0.01). Twenty-six patients (65%) were able to increase their median NP intake by a median 12 g/day (2–42 g)/day and still maintain blood Phe within target range. Out of the previous 26 patients, 20 (77%) (8 HPA, 11 mild and 1 classical PKU) increased NP from animal sources (e.g., dairy products, fish and meat) and 6 patients (23%) (3 mild and 3 classical PKU) from plant foods (bread, pasta, potatoes). Median protein equivalent intake from Phe-free/low-Phe protein substitute decreased (0.82 vs. 0.75 g/kg, p = 0.01), while median blood Phe levels remained unchanged (279 vs. 288 μmol/L, p = 0.06). Almost two-thirds of patients with PKU tolerated additional NP when challenged and still maintained blood Phe within the national target range. This suggests that some patients with PKU treated by a low-Phe diet only may over restrict their NP intake. In order to minimise the burden of treatment and optimise NP intake, it is important to challenge with additional NP at periodic intervals.Keywords: BH4, natural protein tolerance, phenylketonuria, phenylalanine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6566391/,abstract

The method was validated with 259 simultaneous plasma and DBS αFP measurements in 171 children (132 controls and 39 patients with BWSp). Results: The DBS and plasma measurements overlapped across the wide range of αFP concentrations independent of patient age (p < 0.0001), demonstrating the utility of this method for longitudinal monitoring. Occasional differences between measurements by the two techniques fell within standard laboratory error and would not alter clinical management. Conclusions: This novel method shows consistent overlap with the traditional blood draws, thereby demonstrating its utility for hepatoblastoma screening in this setting and alleviating the burden of frequent blood draws.

To apply myelin water imaging in multisite studies and clinical applications, it must be acquired in a clinically feasible scan time (less than 15 min) and be reproducible across sites and scanner vendors. Here, we assessed the reproducibility of MWF measurements in regional and global white matter in 10 healthy human brains across two sites with two different 3 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner vendors (Philips and Siemens), using a 32-echo gradient and spin echo (GRASE) sequence. A strong correlation was found between the MWF measurements in the global white matter (Pearson’s r = 0.91; p < 0.001) for all participants across the two sites. The mean intersite MWF coefficient of variation across participants was 2.77% in the global white matter and ranged from 4.47% (splenium of the corpus callosum) to 17.89% (genu of the corpus callosum) in white matter regions of interest. Bland-Altman analysis showed a good agreement in MWF measurements between the two sites with small bias of 0.002.

Thirty-eight parents of children and adolescents with PKU and 32 parents in the general population completed the questionnaires measuring parental psychological resilience, child behaviour problems, perceived social support and distress. Parents of children with PKU also completed measures of their child’s care dependency and behaviour related to developmental and intellectual disabilities. The findings revealed no statistically significant differences in distress between the groups, but parents of children with PKU reported more child behaviour problems. Multiple regression analysis identified that parental psychological resilience and child anxious behaviour explained 35% of the variance in distress for parents of children with PKU. By comparison, parental psychological resilience and generic child behaviour only accounted for 19% of the variance in distress for parents in the general population. This has implications for developing interventions in clinical settings that aim to reduce parents’ distress by enhancing their psychological resilience and supporting them to manage child behaviour difficulties, particularly anxious behaviour.

The interferon-induced antiviral effector protein MxA exerts a broad antiviral activity against many viruses. MxA is a dynamin-like GTPase and has the capacity to form oligomeric structures of higher order. However, whether oligomerization of MxA is required for its antiviral activity is an issue of debate. We describe here a simple protocol to assess the oligomeric state of endogenously or ectopically expressed MxA in the cytoplasmic fraction of human cell lines by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in combination with Western blot analysis. A critical step of the protocol is the choice of detergents to prevent aggregation and/or precipitation of proteins particularly associated with cellular membranes such as MxA, without interfering with its enzymatic activity. Another crucial aspect of the protocol is the irreversible protection of the free thiol groups of cysteine residues by iodoacetamide to prevent artificial interactions of the protein. This protocol is suitable for a simple assessment of the oligomeric state of MxA and furthermore allows a direct correlation of the antiviral activity of MxA interface mutants with their respective oligomeric states.Keywords: Biochemistry, Issue 116, Oligomerization, non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), western blot analysis, myxovirus resistance A (MxA) protein, multi-subunit protein complexes, quaternary structure",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5226139/,abstract

Urine-derived epithelial cells (UCs) from a 15-year-old male patient with PKU were isolated and reprogrammed with integration-free episomal vectors carrying an OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and miR-302-367 cluster. PKU-UiPSCs were verified as correct using alkaline phosphatase staining. Pluripotency markers were detected with real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Promoter methylation in two pluripotent genes, NANOG and OCT4, was analyzed using bisulphite sequencing. An embryoid body (EB) formation assay was also performed. An induced pluripotent stem cell line (iPSC) was generated from epithelial cells in urine from a patient with PKU. This cell line had increased expression of stem cell biomarkers, it efficiently formed EBs, it stained positive for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and it had a marked decrease in promoter methylation in the NANOG and OCT4 genes.

Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is one form of PID which is uniformly fatal without early, definitive therapy, and outcomes are significantly improved if infants are diagnosed and treated within the first few months of life. Screening for SCID using T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis has been introduced in many countries worldwide. The utility of additional screening with kappa recombining excision circles (KREC) has also been described, enabling identification of infants with severe forms of PID manifested by T and B cell lymphopenia. Here, we review the early origins of newborn screening and the evolution of screening methodologies.

In addition, the specialized metabolism may leave a unique metabolic signature which could be used clinically for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. Quantitative global metabolic profiling (metabolomics) has evolved over the last two decades. However, despite the technology’s present ability to measure 1000s of endogenous metabolites in various clinical or biological specimens, there are essentially no examples of metabolomics investigations being translated into actual utility in the cancer clinic.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine serum BA reference values in term and preterm neonates. Furthermore, as serum BA concentrations are well-known to rise in septic adults, BA values were determined in early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS), a common and serious disease in neonates.Using high-performance liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS), we profiled serum BA in 236 infants, including healthy term neonates (n = 84), premature infants (n = 101), and both term infants (n = 35) and preterm infants (n = 16) with EOS. We examined the impact of prematurity and EOS on BA concentrations.The median reference values of serum BA were 8.0 μmol/L, interquartile range (IQR): 4.6 to 12.9, in healthy term neonates and 10.1 μmol/L, IQR: 5.7 to 15.7, in preterm neonates. Neonates with EOS had significantly lower median BA values, term (4.7 μmol/L, IQR: 2.7–7.6; P < 0.01) as well as preterm (6.4 μmol/L, IQR: 3.5–8.4; P < 0.01).

The objective of this study was to assess whether the measurement of glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in DBS samples provided comparative and acceptably precise results.MethodsVenous and capillary blood samples were collected from 115 adult participants. After proper instruction, each participant punctured his/her own finger and collected capillary blood samples on pieces of a proprietary cellulose filter paper. Each filter paper was subsequently placed inside a breathable envelope, stored at room temperature, and processed on the same day (D0), four (D4), seven (D7) and fourteen (D14) days after collection. HbA1c was measured in duplicates/triplicates in whole venous blood (WB), capillary blood (capDBS) and venous blood placed on the matrix paper (venDBS), by turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay. Intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated. DBS values were compared to WB results using linear regression, Bland-Altman plots and cross-validation models.ResultsEleven and 56 patients had type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively. Mean HbA1c levels were 6.22 ± 1.11 % for WB samples (n = 115). The median intra-assay CV was lower than 3 % for WB and capDBS on all days. Results from capDBS and venDBS showed high correlation and agreement to WB results, with narrow 95 % limits of agreement (except for results from D14 samples), as observed in Bland-Altman plots. When capDBS values were applied to equations derived from regression analyses, results approached those of WB values. A cross-validation model showed that capDBS results on D0, D4 and D7 were close to the WB results, with prediction intervals that were narrow enough to be clinically acceptable.ConclusionsThe measurement of HbA1c from DBS samples provided results that were comparable to results from WB samples, if measured up to seven days after collection. Intra-assay coefficients of variation were low, results were in agreement with the gold-standard, and prediction intervals were clinically acceptable.

However, a major limitation of liver donors exists. Living donor liver transplantation (LDL﻿T), split liver transplantation (SLT), and domino liver transplantation (DLT) are some of the available alternatives to treat ALF patients, but these do not reduce the number of patients on waiting lists.

Methods We conducted a literature search on PubMed/Medline using acute liver failure, liver transplantation, hepatocyte transplantation, and domino liver transplantation as key words. Results New sources of biochemically functional hepatocytes and therapeutic treatments, in parallel to organ transplantation, may improve liver injury recovery and decrease mortality rates. Moreover, the literature reports hepatocyte transplantation as a therapeutic alternative for organ shortage. However, a major challenge remains for a wide clinical application of hepatocytes therapy, i.e., the availability of sufficient amounts of cells for transplantation.

However, there are great variations in practice, both in terms of disorders covered, screening technologies, disease definition, information provision, parental informed consent, and storage and disposal of residual specimens, partly reflecting the degree to which screening is the subject of explicit legislation (and thus public and media pressure) or is embedded in a general health care system and managed at an executive level. It is generally accepted that disorders to be screened for should comply with the ten Wilson and Jungner criteria, but the way that compliance is assessed ranges from broadly-based opinion surveys to detailed analysis of quantitative data. Consequently, even countries with comparable levels of economic development and health care show large differences in the number of disorders screened for. There are several areas on which there are no generally accepted guidelines: how should parents be informed about screening and to what extent should they be encouraged to regard screening as an option to choose to refuse?

233,10.3389/fnins.2016.00192,27242398,"Go to:AbstractThis manuscript reviews biological abnormalities shared by autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy. Two neuropathological findings are shared by ASD and epilepsy: abnormalities in minicolumn architecture and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. The peripheral neuropil, which is the region that contains the inhibition circuits of the minicolumns, has been found to be decreased in the post-mortem ASD brain. ASD and epilepsy are associated with inhibitory GABA neurotransmission abnormalities including reduced GABAA and GABAB subunit expression. These abnormalities can elevate the excitation-to-inhibition balance, resulting in hyperexcitablity of the cortex and, in turn, increase the risk of seizures. Medical abnormalities associated with both epilepsy and ASD are discussed. These include specific genetic syndromes, specific metabolic disorders including disorders of energy metabolism and GABA and glutamate neurotransmission, mineral and vitamin deficiencies, heavy metal exposures and immune dysfunction. Many of these medical abnormalities can result in an elevation of the excitatory-to-inhibitory balance. Fragile X is linked to dysfunction of the mGluR5 receptor and Fragile X, Angelman and Rett syndromes are linked to a reduction in GABAA receptor expression. Defects in energy metabolism can reduce GABA interneuron function. Both pyridoxine dependent seizures and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency cause GABA deficiencies while urea cycle defects and phenylketonuria cause abnormalities in glutamate neurotransmission. Mineral deficiencies can cause glutamate and GABA neurotransmission abnormalities and heavy metals can cause mitochondrial dysfunction which disrupts GABA metabolism. Thus, both ASD and epilepsy are associated with similar abnormalities that may alter the excitatory-to-inhibitory balance of the cortex. These parallels may explain the high prevalence of epilepsy in ASD and the elevated prevalence of ASD features in individuals with epilepsy.Keywords: autism spectrum disorder, seizures, epilepsy, genetic syndrome, metabolic disorders, excitatory-to-inhibitory cortical balance, gamma-aminobutyric acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4861974/,abstract

Metabolomics has a potential advantage in researching the relationship between external factors and CHD. Objective To find and identify the urinary potential biomarkers of pregnancy (including in the second and third trimesters) for fetuses with CHD based on modified gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), which could reveal the possibility of high-risk factors for CHD and lay the foundation for early intervention, treatment, and prevention. Methods Using a case-control design, we measured the urinary potential biomarkers of maternal urine metabolomics based on GC-MS in a population-based sample of women whose infants were diagnosed with CHD (70 case subjects) or were healthy (70 control subjects). SIMCA-P 13.0 software, principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, and logistics regression were used to find significant potential biomarkers. Result The 3D score graph of the OPLS-DA showed that the CHD and control groups were fully separated. The fitting parameters were R2x=0.78 and R2y=0.69, and the forecast rate was Q2=0.61, indicating a high forecast ability. According to the ranking of VIPs from the OPLS-DA models, we found 34 potential metabolic markers with a VIP > 1, and after two pairwise rank sum tests, we found 20 significant potential biomarkers, which were further used in multifactor logistic regressions. Significant substances, including 4-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid (OR=4.74, 95% CI: 1.06-21.06), 5-trimethylsilyloxy-n-valeric acid (OR=15.78, 95% CI: 2.33-106.67), propanedioic acid (OR=5.37, 95% CI: 1.87-15.45), hydracrylic acid (OR=6.23, 95% CI: 1.07-36.21), and uric acid (OR=5.23, 95% CI: 1.23-22.32), were associated with CHD.

All infants had newborn metabolic screening data available. Data included linked birth certificate and mother and infant hospital discharge records. Mortality was derived from linked death certificates and death discharge information. Each death within 7 days was matched to 4 surviving controls by gestational age and birth weight z score category, leaving 93 cases and 372 controls. The association between explanatory variables and 7-day survival was modeled via stepwise logistic regression. Infant characteristics, 42 metabolites, and 12 metabolite ratios were considered for model inclusion. Model performance was assessed via area under the curve.ResultsThe final model included 1 characteristic and 11 metabolites. The model demonstrated a strong association between metabolic patterns and infant survival (area under the curve [AUC] 0.885, 95% CI 0.851-0.920). Furthermore, a model with just the selected metabolites performed better (AUC 0.879, 95% CI 0.841-0.916) than a model with multiple clinical characteristics (AUC 0.685, 95% CI 0.627-0.742).ConclusionsUse of metabolomics significantly strengthens the association with 7-day survival in infants born extremely premature. Physicians may be able to use metabolic profiles at birth to refine mortality risks and inform postnatal counseling for infants born at <26 weeks of gestation.Abbreviations: AUC, Area under the curve; IVH, Intraventricular hemorrhage; NBS, Newborn screening; NRN, Neonatal Research Network; ROC, Receiver operating curve; TPN, Total parenteral nutrition",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6016556/,abstract

Though early and continuously treated PKU (ETPKU) patients exhibit normal IQ, their cognitive outcome remains suboptimal. In this longitudinal study, we aimed at assessing the determinants of IQ subscales and quality of metabolic control in ETPKU children.We collected blood Phe levels, numbers of blood samples for Phe determination, parents' socio-professional categories and school achievement data of 39 classical and moderate ETPKU patients who underwent two cognitive evaluations performed by the same neuropsychologist (at 6.5 and 10y of mean age). We then sought to evaluate the determinants of 1) the changes in their IQ between the two testings (delta IQ) and 2) the quality of metabolic control (evaluated by the median Phe levels during the year before the second test) with multivariate regression analysis.Though in the normal range, mean total IQ slightly decreased between the two evaluations, and we observed a better verbal than performance outcome. Modeling the determining factors of the delta IQ, we found a significant influence of the number of blood samples (β = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.13 to 0.79, p < 0.01) and the moderate type of PKU (β = 12.40, 95%CI = 3.69 to 21.11, p < 0.01) on verbal outcome.

The precise molecular and cellular basis underlying PD still remains uncertain; however, accumulating evidence suggests that neuronal cell death is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Over the previous two decades, more than 20 genes have been identified as the cause of and/or risk for PD. Because sporadic and familial forms of PD have many similarities in clinical and neuropathological features, common molecular pathways, such as aberrant mitochondrial and protein homeostasis, are likely to exist in both conditions. Of the various genes and proteins involved in PD, the versatile DnaJ/Hsp40 co-chaperones have attracted particular attention since several genes encoding this protein family have been successively identified as the cause of the familial forms of PD/Parkinsonism. In this review, we will introduce the current knowledge regarding the integratory and modulatory effect of DnaJ/Hsp40 in various cellular functions and argue how the failure of these proteins may initiate and/or facilitate of the disease.Keywords: DnaJ protein, Hsp40, co-chaperones, Parkinson's disease, neurodegeneration",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5767785/,abstract

The exact mechanisms by which HPDs exert their effects are unclear. However, evidence suggests that the sensing of amino acids produced as a result of protein digestion may have a role in appetite regulation and satiety. We investigated the effects of l-phenylalanine (L-Phe) on food intake and glucose homeostasis in rodents.Methods:We investigated the effects of the aromatic amino-acid and calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) agonist l-phenylalanine (L-Phe) on food intake and the release of the gastrointestinal (GI) hormones peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and ghrelin in rodents, and the role of the CaSR in mediating these effects in vitro and in vivo. We also examined the effect of oral l-Phe administration on glucose tolerance in rats.Results:Oral administration of l-Phe acutely reduced food intake in rats and mice, and chronically reduced food intake and body weight in diet-induced obese mice. Ileal l-Phe also reduced food intake in rats. l-Phe stimulated GLP-1 and PYY release, and reduced plasma ghrelin, and also stimulated insulin release and improved glucose tolerance in rats. Pharmacological blockade of the CaSR attenuated the anorectic effect of intra-ileal l-Phe in rats, and l-Phe-induced GLP-1 release from STC-1 and primary L cells was attenuated by CaSR blockade.Conclusions:l-Phe reduced food intake, stimulated GLP-1 and PYY release, and reduced plasma ghrelin in rodents. Our data provide evidence that the anorectic effects of l-Phe are mediated via the CaSR, and suggest that l-Phe and the CaSR system in the GI tract may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of obesity and diabetes.

When not detected on time, they can lead to irreversible physiological and psychological sequels or even demise. Metabolomics has emerged as an efficient and powerful tool for IEM detection in newborns, children, and adults with late onset. In here, we screened urine samples from a large set of neonates (470 individuals) from a homogeneous population (Basque Country), for the identification of congenital metabolic diseases using NMR spectroscopy. Absolute quantification allowed to derive a probability function for up to 66 metabolites that adequately describes their normal concentration ranges in newborns from the Basque Country. The absence of another 84 metabolites, considered abnormal, was routinely verified in the healthy newborn population and confirmed for all but 2 samples, of which one showed toxic concentrations of metabolites associated to ketosis and the other one a high trimethylamine concentration that strongly suggested an episode of trimethylaminuria.

Consumers of AmED beverages are more likely to engage in heavy episodic (binge) drinking. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the consumption of high caffeine energy drink mixers with alcohol would increase the desire to drink alcohol compared to the same amount of alcohol alone using a double-blind, within-subjects, placebo-controlled study design.MethodsParticipants (n = 26) of equal gender who were social drinkers attended 6 double-blind dose administration sessions that involved consumption of alcohol and energy drinks, alone and in combination. On each test day, participants received 1 of 6 possible doses: 1) 1.21 ml/kg vodka + 3.63 ml/kg decaffeinated soft drink, 2) 1.21 ml/kg vodka + 3.63 ml/kg energy drink, 3) 1.21 ml/kg vodka + 6.05 ml/kg energy drink, 4) 3.36 ml/kg decaffeinated soft drink, 5) 3.36 ml/kg energy drink, and 6) 6.05 ml/kg energy drink. Following dose administration, participants repeatedly completed self-reported ratings on the Desire for Drug questionnaire and provided breath alcohol readings.ResultsAlcohol alone increased the subjective ratings of “desire for more alcohol” compared to placebo doses. Energy drink mixers with the alcohol increased desire for more alcohol ratings beyond that observed with alcohol alone.ConclusionsThis study provides laboratory evidence that AmED beverages lead to greater desire to drink alcohol versus the same amount of alcohol consumed alone.

It is essential that differential diagnosis be conducted to distinguish these two causes of HPA, because BH4 deficiency is a more severe disease involving progressive neurologic deterioration. Based on the biological findings, HPA is defined as a plasma phenylalanine level of >2.0 mg/dl (>120 μmol/l). The National Biochemistry Reference Laboratory at the Pasteur Institute of Iran initiated BH4 deficiency screening tests for the first time during the implementation of a nationwide phenylketonuria (PKU) screening program. Measurement of blood phenylalanine and urinary neopterin and biopterin was conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography in 617 patients with HPA. Dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity was measured in all patients by kinetic spectrophotometry. Differential diagnosis was conducted for PKU, transient HPA, and BH4 deficiencies.Our results indicated that out of 76 cases involving BH4 deficiencies, 37 had 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) deficiency, 35 had DHPR deficiency, 1 case had pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) deficiency, and 3 cases had GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) deficiency. In this study, 1 novel deletion mutation and 18 novel missense mutations were reported in addition to mutations that had previously been identified and registered in BIOMDB. At present, the screening program for PKU in Iran includes tests that detect different forms of BH4 deficiency presenting with HPA.

Some uremic toxins are ingested with the diet, such as phosphate and star fruit-derived caramboxin. Others result from nutrient processing by gut microbiota, yielding precursors of uremic toxins or uremic toxins themselves. These nutrients include l-carnitine, choline/phosphatidylcholine, tryptophan and tyrosine, which are also sold over-the-counter as nutritional supplements. Physicians and patients alike should be aware that, in CKD patients, the use of these supplements may lead to potentially toxic effects. Unfortunately, most patients with CKD are not aware of their condition. Some of the dietary components may modify the gut microbiota, increasing the number of bacteria that process them to yield uremic toxins, such as trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO), p-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl sulfate and indole-3 acetic acid.

In recent years, China healthcare policy makers and patients have become increasingly concerned about orphan drug issues. However, very few studies have assessed the availability and affordability of orphan drugs for rare diseases in China. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the availability and affordability of orphan drugs in China and to make suggestions to improve patient access to orphan drugs.MethodsTwo components of the availability of orphan drugs were examined. Market availability was assessed by the extent to which orphan drugs were marketed in China with a comparison to orphan drugs in international markets, such as the U.S., EU and Japan. We conducted surveys and collected data from 24 tertiary public hospitals in China to measure hospital-level availability of orphan drugs. The affordability of orphan drugs was calculated using hospital dispensary prices and was expressed as days of average daily income required for the cost of a course of treatment. Affordability was also analyzed under the Chinese basic medical insurance system.ResultsOrphan drugs approved in the U.S., EU and Japan had 37.8 %, 24.6 % and 52.4 % market availability in China, respectively. Median availability of 31 orphan drugs surveyed at the 24 tertiary public hospitals was 20.8 % (very low). Within a periodic treatment course, the average treatment cost of 23 orphan drugs is approximately 4, 843. 5 USD, which equates to 505.6 days of per capita net income for an urban resident with a middle income (187.4 days for a high-income urban resident) or 1,582.8 days’s income for a rural resident with a middle income (657.2 days for a high-income rural resident). Except for homoharringtonine, 22 orphan drugs for 14 rare diseases were unaffordable for the most of residents in China. With 5 % out-of-pocket expenses, only three generics could be afforded by middle-income residents, whereas seven drugs for high-income urban residents.ConclusionsThe Chinese government can take more responsibility for improving the availability and affordability of orphan drugs through setting up incentive policies and public platforms for sharing of orphan drug information. Control of the high price of orphan drugs, combined with a joint funding model from both government and private enterprise can efficiently reduce the economic burden of affected patients in China.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13023-016-0392-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Rare disease, Orphan drug, Availability, Price, Affordability, China",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4769558/,abstract

This article reviews high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) as an affordable approach to routinely analyze samples for a broad spectrum of environmental chemicals and biologic responses. HRM has been successfully used in multiple exposome research paradigms and is suitable to implement in a prototype universal exposure surveillance system. Development of such a structure for systematic monitoring of environmental exposures is an important step toward sequencing the exposome because it builds upon successes of exposure science, naturally connects external exposure to body burden and partitions the exposome into workable components. Practical results would be repositories of quantitative data on chemicals according to geography and biology. This would support new opportunities for environmental health analysis and predictive modeling. Complementary approaches to hasten development of exposome theory and associated biologic response networks could include experimental studies with model systems, analysis of archival samples from longitudinal studies with outcome data and study of relatively short-lived animals, such as household pets (dogs and cats) and non-human primates (common marmoset).

Male courtship drive is complex, and is subject to neuromodulatory control. Using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we identified neurons in the brain (inferior posterior slope; IPS) that impact courtship drive, and were controlled by tyramine—a biogenic amine related to dopamine, whose roles in most animals are enigmatic. We knocked out a tyramine-specific receptor, TyrR, which was expressed in IPS neurons. Loss of TyrR led to a striking elevation in courtship activity between males. This effect occurred only in the absence of females, as the TyrRGal4 mutant males exhibited a wild-type preference for females. Artificial hyperactivation of IPS neurons caused a large increase in male-male courtship, while suppression of IPS activity decreased male-female courtship. We conclude that TyrR is a receptor for tyramine, and suggest that it serves to curb high levels of courtship activity through functioning as an inhibitory neuromodulator.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5021585/,abstract

In order to further its therapeutic potential, a dairy Lactococcus lactis strain was engineered to express murine IL-35 (LL-IL35), and this recombinant strain was applied to suppress collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Oral administration of LL-IL35 effectively reduced the incidence and disease severity of CIA. When administered therapeutically, LL-IL35 abruptly halted CIA progression with no increase in disease severity by reducing neutrophil influx into the joints. LL-IL35 treatment reduced IFN-γ and IL-17 3.7- and 8.5-fold, respectively, and increased IL-10 production compared to diseased mice. Foxp3+ and Foxp3− CD39+ CD4+ T cells were previously shown to be the Tregs responsible for conferring protection against CIA. Inquiry into their induction revealed that both CCR6+ and CCR6− Foxp3+or− CD39+ CD4+ T cells act as the source of the IL-10 induced by LL-IL35. Thus, this study demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of engineered probiotics for treating autoimmune diseases.Keywords: Lactococcus, probiotic, IL-35, therapeutic, IL-10, cytokines, regulatory T cells, CCR6",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6255909/,abstract

It is transmitted as an autosomal recessive disease and is typically characterized by neonatal galactose intolerance, with complications ranging from neonatal jaundice and liver failure to late complications, such as motor and reproductive dysfunctions. Galactosemia is also heterogeneous from a molecular standpoint, with hundreds of different mutations described in the GALT gene, some of them specific to certain populations, reflecting consequence of founder effect.MethodsThis study reviews the main clinical findings and depicts the spectrum of mutations identified in 19 patients with CG, six with Duarte Galactosemia and one with type 2 Galactosemia in Brazil. Some individuals were diagnosed through expanded newborn screening test, which is not available routinely to all newborns.ResultsThe main classical Galactosemia mutations reported to date were identified in this study, as well as the Duarte variant and seven novel mutations - c.2 T > C (p.M1T), c.97C > A (p.R33S), c.217C > T (p.P73S), c.328 + 1G > A (IVS3 + 1G > A), c.377 + 4A > C (IVS4 + 4A > C), c.287_289delACA (p.N97del) and c.506A > C (p.Q169P).

In contrast, untreated or late-treated PKU is known to result in severe intellectual disability, seizures, and behavioral disturbances. Rarely, however, untreated or late-diagnosed PKU patients with high plasma phenylalanine concentrations have been reported to escape from intellectual disability. The present study aimed to review published cases of such PKU patients.MethodsTo this purpose, we conducted a literature search in PubMed and EMBASE up to 8th of September 2017 to identify cases with 1) PKU diagnosis and start of treatment after 7 years of age; 2) untreated plasma phenylalanine concentrations ≥1200 μmol/l; and 3) IQ ≥80. Literature search, checking reference lists, selection of articles, and extraction of data were performed by two independent researchers.ResultsIn total, we identified 59 published cases of patients with late-diagnosed PKU and unexpected favorable outcome who met the inclusion criteria. Although all investigated patients had intellectual functioning within the normal range, at least 19 showed other neurological, psychological, and/or behavioral symptoms.ConclusionsBased on the present findings, the classical symptomatology of untreated or late-treated PKU may need to be rewritten, not only in the sense that intellectual dysfunction is not obligatory, but also in the sense that intellectual functioning does not (re)present the full picture of brain damage due to high plasma phenylalanine concentrations.

Background and study aims 
Quality of inspection during colonoscopy is strictly related to the level of cleansing. High-volume (PEG-based) solutions are highly effective and safe, but their high volume affects tolerability and compliance. The aim of this study was to compare a new low-volume PEG with citrate and simethicone solution (PMF 104,Clensia) with a low-volume PEG with ascorbic acid solution (PEG-ASC; Moviprep).

Patients and methods
 This was a multicenter, randomized, observer-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 clinical trial, where patients were randomized between PMF 104 and PEG-ASC. In both groups, patients were instructed to take a full-dose regimen the evening before if colonoscopy was scheduled before 11 am to 12 pm, or to take a split regimen if colonoscopy was scheduled after 11 am to 12 pm. The primary end-point was an equivalence between PMF104 and PEG-ASC in the rate of adequate level of cleansing (Ottawa scale ≤ 6), with safety, mucosal visibility, tolerability, acceptance and compliance being also assessed.

Results 
Of the 403 enrolled, 367 patients (Mean age [SD]: 55.6 (14.4) years; male:166 [45.2 %]) were included in the per protocol (PP) analysis: 184 being randomized in the PMF 104 group and 183 in the PEG-ASC group. Successful bowel cleansing was 78.3 % and 74.3 % in PMF104 and in PEG-ASC, respectively (
P
 = 0.37). Both preparations were equally safe (mild adverse events were observed in 9.2 % and 9.3 % of patients in the PMF104 and in the PEG-ASC group, respectively) and acceptable (no or mild distress during the intake in 81.4 % and 80.8 % in the PMF104 in the PEG-ASC, respectively [
P
 = 0.74]).

Conclusion 
The new low-volume product Clensia is equivalent to the reference low-volume PEG-ASC in terms of bowel cleansing, safety and acceptance.

Recent clinical findings have suggested new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of obesity, using personalized dietary approaches. Precision nutrition (PN), also called personalized nutrition, has been developed to deliver more preventive and practical dietary advice than ‘one-size-fits-all’ guidelines. With interventions becoming increasingly plausible at a large scale thanks to artificial intelligence and smartphone applications, some have begun to view PN as a novel way to deliver the right dietary intervention to the right population. We argue that large-scale PN, if taken alone, might be of limited interest from a public health perspective. Building on Geoffrey Rose’s theory regarding the differences in individual and population causes of disease, we show that large-scale PN can only address some individual causes of obesity (causes of cases). This individual-centred approach is likely to have a small impact on the distribution of obesity at a population level because it ignores the population causes of obesity (causes of incidence). The latter are embedded in the populations’ social, cultural, economic and political contexts that make environments obesogenic. Additionally, the most socially privileged groups in the population are the most likely to respond to large-scale PN interventions. This could have the undesirable effect of widening social inequalities in obesity. We caution public health actors that interventions based only on large-scale PN are unlikely, despite current expectations, to improve dietary intake or reduce obesity at a population level.Keywords: Precision nutrition, personalized nutrition, obesity, population interventions, social inequalities in health, obesogenic environments",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469305/,abstract

However, controlled studies have demonstrated antidepressant activity for high doses of oral selegiline and for transdermal selegiline suggesting that when plasma levels of selegiline are elevated, brain MAO-A might also be inhibited. Zydis selegiline (Zelapar) is an orally disintegrating formulation of selegiline, which is absorbed through the buccal mucosa producing higher plasma levels of selegiline and reduced amphetamine metabolites compared with equal doses of conventional selegiline. Although there is indirect evidence that Zydis selegiline at high doses loses its selectivity for MAO-B, there is no direct evidence that it also inhibits brain MAO-A in humans. We measured brain MAO-A in 18 healthy men after a 28-day treatment with Zydis selegiline (2.5, 5.0, or 10 mg/day) and in 3 subjects receiving the selegiline transdermal system (Emsam patch, 6 mg/day) using positron emission tomography and the MAO-A radiotracer [11C]clorgyline.

constitute the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism, and is most
often caused by defects in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) function resulting in
accumulation of Phe to neurotoxic levels. Despite the success of dietary
intervention in preventing permanent neurological damage, individuals living
with PKU clamor for additional non-dietary therapies. The bulk of
disease-associated mutations are PAH missense variants, which occur throughout
the entire 452 amino acid human PAH protein. While some disease-associated
mutations affect protein structure (e.g. truncations) and others encode
catalytically dead variants, most have been viewed as defective in protein
folding/stability. Here we refine this view to address how PKU-associated
missense variants can perturb the equilibrium among alternate native PAH
structures (resting-state PAH and activated PAH), thus shifting the tipping
point of this equilibrium to a neurotoxic Phe concentration. This refined view
of PKU introduces opportunities for the design or discovery of therapeutic
pharmacological chaperones that can help restore the tipping point to healthy
Phe levels and how such a therapeutic might work with or without the inhibitory
pharmacological chaperone BH4. Dysregulation of an equilibrium of
architecturally distinct native PAH structures departs from the
concept of “misfolding”, provides an updated understanding of
PKU, and presents an enhanced foundation for understanding genotype/phenotype

This review focuses on specific alterations of gut microbiota mostly observed in autistic patients. Particularly, the mechanisms through which such alterations may trigger the production of the bacterial metabolites, or leaky gut in autistic people are described. Various altered metabolite levels were observed in the blood and urine of autistic children, many of which were of bacterial origin such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), indoles and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A less integrative gut-blood-barrier is abundant in autistic individuals. This explains the leakage of bacterial metabolites into the patients, triggering new body responses or an altered metabolism. Some other co-occurring symptoms such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress in cells, altered tight junctions in the blood-brain barrier and structural changes in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum were also detected. Moreover, this paper suggests that ASD is associated with an unbalanced gut microbiota (dysbiosis). Although the cause-effect relationship between ASD and gut microbiota is not yet well established, the consumption of specific probiotics may represent a side-effect free tool to re-establish gut homeostasis and promote gut health.

Consanguineous marriage was detected in the family history of 7 patients. One patient had a history of a deceased sibling with a confirmed diagnosis of galactosemia. The main reasons for admission to the hospital were jaundice in 9, hypoglycemia in 2, sepsis in 2, and elevated liver enzymes in 1 patient. The Beutler test was positive in all patients. The mean enzyme activity was 0.36±0.26 μmol/mL. Only 6 of our cases were diagnosed in the early period (first 15 days). Cataract was present in four patients. Q188R mutation was observed in 13 patients, and homozygote N314D and homozygote E340X mutations were observed in one patient. Three patients had impaired neurologic development according to the Denver Developmental Screening Test II.ConclusionThe most common genetic abnormality was Q188R mutation. Only 43% of our patients’s disease could be diagnosed at an early stage. We suggest that galactosemia should be included in the national newborn screening program in order to make earlier diagnoses.Keywords: Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency, galactosemia, newborn screening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5242248/,abstract

Conditions on the Health and Human Services Secretary’s Recommended Uniform Screening Panel have been adopted by most state NBS programs, providing a consistent approach for identification of affected newborns across the United States. Screen-positive newborns are identified and referred for confirmatory diagnosis and follow-up. The designation of a clinically significant phenotype precursor to a clinical diagnosis may vary between clinical specialists, resulting in diagnostic variation. Determination of disease burden and birth prevalence of the screened conditions by public health tracking is made challenging by these variations. This report describes the development of a core group of new case definitions, along with implications, plans for their use, and links to the definitions that were developed by panels of clinical experts. These definitions have been developed through an iterative process and are piloted in NBS programs. Consensus public health surveillance case definitions for newborn screened disorders will allow for consistent categorization and tracking of short- and long-term follow-up of identified newborns at the local, regional, and national levels.Keywords: newborn screening, case definitions, short-term follow up, public health surveillance",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5978752/,abstract

We sought to assess the feasibility of further improving the screening using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology.MethodsAn NGS assay was used to detect 162 CFTR mutations/variants characterized by the CFTR2 project. We used 67 dried blood spots (DBSs) containing 48 distinct CFTR mutations to validate the assay. NGS assay was retrospectively performed on 165 CF screen–positive samples with one CFTR mutation.ResultsThe NGS assay was successfully performed using DNA isolated from DBSs, and it correctly detected all CFTR mutations in the validation. Among 165 screen-positive infants with one CFTR mutation, no additional disease-causing mutation was identified in 151 samples consistent with normal sweat tests. Five infants had a CF-causing mutation that was not included in this panel, and nine with two CF-causing mutations were identified.ConclusionThe NGS assay was 100% concordant with traditional methods. Retrospective analysis results indicate an IRT/NGS screening algorithm would enable high sensitivity, better specificity and positive predictive value (PPV).

Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) is a liver-enriched transcription factor that plays a key role in hepatocyte function. Our previous study revealed a significant inhibitory effect of HNF1α on hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we report that the expression of HNF1α is significantly repressed in both human and rat fibrotic liver. Knockdown of HNF1α in the liver significantly aggravates hepatic fibrogenesis in either dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) or bile duct ligation (BDL) model in rats. In contrast, forced expression of HNF1α markedly alleviates hepatic fibrosis. HNF1α regulates the transcriptional expression of SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) via directly binding to SHP-1 promoter in hepatocytes. Inhibition of SHP-1 expression abrogates the anti-fibrotic effect of HNF1α in DMN-treated rats. Moreover, HNF1α repression in primary hepatocytes leads to the activation of NF-κB and JAK/STAT pathways and initiates an inflammatory feedback circuit consisting of HNF1α, SHP-1, STAT3, p65, miR-21 and miR-146a, which sustains the deregulation of HNF1α in hepatocytes. More interestingly, a coordinated crosstalk between hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) participates in this positive feedback circuit and facilitates the progression of hepatocellular damage. Our findings demonstrate that impaired hepatocytes play an active role in hepatic fibrogenesis. Early intervention of HNF1α-regulated inflammatory feedback loop in hepatocytes may have beneficial effects in the treatment of chronic liver diseases.Keywords: Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α, liver fibrosis, SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-1, microRNA, feedback, crosstalk",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4528057/,abstract

This observational study evaluated QoL in a cohort of PKU patients, using updated and detailed instruments.Methods22 patients with mild PKU respondent to BH4 and 21 patients with classical PKU treated with diet were recruited in this study. Adult patients completed WHOQOL questionnaire-100 (WHOQOL-100) and pediatric patients the Pediatric QoL inventory (PedsQLTM). Psychiatric and mood disorders were also evaluated using TAD or BDI and STAI-Y inventories. A multivariable linear regression model was fitted to investigate the predictors of QoL, including age, sex, treatment type, length of current treatment, educational level and employment status (only for adults) as covariates. Results were presented as regression coefficients with 95% confidence interval.ResultsGlobal QoL scores were within normal range both in patients with mild and classical disease but global QoL scores were significantly higher in patients with mild PKU under BH4 treatment as compared to those affected by classical disease who were under diet regimen. Furthermore, QoL significantly increased in long treated PKU patients. Among adult patients, QoL scores were significantly lower in males, in patients with lower education and in those employed or unemployed as compared to students (baseline).ConclusionsBoth diet and medical treatment based upon BH4 seem to be associated with higher QoL in the long run. However, patients with mild PKU can rely on BH4 to achieve a higher Phe tolerance and a better compliance to therapy due to diet relaxation/avoidance. Some specific categories of patients with a lower QoL should be investigated more in depth, engaging with those at risk of lower treatment compliance.

In different disease models and targeting distinct organs, it has been demonstrated to revert the pathologic symptoms and signs. The therapeutic potential of hydrofection led different groups to work on the clinical translation of the procedure. In order to prevent the hemodynamic side effects derived from the rapid injection of a large volume, the conditions had to be moderated to make them compatible with its use in mid-size animal models such as rat, hamster and rabbit and large animals as dog, pig and primates. Despite the different approaches performed to adapt the conditions of gene delivery, the results obtained in any of these mid-size and large animals have been poorer than those obtained in murine model. Among these different strategies to reduce the volume employed, the most effective one has been to exclude the vasculature of the target organ and inject the solution directly. This procedure has permitted, by catheterization and surgical procedures in large animals, achieving protein expression levels in tissue close to those achieved in gold standard models. These promising results and the possibility of employing these strategies to transfer gene constructs able to edit genes, such as CRISPR, have renewed the clinical interest of this procedure of gene transfer. In order to translate the hydrodynamic gene delivery to human use, it is demanding the standardization of the procedure conditions and the molecular parameters of evaluation in order to be able to compare the results and establish a homogeneous manner of expressing the data obtained, as ‘classic’ drugs.Keywords: hydrodynamic, gene therapy, non-viral, translational",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5867857/,abstract

The correction of missplicing is a potential therapeutic target.ObjectiveTo determine the prevalence, genetic origin, and molecular mechanism of a donor c.828+3A>T mutation in the PRPH2 (peripherin 2, retinal degeneration slow) gene in individuals with retinal dystrophies.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsCase-control study that took place at the University of Texas Health Science Center, the University of Iowa, and the Retina Foundation of the Southwest, from January 1, 1987, to August 1, 2014, including affected individuals from 200 families with a diagnosis of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, 35 families with unspecified macular dystrophies, and 116 families with pattern dystrophy. Participants were screened for the c.828+3A>T mutation by restriction-enzyme digest, single-strand conformational polymorphism screening, or bidirectional sequencing. Haplotypes of polymorphic markers flanking the PRPH2 locus and sequence variants within the gene were determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis or automated capillary-based cycle sequencing. The effect of the splice site mutation on the PRPH2 transcript was analyzed using NetGene2, a splice prediction program and by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of illegitimate transcripts from peripheral white blood cells.Main Outcomes and MeasuresResults of testing for splice site mutation, haplotypes, and alternate transcripts.ResultsThe PRPH2 mutation was found in 97 individuals of 19 independently ascertained families with a clinical diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa, macular dystrophy, and/or pattern dystrophy. All affected individuals also shared a rare haplotype of approximately 644 kilobase pairs containing the c.828+3A>T mutation, which extends from the short tandem repeat polymorphism D6S282 to c.1013G>A (rs434102, a single-nucleotide polymorphism) in exon 3 of PRPH2, suggesting this mutation is from a common ancestor and is a founder mutation. It has a prevalence of 2% in families diagnosed as having autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and 10% in families with variable clinical diagnosis of pattern, macular, and retinal dystrophies. Individuals with the c.828+3A>T mutation expressed a PRPH2 transcript not found in control participants and that was consistent with abnormal splicing.Conclusions and RelevanceThe PRPH2 c.828+3A>T splice site mutation is a frequent cause of inherited retinal dystrophies and is owing to the founder effect. The likely cause of disease is the missplicing of the PRPH2 message that results in a truncated protein product.

The cblA type of MMA is very rare in China. This study aimed to describe the biochemical, clinical, and genetic characteristics of two siblings in a Chinese family, suspected of having the cblA-type of MMA.MethodsThe Chinese family of Han ethnicity of two siblings with the cblA-type of MMA, was enrolled. Target-exome sequencing was performed for a panel of MMA-related genes to detect causative mutations. The influence of an identified missense variant on the protein’s structure and function was analysed using SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PROVEAN, and MutationTaster software. Moreover, homology modelling of the human wild-type and mutant proteins was performed using SWISSMODEL to evaluate the variant.ResultsThe proband was identified via newborn screening (NBS); whereas, her elder brother, who had not undergone expanded NBS, was diagnosed later through genetic family screening. The younger sibling exhibited abnormal biochemical manifestations, and the clinical performance was relatively good after treatment, while the older brother had a mild biochemical and clinical phenotype, mainly featuring poor academic performance. A novel, homozygous missense c.365T>C variant in exon 2 of their MMAA genes was identified using next-generation sequencing and validated by Sanger sequencing. Several different types of bioinformatics software predicted that the novel variant c.365T>C (p.L122P) was deleterious. Furthermore, three-dimensional crystal structure analysis revealed that replacement of Leu122 with Pro122 led to the loss of two intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the residue at position 122 and Leu188 and Ala119, resulting in instability of the MMAA protein structure.ConclusionsThe two siblings suspected of having the cblA-type of MMA showed mild phenotypes during follow-up, and a novel, homozygous missense variant in their MMAA genes was identified. We believe that the clinical features of the two siblings were associated with the MMAA c.365T>C variant; however, further functional studies are warranted to confirm the variant’s pathogenicity.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12881-018-0635-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Isolated methylmalonic aciduria, Novel variant, MMAA gene, Next-generation sequencing",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6042273/,abstract

In our study, 50 fasted participants engaged in a temporal persistence task, incentivised with monetary rewards. In alternating blocks of this task, rewards were delivered at delays drawn randomly from distributions with either a lower or higher maximum reward rate. During some blocks participants received either a caloric drink or water. We used survival analysis to estimate participants' probability of quitting conditional on the delay distribution and the consumed liquid. Participants had a higher probability of quitting in blocks with the higher reward rate. Furthermore, participants who consumed the caloric drink had a higher probability of quitting than those who consumed water.

However, patients have to follow a diet restricted in several natural components, what may cause decreased bone density and obesity. Exercise is known to improve both mental functioning and bone density also avoiding obesity, and could optimize aspects of central and peripheral outcome, regardless changes in phenylalanine (Phe) levels. However, the acute effects of exercise on metabolic parameters in phenylketonuria patients are unknown and thereby long-term adaptations are unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate patients' basal metabolic rate (BMR), and their acute response to an aerobic exercise session on plasma concentrations of Phe, tyrosine (Tyr), and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), as well as metabolic and hormonal responses.MethodsFive early- and four late diagnosed phenylketonuria patients aged 21 ± 4 years and 17 sex-, age-, and BMI-matched controls were evaluated for BMR, peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and plasma amino acid, glucose, lipid profile and hormonal levels. At least one week later, participants performed a 30-min aerobic exercise session (intensities individually calculated using the VO2peak results). Blood samples were collected in fasted state (moment 1, M1) and immediately after a small breakfast, which included the metabolic formula for patients but not for controls, and the exercise session (moment 2, M2).ResultsPhenylketonuria patients and controls showed similar BMR and physical capacities. At M1, patients presented higher Phe concentration and Phe/Tyr ratio; and lower levels of BCAA and total cholesterol than controls. Besides that, poorly controlled patients tended to stay slightly below the prescribed VO2 during exercise. Both patients and controls showed increased levels of total cholesterol and LDL at M2 compared with M1. Only controls showed increased levels of Tyr, lactate, and HDL; and decreased Phe/Tyr ratio and glucose levels at M2 compared to values at M1.ConclusionsAcute aerobic exercise followed by a Phe-restricted breakfast did not change Phe concentrations in treated phenylketonuria patients, but it was associated with decreased Phe/Tyr only in controls. Further studies are necessary to confirm our results in a higher number of patients.Abbreviations: BCAA, branched-chain amino acids; BMI, body mass index; BMR, basal metabolic rate; CTL, control; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; N/A, not applicable; NS, non-significant; Phe, phenylalanine; PKU, phenylketonuria; RER, respiratory exchange ratio; Tyr, tyrosine; VCO2, carbon dioxide production; VO2, oxygen consumption; VO2peak, peak oxygen consumptionKeywords: Phenylketonuria, PKU, Aerobic exercise, Basal metabolic rate, Phenylalanine, Natural restricted diet",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5471389/,abstract

We investigated the putative teratogenicity of SSRI prescription in the 91 days either side of first day of last menstrual period (LMP).Methods and FindingsThree population-based EUROCAT congenital anomaly registries- Norway (2004–2010), Wales (2000–2010) and Funen, Denmark (2000–2010)—were linked to the electronic healthcare databases holding prospectively collected prescription information for all pregnancies in the timeframes available. We included 519,117 deliveries, including foetuses terminated for congenital anomalies, with data covering pregnancy and the preceding quarter, including 462,641 with data covering pregnancy and one year either side. For SSRI exposures 91 days either side of LMP, separately and together, odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (ORs, 95%CI) for all major anomalies were estimated. We also explored: pausing or discontinuing SSRIs preconception, confounding, high dose regimens, and, in Wales, diagnosis of depression. Results were combined in meta-analyses. SSRI prescription 91 days either side of LMP was associated with increased prevalence of severe congenital heart defects (CHD) (as defined by EUROCAT guide 1.3, 2005) (34/12,962 [0.26%] vs. 865/506,155 [0.17%] OR 1.50, 1.06–2.11), and the composite adverse outcome of 'anomaly or stillbirth' (473/12962, 3.65% vs. 15829/506,155, 3.13%, OR 1.13, 1.03–1.24). The increased prevalence of all major anomalies combined did not reach statistical significance (3.09% [400/12,962] vs. 2.67% [13,536/506,155] OR 1.09, 0.99–1.21). Adjusting for socio-economic status left ORs largely unchanged. The prevalence of anomalies and severe CHD was reduced when SSRI prescriptions were stopped or paused preconception, and increased when >1 prescription was recorded, but differences were not statistically significant. The dose-response relationship between severe CHD and SSRI dose (meta-regression OR 1.49, 1.12–1.97) was consistent with SSRI-exposure related risk. Analyses in Wales suggested no associations between anomalies and diagnosed depression.ConclusionThe additional absolute risk of teratogenesis associated with SSRIs, if causal, is small.

This disorder is characterized by increased activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is involved in regulating ribosomal biogenesis and translation initiation. We measured the effects of Tsc2 haploinsufficiency (Tsc2+/−) in three month old male mice on regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) by means of the in vivo L-[1-14C]leucine method. This quantitative autoradiographic method includes an estimate of the integrated specific activity of the tracer amino acid in brain tissue. The estimate accounts for recycling of unlabeled amino acids from tissue protein breakdown by means of a factor (λ) that was determined in control and Tsc2+/− mice. The value of λ was higher in Tsc2+/− mice, indicating that a greater fraction of leucine in the tissue precursor pool for protein synthesis is derived from the plasma compared to controls, consistent with reduced rates of protein degradation. We determined rCPS in freely-moving, awake male Tsc2+/− and control mice, and we used the determined values of λ in the calculation of rCPS. Unexpectedly, we found that rCPS were significantly decreased in 16 of the 17 brain regions analyzed in Tsc2+/− mice compared to controls.

In this study, free fatty acid- (FFA-) induced steatosis of hepatocyte liver cell LO2 was used as an in vitro model. The methods of Oil Red O staining, RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect LO2-regulated HNF1α expression and its effects on FFA-induced LO2 cell steatosis, the insulin signaling and SOCS-3-STAT3 signaling pathways, the expression of lipid metabolism-related regulators, and phosphorylation. With increased FFA induction time, the expression of HNF1α in the LO2 fatty degeneration hepatic cells gradually decreased. Downregulation of HNF1α expression aggravated FFA-induced steatosis of LO2 hepatocytes. HNF1α promotes activation of the insulin pathway and oxidative breakdown of fat and inhibits lipid anabolism. Inhibitors of STAT3 can reverse the regulation of decreased HNF1α expression on the insulin signaling pathway and fat metabolism. We also confirmed this pathway using HNF1α-/- mice combining treatment with STAT3 inhibitor NSC 74859 in vivo.

Accordingly, we prepared different surface-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and investigated the effects of sialic acid on cellular and immune responses of nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Sialic acid modification not only facilitates evasion of the RES by suppressing the immune response, but also enhances tumor accumulation via its active targeting ability.

Taking lung cancer (LC) as an example, this study tried to explore if this technique could be of any assistance for the discovery of tumor metabolite markers.Materials and methodsTwenty-six acylcarnitines and 23 amino acids, which are commonly used in IEM screening, were quantified using DBS samples from 222 LC patients, 118 benign lung disease (LD) patients, and 96 healthy volunteers (CONT). Forty-four calculated ratios based on the abovementioned metabolites were also included using MS/MS quantification results.ResultsThis pilot study led to the findings of 65 significantly changed amino acids, acylcarnitines, and some of their ratios for the LC, LD, and CONT groups. Among the differential parameters, 12 items showed reverse changing trends between the LC and LD groups compared to the CONT group. Regression analysis demonstrated that six of them – Arg, Pro, C10:1, Arg/Orn, Cit/Arg, and C5-OH/C0 – could be used to diagnose LC with a sensitivity of 91.3% and a specificity of 92.7%.ConclusionThis study demonstrated the DBS-based MS/MS strategy was a promising tool for the discovery of tumor metabolite markers.

These deficits are believed to be the result of elevated levels of phenylalanine throughout life. Research on cognitive functioning in adults with PKU (AwPKU) often focuses on domains shown to be compromised in children with PKU, such as attention and executive functions, whereas other cognitive domains have received less attention. This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of cognitive functioning across domains examined in early treated (ET) AwPKU.MethodsA systematic search was performed in Ovid MEDLINE(R), PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase, ScienceDirect, and PubMed for observational studies on cognitive performance in ET AwPKU.ResultsTwenty-two peer-reviewed publications, reporting on outcomes from 16 studies were reviewed. Collectively, the results most consistently showed deficits in vigilance, working memory and motor skills. Deficits in other cognitive domains were less consistently observed or were understudied. Furthermore, despite reports of several associations between cognitive performance and phenylalanine (Phe) levels throughout life the relationship remains unclear. Inconsistencies in findings across studies could be explained by the highly heterogeneous nature of study samples, resulting in large inter- and intra-variability in Phe levels, as well as the use of a variety of tests across cognitive domains, which differ in sensitivity. The long-term cognitive outcomes of early and continuous management of PKU remain unclear.ConclusionsTo better understand the development of cognitive deficits in ET AwPKU, future research would benefit from 1) (inter)national multicentre-studies; 2) more homogeneous study samples; 3) the inclusion of other nutritional measures that might influence cognitive functioning (e.g. Phe fluctuations, Phe:Tyrosine ratio and micronutrients such as vitamin B12); and 4) careful selection of appropriate cognitive tests.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13023-018-0893-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, Cognitive function, Attention, Processing speed, Executive function, Motor skills",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6117942/,abstract

When we amplified Polι mRNA from 129/SvJ or 129/Ola testes, only a small fraction of the full-length cDNA contained the nonsense mutation; the major fraction corresponded to a variant Polι isoform lacking exon 2. Polι mRNA lacking exon 2 contains an open reading frame, and the corresponding protein was detected using a polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of the murine Polι protein. The identity of the corresponding protein was further confirmed by mass spectrometry. Although the variant protein was expressed at only 5 to 10% of the level of wild-type Polι, it retained de novo DNA synthesis activity, the capacity to form replication foci following UV irradiation, and the ability to rescue UV light sensitivity in Polι−/− embryonic fibroblasts derived from a new, fully deficient Polι knockout (KO) mouse line. Furthermore, in vivo treatment of 129-derived male mice with Velcade, a drug that inhibits proteasome function, stabilized and restored a substantial amount of the variant Polι in these animals, indicating that its turnover is controlled by the proteasome. An analysis of two xeroderma pigmentosum-variant (XPV) cases corresponding to missense mutants of Polη, a related translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase in the same family, similarly showed a destabilization of the catalytically active mutant protein by the proteasome.

A total of 1091 infants aged 6–12 months together with their parents/caregivers living at Heping Avenue Subdistrict of Beijing were surveyed from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2014.Results:The prevalence of anemia was 12.60% with a range of 3.47%–40.00% in different subgroup characteristics. The CHAID decision tree model has demonstrated multilevel interaction among risk factors through stepwise pathways to detect anemia. Besides the three predictors identified by logistic regression model including maternal anemia during pregnancy, exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months, and floating population, CHAID decision tree analysis also identified the fourth risk factor, the maternal educational level, with higher overall classification accuracy and larger area below the receiver operating characteristic curve.Conclusions:The infant anemic status in metropolis is complex and should be carefully considered by the basic health care practitioners.

In the case of resistance to the anti-malarial drug chloroquine (CQ), a specific mutation in the transporter pfcrt is associated with resistance. Here, we apply a series of analytical steps to gene expression data from our lab and leverage 3 independent datasets to identify pfcrt-interacting genes. Resulting networks provide insights into pfcrt’s biological functions and regulation, as well as the divergent phenotypic effects of its allelic variants in different genetic backgrounds.ResultsTo identify pfcrt-interacting genes, we analyze pfcrt co-expression networks in 2 phenotypic states - CQ-resistant (CQR) and CQ-sensitive (CQS) recombinant progeny clones - using a computational approach that prioritizes gene interactions into functional and regulatory relationships. For both phenotypic states, pfcrt co-expressed gene sets are associated with hemoglobin metabolism, consistent with CQ’s expected mode of action. To predict the drivers of co-expression divergence, we integrate topological relationships in the co-expression networks with available high confidence protein-protein interaction data. This analysis identifies 3 transcriptional regulators from the ApiAP2 family and histone acetylation as potential mediators of these divergences. We validate the predicted divergences in DNA mismatch repair and histone acetylation by measuring the effects of small molecule inhibitors in recombinant progeny clones combined with quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping.ConclusionsThis work demonstrates the utility of differential co-expression viewed in a network framework to uncover functional and regulatory divergence in phenotypically distinct parasites. pfcrt-associated co-expression in the CQ resistant progeny highlights CQR-specific gene relationships and possible targeted intervention strategies.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of endogenous, small, noncoding single-stranded RNAs that act as post-transcriptional gene regulatory elements. MiRNA polymorphisms may be associated with susceptibility to congenital heart disease (CHD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of miRNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on CHD susceptibility.
Methods
We genotyped two functional SNPs, miR-196a2 rs11614913 and miR-146a rs2910164, in a case-control cohort of 173 Chinese patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and 207 non-CHD controls.
Results
When the miR-196a2 rs11614913 TT homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, the TC genotype was not associated with an increased risk of TOF. The CC genotype was associated with a borderline significantly increased risk for TOF. In the recessive model, when the miR-196a2 rs11614913 TT/TC genotypes were used as the reference group, the CC homozygote genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of TOF (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.18-3.25, p = 0.01). The miR-146a rs2910164 C>G polymorphism was not associated with developing TOF.
Conclusions
Our findings suggested that the miR-196a2 rs11614913 T>C polymorphism may play a role in the development of TOF. Future larger studies that include populations of other ethnicities are required to confirm these findings.

However, nicotine failed to produce main effects on OST performance or on alternative measures of working memory (digit span, spatial span, letter-number sequencing, 2-back) or attention (digits forward, 0-back). Interestingly, enhancement of RVIP performance occurred concomitant to significant reductions in self-reported attention/concentration. Human OST performance was significantly related to N-back performance and, as in rodents, OST accuracy declined with increasing memory load.ConclusionsGiven the similarity of human and rodent OST performance under baseline conditions and the strong association between OST and visual 0-back accuracy, the OST may be particular useful in the study of conditions characterized by inattention.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5772879/,abstract

In NF1-patients, whole-brain (MD: r = .646 and DA: r = .673) and ATR- (r-range: −.405–.771), but not the CB- (r-range: −.307–.472) and SLF- (r-range: −.187–.406) white matter integrity, were correlated with inhibitory control. Verbal and performance abilities were not associated with white matter pathology. In NF1, white matter abnormalities are observed throughout the brain, but damage to the ATR seems specifically, or at least most strongly related to inhibitory control. Future studies should examine whether reduced white matter integrity in other brain regions or tracts is (more strongly) associated with different aspects of the cognitive-behavioral phenotype associated with NF1.Keywords: Neurofibromatosis type I, DTI, Anterior thalamic radiation, Executive functions",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5707233/,abstract

The aim of this study was to describe CF patients with the V232D mutation. We identify CF children with the V232D mutation detected by NBS and compare them with CF adults with this mutation whose diagnosis was prompted by clinical symptoms in the same period. We studied clinical, biochemical, spirometric, and prognostic features in both populations. NBS program tested 276,523 children during a period of 14 years (2003–2017) and identified 54 cases of CF. Six children (11%) had the V232D mutation. Over the same period, 5 adults (age 37.6 ± 16.29 years old) with symptoms of CF and this mutation were also diagnosed. Follow-up duration was mean 10.1 years for adults and mean 6.5 years for children. In the adult group, lung function was impaired at diagnosis in all patients (Forced Expiratory Volume1—FEV1—67.12% ± 13.09) and worsened in children tested during evolution (FEV1first: 113%; FEV1last: 64%). Pancreatic insufficiency was present in adult group, with recurrent pancreatitis in 1 present. Although with less clinical expression in children, V232D is associated with pulmonary and pancreatic involvement during adulthood and CF cannot be considered mild. This mutation is present in 11% of all patients diagnosed with CF in our region. Its inclusion in some NBS programs should be taken into account in order to improve the prognosis of affected children.Keywords: CFTR, genetic testing, lung function, newborn screening, pancreatic insufficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6076148/,abstract

Ninety-six young adults (38 depressed, 58 non-depressed) completed the ‘Reading the Mind in the Eyes task’ and a non-mentalistic control task. Genetic associations were only found for the depressed group. Specifically, superior accuracy in decoding mental states of a positive valence was seen in those homozygous for the long allele of the serotonin transporter gene, 9-allele carriers of DAT1, and long-allele carriers of DRD4. In contrast, superior accuracy in decoding mental states of a negative valence was seen in short-allele carriers of the serotonin transporter gene and 10/10 homozygotes of DAT1.

The incidence of IEMs was 1/1178 in Jining, while methylmalonic acidemia, phenylketonuria, and primary carnitine deficiency ranked the top 3 of all detected IEMs. Thirty mutations in nine IEMs-associated genes were identified in 28 confirmed cases. As 19 cases with the mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), solute carrier family 22 member 5 (SLC22A5), and methylmalonic aciduria (cobalamin deficiency) cblC type with homocystinuria (MMACHC) genes, respectively, it suggested that mutations in the PAH, SLC22A5, and MMACHC genes are the predominant causes of IEMs, leading to the high incidence of phenylketonuria, primary carnitine deficiency, and methylmalonic acidemia, respectively. Our work indicated that the overall incidence of IEMs is high and the mutations in PAH, SLC22A5, and MMACHC genes are the leading causes of IEMs in Jining area.

Aim: To compare the measurement of total body water (TBW) and fat-free mass (FFM) using the criterion method of deuterium dilution space (2H2O) with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) using a portable QuadScan 4000, Bodystat® in children and adolescents with phenylketonuria (PKU).
Methods: Sixteen patients with PKU, median age is 12.5 (range 5–20.6) years, were recruited into this cross-sectional study. TBW was measured by both deuterium dilution and BIA on the same occasion as per a standard protocol. FFM was estimated from predictive equations.
Results: There was no significant difference between TBWDeut and TBWBIA (p = 0.344) or FFMDeut and FFMBIA (p = 0.111). TBWDeut and TBWBIA were highly correlated (r = 0.990, p < 0.0001), as were FFMDeut and FFMBIA (r = 0.984, p < 0.0001).

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with abnormalities in dopamine neurotransmission and deficits in reward processing and its underlying neuro-circuitry including the ventral striatum. The microbiome might contribute to ADHD etiology via the gut-brain axis. In this pilot study, we investigated potential differences in the microbiome between ADHD cases and undiagnosed controls, as well as its relation to neural reward processing.MethodsWe used 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing (16S) to identify bacterial taxa and their predicted gene functions in 19 ADHD and 77 control participants. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we interrogated the effect of observed microbiome differences in neural reward responses in a subset of 28 participants, independent of diagnosis.ResultsFor the first time, we describe gut microbial makeup of adolescents and adults diagnosed with ADHD. We found that the relative abundance of several bacterial taxa differed between cases and controls, albeit marginally significant. A nominal increase in the Bifidobacterium genus was observed in ADHD cases. In a hypothesis-driven approach, we found that the observed increase was linked to significantly enhanced 16S-based predicted bacterial gene functionality encoding cyclohexadienyl dehydratase in cases relative to controls. This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of phenylalanine, a precursor of dopamine. Increased relative abundance of this functionality was significantly associated with decreased ventral striatal fMRI responses during reward anticipation, independent of ADHD diagnosis and age.ConclusionsOur results show increases in gut microbiome predicted function of dopamine precursor synthesis between ADHD cases and controls. This increase in microbiome function relates to decreased neural responses to reward anticipation.

We explore whether the clustering pattern of rare missense variants (MAF < 0.01) in a protein is associated with mode of inheritance. Mutations in genes associated with autosomal dominant (AD) conditions are known to result in either loss or gain of function, whereas mutations in genes associated with autosomal recessive (AR) conditions invariably result in loss-of-function. Loss-of-function mutations tend to be distributed uniformly along protein sequence, whereas gain-of-function mutations tend to localize to key regions. It has not previously been ascertained whether these patterns hold in general for rare missense mutations. We consider the extent to which rare missense variants are located within annotated protein domains and whether they form clusters, using a new unbiased method called CLUstering by Mutation Position. These approaches quantified a significant difference in clustering between AD and AR diseases. Proteins linked to AD diseases exhibited more clustering of rare missense mutations than those linked to AR diseases (Wilcoxon P = 5.7 × 10−4, permutation P = 8.4 × 10−4). Rare missense mutation in proteins linked to either AD or AR diseases was more clustered than controls (1000G) (Wilcoxon P = 2.8 × 10−15 for AD and P = 4.5 × 10−4 for AR, permutation P = 3.1 × 10−12 for AD and P = 0.03 for AR).

SCFA were determined by gas chromatography, plasma cytokines via a Bio-Plex Pro assay, and splenocyte T cell populations by flow cytometry. Changes in cecal and fecal microbiota are primarily diet dependent.

Newborn bloodspots positive by biochemical testing were analysed by PEARS assay to detect pathogenic mutations relevant to the IEM.ResultsIn initial validation studies of genomic DNA samples, PEARS assay correctly detected 25 known mutations associated with 17 different IEM. Retrospective gene analysis of newborns with clinical phenylketonuria (PKU), identified compound heterozygote phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations in eight of nine samples (89%). Prospective analysis of 211 bloodspots correctly identified the two true PKU samples, yielding positive and negative predictive values of 100%.

Implementation of a patient-centred approach to both clinical research and care settings, has increased the recognition of patient and/or observer reported outcome measures (PROMs or ObsROMs) as informative and reliable tools for HrQoL assessment. Inherited Metabolic Diseases (IMDs) are a group of heterogeneous conditions with phenotypes ranging from mild to severe and mostly lacking effective therapies. Consequently, HrQoL evaluation is particularly relevant.ObjectivesWe aimed to: (1) identify patient and/or caregiver-reported HrQoL instruments used among IMDs; (2) identify the main results of the application of each HrQoL tool and (3) evaluate the main limitations of HrQoL instruments and study design/methodology in IMDs.MethodsA scoping review was conducted using methods outlined by Arksey and O’Malley. Additionally, we critically analysed each article to identify the HrQoL study drawbacks.ResultsOf the 1954 studies identified, 131 addressed HrQoL of IMDs patients using PROMs and/or ObsROMs, both in observational or interventional studies. In total, we identified 32 HrQoL instruments destined to self- or proxy-completion; only 2% were disease-specific. Multiple tools (both generic and disease-specific) proved to be responsive to changes in HrQoL; the SF-36 and PedsQL questionnaires were the most frequently used in the adult and pediatric populations, respectively. Furthermore, proxy data often demonstrated to be a reliable approach complementing self-reported HrQoL scores. Nevertheless, numerous limitations were identified especially due to the rarity of these conditions.ConclusionsHrQoL is still not frequently assessed in IMDs. However, our results show successful examples of the use of patient-reported HrQoL instruments in this field. The importance of HrQoL measurement for clinical research and therapy development, incites to further research in HrQoL PROMs’ and ObsROMs’ creation and validation in IMDs.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13023-018-0953-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), Observer reported outcome measures (ObsROMs), Quality of life (QoL), Health-related quality of life (HrQoL), Inherited metabolic disease(s) (IMD(s))",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6263554/,abstract

In order to address these issues as early as possible, a process called tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) can be used as it allows for rapid and simultaneous detection of the diseases. This analysis was performed to determine whether newborn screening by MS/MS is cost-effective in Thailand.MethodA cost-utility analysis comprising a decision-tree and Markov model was used to estimate the cost in Thai baht (THB) and health outcomes in life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) presented as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The results were also adjusted to international dollars (I$) using purchasing power parities (PPP) (1 I$ = 17.79 THB for the year 2013). The comparisons were between 1) an expanded neonatal screening programme using MS/MS screening for six prioritised diseases: phenylketonuria (PKU); isovaleric acidemia (IVA); methylmalonic acidemia (MMA); propionic acidemia (PA); maple syrup urine disease (MSUD); and multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD); and 2) the current practice that is existing PKU screening. A comparison of the outcome and cost of treatment before and after clinical presentations were also analysed to illustrate the potential benefit of early treatment for affected children. A budget impact analysis was conducted to illustrate the cost of implementing the programme for 10 years.ResultsThe ICER of neonatal screening using MS/MS amounted to 1,043,331 THB per QALY gained (58,647 I$ per QALY gained). The potential benefits of early detection compared with late detection yielded significant results for PKU, IVA, MSUD, and MCD patients. The budget impact analysis indicated that the implementation cost of the programme was expected at approximately 2,700 million THB (152 million I$) over 10 years.ConclusionAt the current ceiling threshold, neonatal screening using MS/MS in the Thai context is not cost-effective. However, the treatment of patients who were detected early for PKU, IVA, MSUD, and MCD, are considered favourable. The budget impact analysis suggests that the implementation of the programme will incur considerable expenses under limited resources. A long-term epidemiological study on the incidence of IEM in Thailand is strongly recommended to ascertain the magnitude of problem.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4530882/,abstract

Objective
Neurometabolic disorders are an important group of diseases that mostly are presented in newborns and infants. Neurological manifestations are the prominent signs and symptoms in this group of diseases. Seizures are a common sign and are often refractory to antiepileptic drugs in untreated neurometabolic patients. The onset of symptoms for neurometabolic disorders appears after an interval of normal or near normal growth and development.Additionally, affected children may fare well until a catabolic crisis occurs. Patients with neurometabolic disorders during metabolic decompensation have severe clinical presentation, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This symptom is often fatal but severe neurological insult and regression in neurodevelopmental milestones can result as a prominent sign in patients who survived. Acute symptoms should be immediately treated regardless of the cause. A number of patients with neurometabolic disorders respond favorably and, in some instances, dramatically respond to treatment. Early detection and early intervention is invaluable in some patients to prevent catabolism and normal or near normal neurodevelopmental milestones. This paper discusses neurometabolic disorders, approaches to this group of diseases (from the view of a pediatric neurologist), clinical and neurological manifestations, neuroimaging and electroencephalography findings, early detection, and early treatment.

Identification of these factors and the proper quantification of their relevance provides insights into human biological and metabolic disease processes, is key for standardized translation of metabolite biomarkers into clinical applications, and is a prerequisite for comparability of data between studies. However, so far only limited data exist from large and well-phenotyped human cohorts and current methods for analysis do not fully account for the characteristics of these data. The primary aim of this study was to identify, quantify and compare the impact of a comprehensive set of clinical and lifestyle related factors on metabolite levels in three large human cohorts. To achieve this goal, we improve current methodology by developing a principled analysis approach, which could be translated to other cohorts and metabolite panels.Methods63 Metabolites (amino acids, acylcarnitines) were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in three cohorts (total N = 16,222). Supported by a simulation study evaluating various analytical approaches, we developed an analysis pipeline including preprocessing, identification, and quantification of factors affecting metabolite levels. We comprehensively identified uni- and multivariable metabolite associations considering 29 environmental and clinical factors and performed metabolic pathway enrichment and network analyses.ResultsInverse normal transformation of batch corrected and outlier removed metabolite levels accompanied by linear regression analysis proved to be the best suited method to deal with the metabolite data. Association analyses revealed numerous uni- and multivariable significant associations. 15 of the analyzed 29 factors explained >1% of variance for at least one of the metabolites. Strongest factors are application of steroid hormones, reticulocytes, waist-to-hip ratio, sex, haematocrit, and age. Effect sizes of factors are comparable across studies.ConclusionsWe introduced a principled approach for the analysis of MS data allowing identification, and quantification of effects of clinical and lifestyle factors with metabolite levels. We detected a number of known and novel associations broadening our understanding of the regulation of the human metabolome. The large heterogeneity observed between cohorts could almost completely be explained by differences in the distribution of influencing factors emphasizing the necessity of a proper confounder analysis when interpreting metabolite associations.Keywords: Amino acids, Acylcarnitines, Metabolomics, Clinical factors, Lifestyle factors, Network analysisAbbreviations: AA, amino acid; AC, acylcarnitine; BMI, body mass index; T2D, diabetes mellitus type 2; ATC, anatomical therapeutic chemical (code for medication); LDL, low-density lipoprotein; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; INT-LR, inverse normal transformation (INT) followed by linear regression (LR); WHR, waist-to-hip ratio; MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; BP, blood pressure",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6734104/,abstract

Recently, more attention has been given to the use of Se supplementation as a new treatment for thyroid disorders. Oxidative stress increases in different thyroid disorders and causes many pathological outcomes. The present study aimed to determine the serum prooxidant-anti - oxidant balance (PAB), Se, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) concentration in congenital hypothyroidism (CH) patients and the association of their probable change with hematological indices.MethodsBlood samples were collected from 60 healthy and 39 CH subjects. Serum PAB values were measured and Se, TSH, FT4 and hematological indices were determined. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 16 and p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsSerum TSH concentration was significantly higher in CH patients group compared to the controls (p value < 0.05); however, FT4 was in the same concentration in patients and controls. Platelet (Plt) and lymphocytes (Lym) counts markedly decreased in all patients and showed a significant direct correlation with serum TSH levels (rs = 0.307, p value = 0.004 and rs = 0.413, p value < 0.0001). Serum PAB and Se had no significant correlation with he - mato logical indices in the studied subjects.ConclusionsAlthough there was no correlation between PAB and also Se with hematologic and biochemical markers in CH patients, changes in these two factors might be considered as a potential risk factor due to the other known effects of high PAB values and low Se concentrations.Keywords: congenital hypothyroidism, free thyroxine, prooxidant-antioxidant balance, selenium, thyroid stimulating hormone",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6298467/,abstract

Longitudinal metabolic concentration data of 47 individuals from 4 different groups were examined, obtained from a cycle ergometry cohort study. In total, 110 metabolites (within the classes of acylcarnitines, amino acids, and sugars) were measured through a targeted metabolomics approach, combining tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with the concept of stable isotope dilution (SID) for metabolite quantitation. Biomarker candidates were selected by combined analysis of maximum fold changes (MFCs) in concentrations and P-values resulting from statistical hypothesis testing. Characteristic kinetic signatures were identified through a mathematical modeling approach utilizing polynomial fitting. Modeled kinetic signatures were analyzed for groups with similar behavior by applying hierarchical cluster analysis. Kinetic shape templates were characterized, defining different forms of basic kinetic response patterns, such as sustained, early, late, and other forms, that can be used for metabolite classification. Acetylcarnitine (C2), showing a late response pattern and having the highest values in MFC and statistical significance, was classified as late marker and ranked as strong predictor (MFC = 1.97, P < 0.001). In the class of amino acids, highest values were shown for alanine (MFC = 1.42, P < 0.001), classified as late marker and strong predictor. Glucose yields a delayed response pattern, similar to a hockey stick function, being classified as delayed marker and ranked as moderate predictor (MFC = 1.32, P < 0.001). These findings coincide with existing knowledge on central metabolic pathways affected in exercise physiology, such as β-oxidation of fatty acids, glycolysis, and glycogenolysis.

We designed a survey to characterize the dietary habits of Italian adult PKU patients and to identify psychological factors influencing disease perception and adherence to diet. Participants to the survey (n = 111; response rate 94%) were asked to complete a structured questionnaire. Patients appeared to have an altered perception and awareness of the disease. About 40% of them did not consider PKU a disease and, despite declaring regular monitoring of phenylalanine levels (85%), nearly half of them reported a high plasma value over the last 6 months (>600 μmol/L, 48%) or were unable to specify it (31%). Adherence to PKU diet was unsatisfactory, with increased consumption of natural protein sources and reduced daily use of amino-acid supplements (<4–5 times/day in 82% patients). In addition to the intrinsic characteristics of AA formula (palatability, ease of use), the most important factor influencing their consumption was the increased social pressure associated with their use (55%). Plasma phenylalanine periodical measurements (61%) and examinations at metabolic centers (49%) were considered relevant for compliance to diet. In Italian adult PKU patients dietary management was found to be inadequate, likely due to inappropriate perception and knowledge of the disease, and lack of awareness of the negative impact of poor metabolic control in adult life.

LNCS are food additives that are broadly used as sugar substitutes to sweeten foods and beverages with the addition of fewer or no calories. They are also used in medicines, health-care products, such as toothpaste, and food supplements. The goal of this Consensus was to provide a useful, evidence-based, point of reference to assist in efforts to reduce free sugars consumption in line with current international public health recommendations. Participating experts in the Lisbon Consensus analysed and evaluated the evidence in relation to the role of LNCS in food safety, their regulation and the nutritional and dietary aspects of their use in foods and beverages. The conclusions of this Consensus were: (1) LNCS are some of the most extensively evaluated dietary constituents, and their safety has been reviewed and confirmed by regulatory bodies globally including the World Health Organisation, the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Food Safety Authority; (2) Consumer education, which is based on the most robust scientific evidence and regulatory processes, on the use of products containing LNCS should be strengthened in a comprehensive and objective way; (3) The use of LNCS in weight reduction programmes that involve replacing caloric sweeteners with LNCS in the context of structured diet plans may favour sustainable weight reduction. Furthermore, their use in diabetes management programmes may contribute to a better glycaemic control in patients, albeit with modest results. LNCS also provide dental health benefits when used in place of free sugars; (4) It is proposed that foods and beverages with LNCS could be included in dietary guidelines as alternative options to products sweetened with free sugars; (5) Continued education of health professionals is required, since they are a key source of information on issues related to food and health for both the general population and patients.

Among the methods applied for measurement of myelin water fraction (MWF) and relaxation times, the multicomponent driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) approach is of particular interest. mcDESPOT permits whole brain mapping of multicomponent T1 and T2, with data acquisition accomplished within a clinically realistic acquisition time. Unfortunately, previous studies have indicated the limited performance of mcDESPOT in the setting of the modest signal-to-noise range of high-resolution mapping, required for the depiction of small structures and to reduce partial volume effects. Recently, we showed that a new Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC) analysis substantially improved determination of MWF from mcDESPOT imaging data. However, our previous study was limited in that it did not discuss determination of relaxation times. Here, we extend the BMC analysis to the simultaneous determination of whole-brain MWF and relaxation times using the two-component mcDESPOT signal model. Simulation analyses and in-vivo human brain studies indicate the overall greater performance of this approach compared to the stochastic region contraction (SRC) algorithm, conventionally used to derive parameter estimates from mcDESPOT data. SRC estimates of the transverse relaxation time of the long T2 fraction, T2,l, and the longitudinal relaxation time of the short T1 fraction, T1,s, clustered towards the lower and upper parameter search space limits, respectively, indicating failure of the fitting procedure. We demonstrate that this effect is absent in the BMC analysis. Our results also showed improved parameter estimation for BMC as compared to SRC for high-resolution mapping. Overall we find that the combination of BMC analysis and mcDESPOT, BMC-mcDESPOT, shows excellent performance for accurate high-resolution whole-brain mapping of MWF and bi-component transverse and longitudinal relaxation times within a clinically realistic acquisition time.Keywords: Brain, MRI, High-resolution mapping, Myelin water fraction, Relaxation times",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5303643/,abstract

While newborn screening has virtually eradicated intellectual disability due to severe congenital hypothyroidism in the developed world, more stringent screening strategies have resulted in increased detection of mild congenital hypothyroidism. Recent studies provide conflicting evidence about the potential neurodevelopmental risks posed by mild congenital hypothyroidism, highlighting the need for additional research to further define what risks these patients face and whether they are likely to benefit from treatment. Moreover, while the apparent incidence of congenital hypothyroidism has increased in recent decades, the underlying cause remains obscure in most cases. However, ongoing research into genetic causes of congenital hypothyroidism continues to shed new light on the development and physiology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. The identification of IGSF1 as a cause of central congenital hypothyroidism has uncovered potential new regulatory pathways in both pituitary thyrotropes and gonadotropes, while mounting evidence suggests that a significant proportion of primary congenital hypothyroidism may be caused by combinations of rare genetic variants in multiple genes involved in thyroid development and function.

Amino acid transfer is mediated by a broad array of specific plasma membrane transporters with overlapping substrate specificity. However, it is not fully understood how these different transporters work together to mediate net flux across the placenta. Therefore the aim of this study was to develop a new computational model to describe how human placental amino acid transfer functions as an integrated system. Amino acid transfer from mother to fetus requires transport across the two plasma membranes of the placental syncytiotrophoblast, each of which contains a distinct complement of transporter proteins. A compartmental modelling approach was combined with a carrier based modelling framework to represent the kinetics of the individual accumulative, exchange and facilitative classes of transporters on each plasma membrane. The model successfully captured the principal features of transplacental transfer. Modelling results clearly demonstrate how modulating transporter activity and conditions such as phenylketonuria, can increase the transfer of certain groups of amino acids, but that this comes at the cost of decreasing the transfer of others, which has implications for developing clinical treatment options in the placenta and other transporting epithelia.Keywords: Amino acids, Placenta, Epithelial transport, Mathematical model",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4884669/,abstract

Remarkably, the MYO15A p.(Val1400Met) variant was identified in 8 families from the city of Monte Santo in the Northeast region of Brazil. Haplotype analysis of this variant was consistent with a single founder. No other cases with this variant were detected among 105 simplex cases from other cities of Northeastern Brazil, suggesting that this variant is confined to a geographical region. This study suggests that it is feasible to develop population-specific screening for deafness variants once causative variants are identified in different geographical groups.Keywords: Founder, gene, hearing loss, targeted resequencing",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127167/,abstract

These factors are well studied in the liver, pancreas and kidney, where they direct tissue-specific gene regulation. However, they also have an important role in the biology of many other tissues, including the intestine. We investigated the transcriptional network governed by HNF1 in an intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco2). We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by direct sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify HNF1 binding sites genome-wide. Direct targets of HNF1 were validated using conventional ChIP assays and confirmed by siRNA-mediated depletion of HNF1, followed by RT-qPCR. Gene ontology process enrichment analysis of the HNF1 targets identified multiple processes with a role in intestinal epithelial cell function, including properties of the cell membrane, cellular response to hormones, and regulation of biosynthetic processes. Approximately 50% of HNF1 binding sites were also occupied by other members of the intestinal transcriptional network, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), and forkhead box A2 (FOXA2). Depletion of HNF1 in Caco2 cells increases FOXA2 abundance and decreases levels of CDX2, illustrating the coordinated activities of the network. These data suggest that HNF1 plays an important role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell function, both directly and through interactions with other intestinal transcription factors.Keywords: HNF1, intestinal epithelium, transcriptional network, glucose transport",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4818657/,abstract

Studies on tumor metabolism show that improved glycolysis and glutaminolysis are necessary to maintain rapid cell proliferation, tumor progression, and resistance to cell death. Thyroid neoplasms are common endocrine tumors that are more prevalent in women and elderly individuals. The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased in the Past decades, and recent findings describing the metabolic profiles of thyroid tumors have emerged. Currently, several drugs are in development or clinical trials that target the altered metabolic pathways of tumors are undergoing.

However, the efficiencies of cell engraftment and stable genetic modification are low and often sub-therapeutic. In particular, targeted gene modifications from homologous recombination are rare events. These obstacles could be overcome if hepatocytes that have undergone genetic modification were to be selectively amplified or expanded. Here we describe a universally applicable system for in vivo selection and expansion of gene-modified hepatocytes in any genetic background. In this system, the therapeutic transgene is co-expressed with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that confers modified hepatocytes with resistance to drug-induced toxicity. An shRNA against the tyrosine catabolic enzyme 4-OH-phenylpyruvate dioxygenase (Hpd) protected hepatocytes from 4-[(2-carboxyethyl)-hydroxyphosphinyl]-3-oxobutyrate (CEHPOBA), a small molecule inhibitor of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH). In order to select for specific gene targeting events, the protective shRNA was embedded in a miRNA and inserted into a recombinant AAV vector designed to integrate site-specifically into the highly active albumin locus. After selection of the gene-targeted cells, transgene expression increased 10- to 1,000-fold, reaching supra-physiological levels of 50,000 ng/mL of human factor 9 protein in mice. This drug resistance system can be used to achieve therapeutically relevant transgene levels in hepatocytes in any setting.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5242329/,abstract

We aimed to investigate metabolic control, eating habits and nutrient supply under long-term BH4-therapy.Patients and methodsRetrospective analysis of mean dried blood Phe concentrations and their variability, food and nutrient intake in BH4-sensitive patients (n = 8, 3f, age 6.0–16.6 y) under classical dietary treatment for one year and during the three years after initiation of BH4.ResultsPhe concentrations of BH4-sensitve PKU patients remained within therapeutic range throughout the observation period, independent of therapeutic regime. Under BH4, Phe tolerance increased significantly (493.2 ± 161.8 mg/d under classical diet vs 2021.93 ± 897.4 mg/d two years under BH4; P = 0.004). Variability of Phe concentrations remained unchanged (mean SD; P = 1.000). Patients adjust their food choice and significantly increased their intake of cereals, potatoes, dairy products and meat (P = 0.019, P = 0.016, P = 0.016 and P = 0.016, respectively).

A questionnaire-based survey was performed to document diagnosis and management practices for PKU in a region of Southern and Eastern Europe. Prevalence and management data were obtained from 37/59 (63 %) centres within 19/22 (86 %) contacted countries (N = 8600 patients). The main results’ analysis was based on completed questionnaires obtained from 31 centres (53 %) within 15 countries (68 %). A median of 10 % of patients per centre had been diagnosed after the newborn period. Metabolic dieticians and specialised adult PKU clinics were lacking in 36 and 84 % of centres, respectively. In 26 % of centres, treatment initiation was delayed until >15 days of life. Blood phenylalanine (Phe) thresholds to start treatment and upper Phe targets were inconsistent across centres. Ten percent of centres reported monitoring Phe every 2 weeks for pregnant women with PKU, which is insufficient to minimise risk of neonatal sequalae. Sapropterin dihydrochloride treatment was available in 48 % of centres, with 24-h responsiveness tests most common (36 %). Only one centre among the five countries lacking newborn screening provided a completed questionnaire.Conclusion: Targeted efforts by health care professionals and governments are needed to optimise diagnostic and management approaches for PKU in Southern and Eastern Europe.“What is Known”• PKU must be detected early and optimally managed throughout life to avoid poor outcomes, yet newborn screening is not universal and diagnostic and management practices for PKU are known to vary widely between different centres and countries.
• Targeted efforts by health care professionals and governments are needed to optimise diagnostic and management approaches.
“What is New”• PKU management practices are documented in 19 South and Eastern European countries indicating a heterogeneous situation across the region.
• Key areas for improvement identified in surveyed centres include a need for comprehensive screening in all countries, increased number of metabolic dietitians and specialised adult PKU clinics, delayed time to treatment initiation, appropriate Phe thresholds, Phe targets and monitoring frequencies, and universal access to currently available treatment options.

Here we report that this rescue results from use of asparagine in protein synthesis. All mammalian cell lines tested lacked cytosolic asparaginase activity and could not utilize asparagine to produce other amino acids or biosynthetic intermediates. Instead, most glutamine-deprived cell lines are capable of sufficient glutamine synthesis to maintain essential amino acid uptake and production of the glutamine-dependent biosynthetic precursors – with the exception of asparagine. While experimental introduction of cytosolic asparaginase could enhance the synthesis of glutamine, increase TCA cycle anaplerosis and the synthesis of nucleotide precursors, cytosolic asparaginase suppressed the growth and survival of cells in glutamine-depleted media in vitro and severely compromised the in vivo growth of tumor xenografts. These results suggest that the lack of asparaginase activity represents an evolutionary adaptation to allow mammalian cells to survive pathophysiologic variations in extracellular glutamine.Index: glutamine, asparagine, translation, asparaginase",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5803449/,abstract

Rats were divided into the normal group, model group, CTG group, and allopurinol group. Serum uric acid, creatinine, urea nitrogen, and inflammatory cytokine levels were determined in each group. In the model group, ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the metabolic profiles and delineate the action mechanism of CTG; in addition, the orthogonal projection method was used to perform latent structure-discrimination analysis to screen the related metabolites. The results indicated significant differences in the metabolic profiles between the model and normal groups. A total of seven related metabolites were identified through screening in the model group, mainly related to the pathways of bile secretion, pyrimidine, purine, and phenylalanine metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and pentose and glucuronate interconversions; these related pathways were reversed in the CTG group. In the metabolic networks, uracil and acetyl-coenzyme A were the nodal molecules. In addition, the test results of the evaluation of serum biochemical and inflammatory factors confirmed that CTG had significant effect in reducing the levels of serum uric acid and protecting renal function.

In short, we explore a number of genetic conditions, which carry some benefits in adverse circumstances including exposure to infectious agents. The examples discussed are conditions known to result in resistance to a specific infectious disease, or have been proposed as being associated with resistance to various infectious diseases. These infectious disease—genetic disorder pairings include malaria and hemoglobinopathies, cholera and cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and Tay-Sachs disease, mycotic abortions and phenylketonuria, infection by enveloped viruses and disorders of glycosylation, infection by filoviruses and Niemann–Pick C1 disease, as well as rabies and myasthenia gravis. We also discuss two genetic conditions that lead to infectious disease hypersusceptibility, although we did not cover the large number of immunologic defects leading to infectious disease hypersusceptibilities. Four of the resistance-associated pairings (malaria/hemogloginopathies, cholera/cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis/Tay-Sachs, and mycotic abortions/phenylketonuria) appear to be a result of selection pressures in geographic regions in which the specific infectious agent is endemic. The other pairings do not appear to be based on selection pressure and instead may be serendipitous. Nonetheless, research investigating these relationships may lead to treatment options for the aforementioned diseases by exploiting established mechanisms between genetically affected cells and infectious organisms.

ResultsRecall rates vary from 0.01% to 13.3% in different programs; this wide range may be due to different protocols of screening (use of T4 or TSH or both), different laboratory techniques, site of sample collection, recall cutoff, iodine status, human error, and even CH incidence as affected by social, cultural, and regional factors of the population.ConclusionsIt is suggested to implement suitable interventions to reduce the contributing factors by improving the quality of laboratory tests, selecting conservative cut off points, control iodine deficiency, use of iodine free antiseptic during delivery, and use of more specific markers or molecular tests.

Recent clinical studies have identified mutations in this enzyme as the cause of PGM1 deficiency, an inborn error of metabolism classified as both a glycogen storage disease and a congenital disorder of glycosylation. Reported here are the first crystal structures of two disease-related missense variants of PGM1, along with the structure of the wild-type enzyme. Two independent glycine to arginine substitutions (G121R and G291R), both affecting key active site loops of PGM1, are found to induce regions of structural disorder, as evidenced by a nearly complete loss of electron density for as many as 23 amino acids. The disordered regions are not contiguous in sequence to the site of mutation, and even cross domain boundaries. Other structural rearrangements include changes in the conformations of loops and side chains, some of which occur nearly 20 Å away from the site of mutation. The induced structural disorder is correlated with increased sensitivity to proteolysis and lower resolution diffraction, particularly for the G291R variant. Examination of the multi-domain effects of these G→R mutations establishes a correlation between interdomain interfaces of the enzyme and missense variants of PGM1 associated with disease.

One thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven low-risk Chinese women, with singleton pregnancy, were enrolled for the study. Alpha-fetoprotein and free beta human chorionic gonadotropin were measured for the serum as well as for the parallel DBS samples. Partial high-risk pregnant women identified by primary blood testing (n = 38) were also subject to the secondary cfDNA screening. Diagnostic amniocentesis was utilized to confirm the screening results. The true positive rate for Down’s syndrome detection was 100% for both blood screening methods; however, the false-positive rate was 3.0% for DBS and 4.0% for serum screening, respectively. DBS correlated well with serum screening on Down’s syndrome detection. Three out of 38 primary high-risk women displayed chromosomal abnormalities by cfDNA analysis, which were confirmed by amniocentesis. Either the true detection rate or the false-positive rate for Down’s syndrome between DBS and the serum test is comparable. In addition, blood primary screening aligned with secondary cfDNA analysis, a “before and after” two-tier screening strategy, can massively decrease the false-positive rate, which, then, dramatically reduces the demand for invasive diagnostic operation.Impact statementChildren born with Down’s syndrome display a wide range of mental and physical disability. Currently, there is no effective treatment to ease the burden and anxiety of the Down’s syndrome family and the surrounding society.

Three electronic databases were searched (Ovid: Medline, Embase, CINAHL) using an electronic search strategy combining a published economic search filter with terms related to national NBSPs and screening-related technologies. These electronic searches were supplemented by searching the NHS Economic Evaluations Database (NHS EED) and hand-searching identified study reference lists. The results were tabulated and summarised as part of a narrative synthesis.ResultsA total of 27 economic evaluations [screening-related technologies (n = 11) and NBSPs (n = 16)] were identified.

Sample reports presented a genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease and type 2 diabetes, carrier screening summary results for >30 conditions, results for phenylketonuria and cystic fibrosis, and drug response results for a statin drug. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of participant comprehension.ResultsParticipants exhibited high overall comprehension (mean score: 79.1% correct). The highest comprehension (range: 81.1–97.4% correct) was observed in the statin drug response and carrier screening summary results, and lower comprehension (range: 63.6–74.8% correct) on specific carrier screening results. Higher levels of numeracy, genetic knowledge, and education were significantly associated with greater comprehension. Older age (≥ 60 years) was associated with lower comprehension scores.ConclusionsMost customers accurately interpreted the health implications of PGT results; however, comprehension varied by demographic characteristics, numeracy and genetic knowledge, and types and format of the genetic information presented.

Current strategies for AA analysis include cation exchange HPLC with post-column ninhydrin derivatization, GC-MS, and LC-MS/MS-related methods. Major drawbacks of the current methods are time-consuming procedures, derivative problems, problems with retention, and MS-sensitivity. The use of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) columns is an ideal separation mode for hydrophilic compounds like AA. Here we report a HILIC-method for analysis of 36 underivatized AA in plasma to detect defects in AA metabolism that overcomes the major drawbacks of other methods.MethodsA rapid, sensitive, and specific method was developed for the analysis of AA in plasma without derivatization using HILIC coupled with tandem mass-spectrometry (Xevo TQ, Waters).ResultsExcellent separation of 36 AA (24 quantitative/12 qualitative) in plasma was achieved on an Acquity BEH Amide column (2.1×100 mm, 1.7 μm) in a single MS run of 18 min. Plasma of patients with a known IEM in AA metabolism was analyzed and all patients were correctly identified.ConclusionThe reported method analyzes 36 AA in plasma within 18 min and provides baseline separation of isomeric AA such as leucine and isoleucine. No separation was obtained for isoleucine and allo-isoleucine.

Because of a long in vivo survival and a non-random removal from circulation, RBC can be loaded with drugs and/or contrasting agents without affecting these properties and maintaining the original immune competence. However, native or drug-loaded RBC, can be modified decorating the membrane with peptides, antibodies or small chemical entities so favoring the targeting of the processed RBC to specific cells or organs. Convenient modifications have been exploited to induce immune tolerance or immunogenicity, to deliver antibodies capable of targeting other cells, and to deliver a number of constructs that can recognize circulating pathogens or toxins. The methods used to induce membrane processing useful for biomedical applications include the use of crosslinking agents and bifunctional antibodies, biotinylation and membrane insertion. Another approach includes the expression of engineered membrane proteins upon ex vivo transfection of immature erythroid precursors with lentiviral vectors, followed by in vitro expansion and differentiation into mature erythrocytes before administration to a patient in need. Several applications have now reached the clinic and a couple of companies that take advantage from these properties of RBC are already in Phase 3 with selected applications.

Aneuploidy screening if combined with PND for a given single gene disorder, can help to detect any common aneuploidy as well as aiding sample authenticity and other probable complications which may arise during such procedures. This study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel panel of STR markers combined as a multiplex PCR kit (HapScreen™ kit) for the detection of β-thalassemia, aneuploidy screening, ruling in/out maternal cell contamination (MCC), and sample authenticity. The kit uses 7 STR markers linked to β-globin gene (HBB) as well as using 9 markers for quantitative analysis of chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y. Selection of the markers was to do linkage analysis with β-globin gene, segregation analysis and to perform a preliminary aneuploidy screening of fetal samples respectively. These markers (linked to the β-globin gene) were tested on more than 2185 samples and showed high heterozygosity values (68.4–91.4%). From 2185 fetal cases we found 3 cases of non-paternity, 5 cases of MCC, one case of sample mix-up and one case of trisomy 21 which otherwise may have end up to misdiagnosis. This kit was also successfully used on 231 blastomeres for 29 cases of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and screening (PGS).

Our data stratify MUT missense mutations into categories of biochemical defects, including (1) reduced protein level due to misfolding, (2) increased thermolability, (3) impaired enzyme activity, and (4) reduced cofactor response in substrate turnover. We further demonstrate the stabilization of wild‐type and thermolabile mutants by chemical chaperones in vitro and in bacterial cells.

Introduction: Researchers hypothesized that in phenylketonuria (PKU) high brain phenylalanine (Phe) levels and low brain tyrosine (Tyr) levels affect neuropsychological functioning. However, traditional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) yielded uncertain results of brain Phe and could not adequately measure brain Tyr. This pilot study examined the potential of correlated spectroscopy (COSY) to quantify these biomarkers and explain variability in neuropsychological functioning.
Methods: Nine adults with early treated classic PKU received magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with COSY and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Brain Phe and Tyr in parietal white matter (PWM) were compared to results in gray matter of the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG).
Results: Brain Phe ranged from 101 to 182 (mean = 136.76 ± 23.77) μmol/L in PCG and 76 to 185 (mean = 130.11 ± 37.88) μmol/L in PWM. Brain Tyr ranged from 4.0 to 7.4 (mean = 5.44 ± 1.01) μmol/L in PCG and 4.1 to 8.4 (mean = 5.90 ± 1.48) μmol/L in PWM. Correlation coefficients were largest for brain Phe PWM and measures of auditory memory (rho = −0.79), anxiety (rho = 0.79), and executive functioning (rho = 0.69). Associations were in the expected direction, with higher brain Phe and lower brain Tyr related to poorer functioning. The two participants with severe structural MRI abnormalities had low brain Tyr levels in PCG and 3/5 of the participants with moderate to severe MRI abnormalities had higher than average brain Phe levels.
Conclusion: COSY has the potential to quantify brain Phe and Tyr at low concentrations and in specific brain regions. In this pilot study, these biomarkers were associated with indices of neuropsychological functioning. Additional studies are needed to validate the COSY results.Keywords: Correlated spectroscopy (COSY), MRI spectroscopy, Neuropsychological outcome, Phenylketonuria (PKU)",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5509554/,abstract

Among newly diagnosed, untreated PD subjects and age-matched controls from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, T allele carriers showed higher PD risk (Odds Ratio=1.23, P=0.048), earlier age of onset by 5 years (P=0.003), and lower striatal DAT uptake (P=0.003).

Much less is known about gray matter (GM) in PKU, but a small body of research suggests volumetric differences compared to controls. To date, developmental trajectories of GM structure in individuals with PKU have not been examined, nor have trajectories of WM and GM been examined within a single study. To address this gap in the literature, we compared longitudinal brain development over a three-year period in individuals with PKU (n = 35; 18 male) and typically-developing controls (n = 71; 35 male) aged 7–21 years. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we observed whole-brain and regional WM differences between individuals with PKU and controls, which were often exacerbated with increasing age. In marked contrast with trajectories of WM development, trajectories of GM development did not differ between individuals with PKU and controls, indicating that neuropathology in PKU is more prominent in WM than GM. Within individuals with PKU, mediation analyses revealed that whole-brain mean diffusivity (MD) and regional MD in the corpus callosum and centrum semiovale mediated the relationship between dietary treatment compliance (i.e., Phe control) and executive abilities, suggesting a plausible neurobiological mechanism by which Phe control may influence cognitive outcomes.

In PKU, feeding patterns/practices during weaning in PKU have not been formally evaluated. In this longitudinal, prospective, case-control study (n = 20) infants with PKU transitioning to a second-stage PS, were recruited at weaning (4–6 months) for a comparison of feeding practices and development with non-PKU infants. Subjects were monitored monthly to 12 months and at age 15 months, 18 months and 24 months for: feeding progression; food textures; motor skill development and self-feeding; feeding environment; gastrointestinal symptoms; and negative feeding behaviours. Children with PKU had comparable weaning progression to non-PKU infants including texture acceptance, infant formula volume and self-feeding skills. However, children with PKU had more prolonged Phe-free infant formula bottle-feeding and parental spoon feeding than controls; fewer meals/snacks per day; and experienced more flatulence (p = 0.0005), burping (p = 0.001), retching (p = 0.03); and less regurgitation (p = 0.003). Negative behaviours associated with PS at age 10–18 months, coincided with the age of teething.

Two home delivery services were used by 41 (71%) caregivers and the remaining 17 (29%) only used one of the home delivery service companies. Each patient only stored a median of 6 (range 0–22) different LP foods at home. Overall, 45% (n = 26/58) of caregivers reported problems with their GP prescriptions. 30% (n = 16/53) of caregivers received at least one incorrect prescription when using their pharmacy (e.g. gluten-free foods instead of LP, incorrect product or incorrect product amount), 6% errors (n = 3/53) with Homeward® and 2% (n = 1/48) with Vitaflo at Home®. 49% (n = 26/53) of caregivers said they experienced delayed receipt of LP foods from their pharmacy, compared with 11% (n = 6/55) from Homeward® and 8% (n = 4/48) Vitaflo at Home®.ConclusionsAlthough home delivery services for special LP foods are associated with less errors and delay compared with pharmacies, inaccuracies and inefficiencies still occur and the overall system is complex. We suggest a new, simpler, less fragmented system whereby metabolic dietitians prescribe LP foods. This is likely to result in less burden on NHS resources and ensure a better treatment delivered to IMD patients.Keywords: Low protein foods, Home delivery service, Prescriptions, IMD",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6434332/,abstract

The need for a detailed catalog of local variability motivated the whole-exome sequencing of 267 unrelated individuals, representative of the healthy Spanish population. Like in other studies, a considerable number of rare variants were found (almost one-third of the described variants). There were also relevant differences in allelic frequencies in polymorphic variants, including ∼10,000 polymorphisms private to the Spanish population. The allelic frequencies of variants conferring susceptibility to complex diseases (including cancer, schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, type 2 diabetes, and other pathologies) were overall similar to those of other populations. However, the trend is the opposite for variants linked to Mendelian and rare diseases (including several retinal degenerative dystrophies and cardiomyopathies) that show marked frequency differences between populations. Interestingly, a correspondence between differences in allelic frequencies and disease prevalence was found, highlighting the relevance of frequency differences in disease risk. These differences are also observed in variants that disrupt known drug binding sites, suggesting an important role for local variability in population-specific drug resistances or adverse effects. We have made the Spanish population variant server web page that contains population frequency information for the complete list of 170,888 variant positions we found publicly available (http://spv.babelomics.org/), We show that it if fundamental to determine population-specific variant frequencies to distinguish real disease associations from population-specific polymorphisms.Keywords: population variability, exome sequencing, disease variants, pharmacogenomic variants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4839216/,abstract

Main outcomes included birth weight, low birth weight, small for gestational age at birth; height, height-for-age, weight, weight-for-age, weight-for-length, stunting, and wasting ≤18 y of age. Data were extracted independently in duplicate, and findings pooled using inverse variance meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored using I2, stratified analysis, and meta-regression, and publication bias by funnel plots, Egger's test, and fill/trim methods.ResultsOf 6808 unique abstracts and 357 full-text articles, 62 trials were included. The 62 trials comprised over 30,000 participants across 5 continents, including formula-based supplementation in infants and food-based supplementation in pregnancy and childhood. Maternal supplementation increased birth weight by 0.06 kg, and both formula and food-based supplementation in term infants/young children increased weight by ≤0.14 kg. Neither formula nor food-based supplementation for term infants/young children increased height, whereas the height-for-age z-score was increased in the food-based (+0.06 z-score) but not formula-based (−0.11 z-score) trials reporting this outcome. In term infants, the weight-for-length z-score was increased in trials of formula (+0.24 z-score) and food supplementation (+0.06 z-score), whereas food supplementation was also associated with reduced odds of stunting (−13%).ConclusionsSupplementation of protein from animal-source foods generally increased weight and weight-for-length in children, but with more limited effects on other growth outcomes such as attained height.Keywords: dietary protein, child, maternal, weight, height, anthropometric, birth weight, meta-analysis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6669064/,abstract

Phenylalanine (Phe) is an essential dietary amino acid with an aromatic ring structure similar to endogenous metabolites, dietary compounds and environmental agents. Excess plasma Phe in genetic disease or nutritional deficiency of Phe has adverse health consequences. In principle, structurally similar chemicals interfering with Phe utilization could alter Phe requirement at an individual level. As a strategy to identify components of the exposome that could interfere with Phe utilization, we tested for metabolites correlating with Phe concentration in plasma of a non-human primate species, common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). The results of tests for more than 5000 chemical features detected by high-resolution metabolomics showed 17 positive correlations with Phe metabolites and other amino acids. Positive and negative correlations were also observed for 33 other chemicals, which included matches to endogenous metabolites and dietary, microbial and environmental chemicals in database searches. Chemical similarity analysis showed many of the matches had high structural similarity to Phe. Together, the results show that chemicals in marmoset plasma could impact Phe utilization. Such chemicals could contribute to early lifecycle developmental disorders when neurological development is vulnerable to Phe levels.Keywords: Amino acid, Bioinformatics, Dietary exposome, Metabolomics, Phenylalanine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4329081/,abstract

GPI deficiency, transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, is considered the second most common erythro-enzymopathy of anaerobic glycolysis, after pyruvate kinase deficiency. Despite this, this defect may sometimes be misdiagnosed and only about 60 cases of GPI deficiency have been reported. GPI deficient patients are affected by chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia of variable severity; in rare cases, intellectual disability or neuromuscular symptoms have also been reported. The gene locus encoding GPI is located on chromosome 19q13.1 and contains 18 exons. So far, about 40 causative mutations have been identified. We report the clinical, hematological and molecular characteristics of 12 GPI deficient cases (eight males, four females) from 11 families, with a median age at admission of 13 years (ranging from 1 to 51); eight of them were of Italian origin. Patients displayed moderate to severe anemia, that improves with aging. Splenectomy does not always result in the amelioration of anemia but may be considered in transfusion-dependent patients to reduce transfusion intervals. None of the patients described here displayed neurological impairment attributable to the enzyme defect. We identified 13 different mutations in the GPI gene, six of them have never been described before; the new mutations affect highly conserved residues and were not detected in 1000 Genomes and HGMD databases and were considered pathogenic by several mutation algorithms. This is the largest series of GPI deficient patients so far reported in a single study.

403,10.1093/glycob/cwx070,29044377,"Go to:AbstractLiposomal encapsulation is a useful drug delivery strategy for small molecules, especially chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin. Doxil® is a doxorubicin-containing liposome (“dox-liposome”) that passively targets drug to tumors while reducing side effects caused by free drug permeating and poisoning healthy tissues. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the hydrophilic coating of Doxil® that protects the formulation from triggering the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Evading the MPS prolongs dox-liposome circulation time thus increasing drug deposition at the tumor site. However, multiple doses of Doxil® sometimes activate an anti-PEG immune response that enhances liposome clearance from circulation and causes hypersensitivity, further limiting its effectiveness against disease. These side effects constrain the utility of PEG-coated liposomes in certain populations, justifying the need for investigation into alternative coatings that could improve drug delivery for better patient quality of life and outcome. We hypothesized that heparosan (HEP; [-4-GlcA-β1-4-GlcNAc-α1-]n) may serve as a PEG alternative for coating liposomes. HEP is a natural precursor to heparin biosynthesis in mammals. Also, bacteria expressing an HEP extracellular capsule during infection escape detection and are recognized as “self,” not a foreign threat. By analogy, coating drug-carrying liposomes with HEP should camouflage the delivery vehicle from the MPS, extending circulation time and potentially avoiding immune-mediated clearance. In this study, we characterize the postmodification insertion of HEP-lipids into liposomes by dynamic light scattering and coarse-grain computer modeling, test HEP-lipid immunogenicity in rats, and compare the efficacy of drug delivered by HEP-coated liposomes to PEG-coated liposomes in a human breast cancer xenograft mouse model.Keywords: cancer, chemoenzymatic synthesis, doxorubicin, glycosaminoglycans, polyethylene glycol",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5881748/,abstract

Accordingly, approval of sapropterin in the European Union was extended in 2015 to include patients aged 0–4 years, bringing the treatment age range in line with that in the USA and providing an additional treatment option for those patients with PKU who are responsive or partially responsive to treatment with sapropterin. Subsequently, European guidelines have been published on the diagnosis and management of patients with PKU. However, testing for PKU can be demanding and requires particular expertise. We have compiled experience-based, real-world guidance in an algorithmic format to complement the published guidelines, with the overall aim to achieve optimized and individualized care for patients with PKU.ResultsOur guidance covers aspects such as how to perform, monitor and interpret appropriate biochemical measures to achieve effective patient management and desired outcomes, how to perform a tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) loading test to assess responsiveness in newborns, and how to initiate sapropterin treatment in patients from birth.

The aim of this study was to assess the burden of illness in PKU patients in general and in PKU patients born before and after the introduction of newborn screening in Germany.MethodsThis retrospective matched cohort analysis used the Institut für angewandte Gesundheitsforschung Berlin (InGef) research database containing anonymized healthcare claims of approximately 4 million covered lives. PKU patients were compared with matched controls from the general population within the same database (1:10 ratio via direct, exact matching on age and gender without replacement). PKU patients were included if they were aged ≥18 years on 01/01/15 and were continuously enrolled from 01/01/10 to 31/12/15.

The contribution of NO produced directly in the vasculature by endothelial cells to the hypotension seen in these conditions, vs. the broader systemic increase in NO, is unclear. To determine the specific role of endothelium derived NO in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular dysfunction we administered LPS to mice deficient in endothelial cell tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the essential co-factor for NO production by NOS enzymes. Mice deficient in endothelial BH4 production, through loss of the essential biosynthesis enzyme Gch1 (Gch1fl/flTie2cre mice) received a 24 hour challenge with LPS or saline control. In vivo LPS treatment increased vascular GTP cyclohydrolase and BH4 levels in aortas, lungs and hearts, but this increase was significantly attenuated in Gch1fl/flTie2cre mice, which were also partially protected from the LPS-induced hypotension. In isometric tension studies, in vivo LPS treatment reduced the vasoconstriction response and impaired endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilatations in mesenteric arteries from wild-type mice, but not in Gch1fl/flTie2cre mesenteric arteries. Ex vivo LPS treatment decreased vasoconstriction response to phenylephrine in aortic rings from wild-type and not in Gch1fl/flTie2cre mice, even in the context of significant eNOS and iNOS upregulation. These data provide direct evidence that endothelial cell NO has a significant contribution to LPS-induced vascular dysfunction and hypotension and may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of systemic inflammation and patients with septic shock.Abbreviations: Gch1, GTP cyclohydrolase 1; BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin; LPS, lipopolysaccharideKeywords: Tetrahydrobiopterin, Endothelial cell, LPS, Vascular dysfunction, Hypotension",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4746318/,abstract

We postulated that both relational reasoning and executive functioning should predict individual and developmental differences. However, executive functioning would become increasingly involved when metaphor comprehension is highly demanding, either because of the metaphors’ high difficulty (relatively novel metaphors in the absence of a context) or because of the individual’s special processing difficulties, such as low levels of reading experience or low semantic knowledge. Three groups of participants, 11-year-olds, 15-year-olds and young adults, were assessed in different relational verbal reasoning tasks—analogical and class-inclusion—and in executive functioning tasks—updating information in working memory, inhibition, and shifting. The results revealed clear progress in metaphor comprehension between ages 11 and 15 and between ages 15 and 21. However, the importance of executive function in metaphor comprehension was evident by age 15 and was restricted to updating information in working memory and cognitive inhibition. Participants seemed to use two different strategies to interpret metaphors: relational verbal reasoning and executive functioning. This was clearly shown when comparing the performance of the ""more efficient"" participants in metaphor interpretation with that of the ""less efficient” ones.

The current study aims to provide insight in relevant factors for new parents in the Netherlands regarding retention and secondary use of NDBS. These factors can be taken into account when developing or updating NDBS policies.MethodsA mixed methods design was used combining an online survey (n = 753), focus groups (6 groups, 37 participants), and individual in-depth interviews (n = 7). The discussed topics included: parental information, obtaining informed consent, support for retention, and support for secondary use. The study population consisted of Dutch-speaking new parents: pregnant women (≥20 weeks) and/or their partner, and parents of at least one child (≤5 years).ResultsNew parents expressed needs for easily accessible information, adequate communication on the retention and (potential) use of NDBS, clearly described safeguards for privacy, a more active consent process, regulation for the actors conducting NDBS research, and parental involvement in decisions on secondary use. Overall, participants were positive about prolonged retention and different types of secondary use if those needs were met.ConclusionsWhile parental involvement is a challenge, our study is an example of gauging parent’s perspectives on NDBS policy and contributes to including these perspectives in the current policy discussion on longer retention.

Luciferase reporter assays showed that the HNF-1β binding sites were located within a promoter that was active in renal epithelial cells. Mutations of the HNF-1β binding sites abolished promoter activity. RT-PCR analysis revealed that a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is transcribed from the promoter and encodes the miR-200 cluster. Inhibition of the lncRNA with siRNAs decreased the levels of miR-200 but did not affect expression of the Ttll10 host gene. The expression of the lncRNA and miR-200 was decreased in kidneys from HNF-1β knock-out mice and renal epithelial cells expressing dominant-negative mutant HNF-1β. The expression of miR-200 targets, Zeb2 and Pkd1, was increased in HNF-1β knock-out kidneys and in cells expressing mutant HNF-1β. Overexpression of miR-200 decreased the expression of Zeb2 and Pkd1 in HNF-1β mutant cells. These studies reveal a novel pathway whereby HNF-1β directly contributes to the control of miRNAs that are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cystic kidney disease.Keywords: ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), kidney, long noncoding RNA (long ncRNA, lncRNA), microRNA (miRNA), transcription regulation, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1)",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4598991/,abstract

The etiology of isolated VSD remains poorly understood. Eight core aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) (EPRS, MARS, QARS, RARS, IARS, LARS, KARS, and DARS) combine with three nonenzymatic components to form a complex known as the multisynthetase complex (MSC). Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EPRS have been reported to be associated with risks of CHD in Chinese populations.MethodsIn this study, we hypothesize that SNPs of the DARS gene might influence susceptibility to sporadic isolated VSD. Therefore, we conducted a case-control study of 841 patients with isolated VSD and 2953 non-CHD controls from the Chinese Han population to evaluate how 4 potentially functional SNPs within the DARS gene were associated with the risk of VSD.ResultsWe observed that the risk of VSD was significantly associated with rs2164331 [G/A; odds ratio (OR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.69-0.91; P = 3.17 × 10-3], rs6738266 [G/A; OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.05-1.29, P = 1.83 × 10-3], and rs309143 [G/A; OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01-1.17; P = 3.12 × 10-2]. Additionally, compared with individuals with 0-2 risk alleles, individuals carrying 3, 4, and 5 or more risk alleles had 1.01-, 1.22- and 1.46-fold greater risks of VSD, respectively. These findings revealed a significant dose-response effect for VSD risk among individuals carrying different numbers of risk alleles (Ptrend = 6.37 × 10-4).ConclusionsThese findings indicate that genetic variants of the DARS gene may influence individual susceptibility to isolated VSD in the Chinese Han population.Keywords: Ventricular septal defect, Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, Association study, Polymorphism",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5117545/,abstract

Many follow a low-phenylalanine (low-Phe) diet devoid of animal protein in combination with medical foods (MFs).ObjectiveTo assess lipid metabolism in participants with PKU consuming amino acid MFs (AA-MFs) or glycomacropeptide MFs (GMP-MFs), we conducted fatty acid and metabolomics analyses.MethodsWe used subsets of fasting plasma and urine samples from our randomized crossover trial in which participants with early-treated classical and variant (milder) PKU consumed a low-Phe diet combined with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs for 3 wk each. Fatty acid profiles of red blood cell (RBC) membranes were determined for 25 adults (aged 18–49 y) with PKU and 143 control participants. Metabolomics analyses of plasma and urine samples were conducted by Metabolon for 9–10 adolescent and adult participants with PKU and for 15 control participants.ResultsRBC fatty acid profiles were not significantly different with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs. PKU participants showed higher total n–6:n–3 (ω-6:ω-3) fatty acids (mean ± SD percentages of total fatty acids: AA-MF = 5.45% ± 1.07%; controls = 4.33%; P < 0.001) and lower docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; AA-MF = 3.21% ± 0.98%; controls = 3.70% ± 1.01%; P = 0.02) and eicosapentaenoic acid (AA-MF = 0.33% ± 0.12%; controls = 0.60% ± 0.43%; P < 0.001) in RBCs than did control participants. Despite higher carnitine intake from AA-MFs than GMP-MFs (mean ± SE intake: AA-MFs = 58.6 ± 5.3 mg/d; GMP-MFs = 0.3 ± 0.01 mg/d; P < 0.001), plasma concentrations of carnitine were similar and not different from those in the control group (AA-MF compared with GMP-MF, P = 0.73). AA-MFs resulted in higher urinary excretion of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is synthesized by bacteria from carnitine, compared with GMP-MFs (mean ± SE scaled intensity—TMAO: AA-MFs = 1.2 ± 0.1, GMP-MFs = 0.9 ± 0.1; P = 0.005). Plasma deoxycarnitine was lower in PKU participants than in control participants, suggesting reduced carnitine biosynthesis in PKU (AA-MF = 0.9 ± 0.1; GMP-MF = 1.0 ± 0.1; controls = 1.3 ± 0.1; AA-MF compared with controls, P = 0.01; GMP-MF compared with controls, P = 0.04).ConclusionsSupplementation with DHA is needed in PKU. Carnitine supplementation of AA-MFs shows reduced bioavailability due, in part, to bacterial degradation to TMAO, whereas the bioavailability of carnitine is greater with prebiotic GMP-MFs.

Treatment, which includes a low Phe diet supplemented with amino acid formulas, commences soon after diagnosis within the first weeks of life. Although dietary treatment has been successful in preventing intellectual disability in early treated PKU patients, there are major issues with dietary compliance due to palatability of the diet. Other potential issues associated with dietary therapy include nutritional deficiencies especially vitamin D and B12. Suboptimal outcomes in cognitive and executive functioning have been reported in patients who adhere poorly to dietary therapy. There have been continuous attempts at improving the quality of medical foods including their palatability. Advances in dietary therapy such as the use of large neutral amino acids (LNAA) and glycomacropeptides (GMP; found within the whey fraction of bovine milk) have been explored.

The increased expression of the L-type amino acid transporter (LAT2) and its adapter protein 4F2 heavy chain appeared to be responsible for the higher sensitivity to phenylalanine in K562-D cells. Supplementation with valine over phenylalanine effectively restored cell proliferation, although other amino acids did not improve K562-D cell proliferation over phenylalanine. Biochemical analysis revealed mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) as a terminal target of phenylalanine in K562-D cell proliferation, and supplementation of valine restored mTORC1 activity.

Congenital anomalies were classified following the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) classification.ResultsA total of 2414 assisted reproductive technology (ART) pregnancies were compared to 582 spontaneous conceptions in the control infertile group representing 2306 deliveries. No significant differences were found in pregnancy outcome between the two groups (delivery rate, abortion rate, ectopic pregnancies, medical abortions for fetal anomalies, single and twins mean gestational age, and weight at delivery). A significant difference (p < 0.001) was found in the twin (21.3 vs 2.3 %) and triplet rates (2.3 vs 0 %). A total of 2351 babies were delivered in the ART group and 449 in the control group. A total of 90 babies (3.8 %) were diagnosed with a major congenital anomaly in the ART group and 15 (3.3 %) in the control group (p = ns). The overall rate of major congenital anomalies (105/2800) in ART and spontaneous pregnancies in infertile couples was significantly higher when compared to the EUROCAT 2.0 versus 3.75 % (p = 0.0002).DiscussionBabies born after ART treatments and from spontaneous conception in infertile couples had rates of congenital anomalies higher than those recorded by the EUROCAT. However, the rates of anomalies were not different within the infertile population whether conceived by ART or spontaneously.

Background. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a cofactor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is reduced during the early stage of vascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetic vasculopathy, and even throughout the entire progression of atherosclerosis. Methods. A literature search was performed using electronic databases (up to January 31, 2014), including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), using an established strategy. Results. Fourteen articles were selected with a total of 370 patients. Ten of the fourteen studies showed a significant improvement in the endothelial dysfunction of various cardiovascular disease groups with BH4 supplementation compared with the control groups or placebos. Three studies showed no positive outcome, and one study showed that low-dose BH4 had no effect but that high-dose BH4 did have a significantly different result. Conclusions. This review concludes that supplementation with BH4 and/or augmentation of the endogenous levels of BH4 will be a novel approach to improve the endothelial dysfunction observed in various cardiovascular diseases. BH4 might be considered to be a new therapeutic agent to prevent the initiation and progression of cardiovascular disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4273464/,abstract
424,10.1371/journal.ppat.1004667,25764397,"Go to:AbstractTetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a co-factor required for catalytic activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and amino acid-monooxygenases, including phenylalanine hydroxylase. BH4 is unstable: during oxidative stress it is non-enzymatically oxidized to dihydrobiopterin (BH2), which inhibits NOS. Depending on BH4 availability, NOS oscillates between NO synthase and NADPH oxidase: as the BH4/BH2 ratio decreases, NO production falls and is replaced by superoxide. In African children and Asian adults with severe malaria, NO bioavailability decreases and plasma phenylalanine increases, together suggesting possible BH4 deficiency. The primary three biopterin metabolites (BH4, BH2 and B0 [biopterin]) and their association with disease severity have not been assessed in falciparum malaria. We measured pterin metabolites in urine of adults with severe falciparum malaria (SM; n=12), moderately-severe malaria (MSM, n=17), severe sepsis (SS; n=5) and healthy subjects (HC; n=20) as controls. In SM, urinary BH4 was decreased (median 0.16 ¼mol/mmol creatinine) compared to MSM (median 0.27), SS (median 0.54), and HC (median 0.34)]; p<0.001. Conversely, BH2 was increased in SM (median 0.91 ¼mol/mmol creatinine), compared to MSM (median 0.67), SS (median 0.39), and HC (median 0.52); p<0.001, suggesting increased oxidative stress and insufficient recycling of BH2 back to BH4 in severe malaria. Overall, the median BH4/BH2 ratio was lowest in SM [0.18 (IQR: 0.04-0.32)] compared to MSM (0.45, IQR 0.27-61), SS (1.03; IQR 0.54-2.38) and controls (0.66; IQR 0.43-1.07); p<0.001. In malaria, a lower BH4/BH2 ratio correlated with decreased microvascular reactivity (r=0.41; p=0.03) and increased ICAM-1 (r=-0.52; p=0.005). Decreased BH4 and increased BH2 in severe malaria (but not in severe sepsis) uncouples NOS, leading to impaired NO bioavailability and potentially increased oxidative stress. Adjunctive therapy to regenerate BH4 may have a role in improving NO bioavailability and microvascular perfusion in severe falciparum malaria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4357386/,abstract

Introduction: Progress in diagnosis and treatment of patients with intoxication-type inborn errors of metabolism (IT-IEM) such as urea cycle disorders, organic acidurias or maple syrup urine disease is resulting in a growing number of long-term survivors. Consequently, health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of patients is increasingly regarded as a meaningful outcome parameter. To develop the first validated, disease-specific HrQoL questionnaire for IT-IEM, patients and parents were interviewed as content experts to identify major physical and psychosocial constraints and resources.
Methods: Focus group interviews with 19 paediatric IT-IEM patients and 26 parents were conducted in four metabolic centres in Austria, Germany and Switzerland. Disease-specific HrQoL categories were established by qualitative content analysis.
Results: Fourteen disease-specific topics related to the three well-established generic HrQoL dimensions of physical, mental and social functioning were derived from the interview transcripts. Both patients and parents perceived dietary restrictions and social stigmatisation as major burdens. Dietary restrictions and emotional burdens were more important for young (<8 years) patients, whereas cognition, fatigue and social issues were more relevant to older patients (≥8 years). Treatment-related topics had a significant effect on social and emotional HrQoL.
Discussion: By exploring patients’ and parents’ perspectives, 14 HrQoL categories were identified. These new categories will allow the development of a disease-specific, standardised questionnaire to assess HrQoL in paediatric IT-IEM patients. Age-appropriate information on the disease and psychosocial support targeted to patients’ individual burdens are essential to the delivery of personalised care that takes account of physical, mental and social dimensions of HrQoL.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388637/,abstract

Sixty minutes of elution time produced maximal reproducibility and minimal bias of results. Within assay standard deviation: 0.058; average bias: -0.02%. Stability of eluted blood did not vary significantly between days 0-2 after DBS elution.ConclusionsMeasurement of HbA1c levels on DBS from human blood is feasible. Results suggest new method using DBS to measure HbA1c level with the following characteristics: optimal time for sample analysis 3-6 days after collection, elution time of 60 minutes and eluted blood analysis within 2 days of elution. Measurement of neonatal HbA1c could provide insight regarding the infant's in utero exposure to glucose.Keywords: Hemoglobin A1c, filter paper, diabetes, obesity, newborn screening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4875889/,abstract

NBS is a public health success, providing reduction in mortality and improved developmental outcomes for screened conditions.. However, it is less clear to what extent newborn screening achieves the long-term goals relating to improved health, growth, development and function. We propose a framework for assessing outcomes for the health and well-being of children identified through NBS programs. The framework proposed here, and this manuscript, were approved for publication by the Secretary of Health and Human Services’ Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC). This framework can be applied to each screened condition within the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), recognizing that the data elements and measures will vary by condition. As an example, we applied the framework to sickle cell disease and phenylketonuria (PKU), two diverse conditions with different outcome measures and potential sources of data. Widespread and consistent application of this framework across state NBS and child health systems is envisioned as useful to standardize approaches to assessment of outcomes and for continuous improvement of the NBS and child health systems.Keywords: newborn screening, long-term follow-up, outcomes, quality improvement",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4970906/,abstract

Clinical relevance of how these susceptible genes shape the development of IBD is also a high priority. The main challenge is to understand how the environment and microbiome play a role in triggering disease in genetically susceptible individual, as the interactions may be complex. To advance the field, novel in vitro and mouse models that are designed to interrogate complex genetics and be able to functionally test hypotheses are needed.

We evaluated transcriptional regulation of SULT1C2 by mevalonate (MVA)-derived intermediates in primary cultured rat hepatocytes using several cholesterol synthesis inhibitors. Blocking production of mevalonate with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin (30 μM), reduced SULT1C2 mRNA content by ∼40% whereas the squalene synthase inhibitor squalestatin (SQ1, 0.1 μM), which causes accumulation of nonsterol isoprenoids, increased mRNA content by 4-fold. Treatment with MVA (10 mM) strongly induced SULT1C2 mRNA by 12-fold, and this effect was blocked by inhibiting squalene epoxidase but not by more distal cholesterol inhibitors, indicating the effects of MVA are mediated by postsqualene metabolites. Using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), we characterized the 5′ end of SULT1C2 mRNA and used this information to generate constructs for promoter analysis. SQ1 and MVA increased reporter activity by ∼1.6- and 3-fold, respectively, from a construct beginning 49 base pairs (bp) upstream from the longest 5′-RACE product (-3140:-49). Sequence deletions from this construct revealed a hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) element (-2558), and mutation of this element reduced basal (75%) and MVA-induced (30%) reporter activity and attenuated promoter activation following overexpression of HNF1α or 1β. However, the effects of SQ1 were localized to a more proximal promoter region (-281:-49). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates influence SULT1C2 expression in rat primary hepatocytes. Further, HNF1 appears to play an important role in mediating basal and MVA-induced SULT1C2 transcription.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4658488/,abstract

The NC NEXUS (Newborn Exome Sequencing for Universal Screening) study seeks to assess the technical possibilities and limitations of NGS-NBS, devise and evaluate a framework to convey various types of genetic information, and develop best practices for incorporating NGS-NBS into clinical care. The study is enrolling both a healthy cohort and a cohort diagnosed with known disorders identified through recent routine NBS. It uses a novel age-based metric to categorize a priori the large amount of data generated by NGS-NBS and interactive online decision aids to guide parental decision-making. Primary outcomes include: (1) assessment of NGS-NBS sensitivity, (2) decision regret, and (3) parental decision-making about NGS-NBS, and, for parents randomized to have the option of requesting them, additional findings (diagnosed and healthy cohorts). Secondary outcomes assess parents’ reactions to the study and to decision-making.Methods/designParticipants are parents and children in a well-child cohort recruited from a prenatal clinic and a diagnosed cohort recruited from pediatric clinics that treat children with disorders diagnosed through traditional NBS (goal of 200 children in each cohort). In phase 1, all parent participants use an online decision aid to decide whether to accept NGS-NBS for their child and provide consent for NGS-NBS. In phase 2, parents who consent to NGS-NBS are randomized to a decision arm or control arm (2:1 allocation) and learn their child’s NGS-NBS results, which include conditions from standard (non-NGS) NBS plus other highly actionable childhood-onset conditions. Parents in the decision arm use a second decision aid to make decisions about additional results from their child’s sequencing. In phase 3, decision arm participants learn additional results they have requested.

Development of obesity is also linked to changes in fatty acid and amino acid metabolism observed in animal models of obesity as well as in humans. The aim of this study was to explore whether plasma metabolome, namely the levels of various acylcarnitines and amino acids, could serve as a biomarker of propensity to obesity and impaired glucose metabolism. Taking advantage of a high phenotypic variation in diet-induced obesity in C57BL/6J mice, 12-week-old male and female mice (n = 155) were fed a high-fat diet (lipids ~32 wt%) for a period of 10 weeks, while body weight gain (BWG) and changes in insulin sensitivity (ΔHOMA-IR) were assessed. Plasma samples were collected before (week 4) and after (week 22) high-fat feeding. Both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were then used to examine the relationships between plasma metabolome and selected phenotypes including BWG and ΔHOMA-IR. Partial least squares-discrimination analysis was able to distinguish between animals selected either for their low or high BWG (or ΔHOMA-IR) in male but not female mice. Among the metabolites that differentiated male mice with low and high BWG, and which also belonged to the major discriminating metabolites when analyzed in plasma collected before and after high-fat feeding, were amino acids Tyr and Orn, as well as acylcarnitines C16-DC and C18:1-OH. In general, the separation of groups selected for their low or high ΔHOMA-IR was less evident and the outcomes of a corresponding multivariate analysis were much weaker than in case of BWG.

Primary endpoint was PDR (the number of patients with ≥1 polypoid or flat lesion recorded by the colonoscopist).MethodsDiagnostic, surveillance or screening colonoscopy patients were enrolled into this investigator-blinded, multi-center Phase IV study and randomized 1:1 to receive PEG+Asc (administered the evening before and the morning of colonoscopy, per label) or NaPic/MgCit (administered in the morning and afternoon the day before colonoscopy, per label). The blinded colonoscopist documented any lesion and assessed cleansing quality (Harefield Cleansing Scale).ResultsOf 394 patients who completed the study, 393 (PEG+Asc, N=200; NaPic/MgCit, N=193) had a colonoscopy. Overall PDR for PEG+Asc versus NaPic/MgCit was 51.5% versus 44.0%, p=0.139. PDR and ADR on the right side of the bowel were significantly higher with PEG+Asc versus NaPic/MgCit (PDR: 56[28.0%] versus 32[16.6%], p=0.007; ADR: 42[21.0%] versus 23[11.9%], p=0.015), as was detection of flat lesions (43[21.5%] versus 25[13.0%], p=0.025). Cleansing quality was better with PEG+Asc than NaPic/MgCit (98.5% versus 57.5% considered successful cleansing). Overall, there were 132 treatment-emergent adverse events (93 versus 39 for PEG+Asc and NaPic/MgCit, respectively). These were mainly mild abdominal symptoms, all of which were reported for higher proportions of patients in the PEG+Asc than NaPic/MgCit group. Twice as many patients in the NaPic/MgCit versus the PEG+Asc group reported tolerance of cleansing solution as ‘very good’.ConclusionsCompared with NaPic/MgCit, PEG+Asc may be more efficacious for overall cleansing ability, and subsequent detection of right-sided and flat lesions. This is likely attributable to the different administration schedules of the two bowel cleansing preparations, which may positively impact the detection and prevention of colorectal cancer, thereby improving mortality rates.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov {""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT01689792"",""term_id"":""NCT01689792""}}NCT01689792.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423835/,abstract

HNF1alpha-deficiency leads to defective insulin secretion via a molecular mechanism that is still not completely understood. Moreover, in MODY3 patients the severity of insulin secretion can be extremely variable even in the same kindred, indicating that modifier genes may control the onset of the disease. With the use of a mouse model for HNF1alpha-deficiency, we show here that specific genetic backgrounds (C3H and CBA) carry a powerful genetic suppressor of diabetes. A genome scan analysis led to the identification of a major suppressor locus on chromosome 3 (Moda1). Moda1 locus contains 11 genes with non-synonymous SNPs that significantly interacts with other loci on chromosomes 4, 11 and 18. Mechanistically, the absence of HNF1alpha in diabetic-prone (sensitive) strains leads to postnatal defective islets growth that is remarkably restored in resistant strains. Our findings are relevant to human genetics since Moda1 is syntenic with a human locus identified by genome wide association studies of fasting glycemia in patients. Most importantly, our results show that a single genetic locus can completely suppress diabetes in Hnf1a-deficiency.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5036084/,abstract

The pathogenic nature of the mutation was assessed with PolyPhen-2. Disease-specific databases were used to assess whether the missense mutation led to a severe phenotype, and whether pharmacological therapy was an option. Results: An inexpensive bioinformatics approach is presented to get the reader acquainted with the diagnosis of Fabry disease.

Current therapies are essentially still ineffective, due both to the tumor heterogeneity and the frequent late diagnosis, making necessary the creation of new therapeutic strategies to inhibit tumor onset and progression and improve the survival of patients. A promising strategy for treatment of HCC is the targeted molecular therapy based on the restoration of tumor suppressor proteins lost during neoplastic transformation.

Cumulative molecular damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), the by-products of oxidative phosphorylation, is one of these mechanisms (ROS concept). Deregulated nutrient sensing by the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) pathway is the second mechanism (IIS concept). Temperature reduction (TR) is known to modulate aging and prolong life span in a variety of organisms, but the mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here we first demonstrate that late-onset TR from 26°C to 22°C extends mean life span and maximum life span by approximately 5.2 and 3 weeks, respectively, in the annual fish Nothobranchius guentheri. We then show that TR is able to decrease the accumulation of the histological aging markers senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) in the epithelium and lipofuscin (LF) in the liver and to reduce protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation levels in the muscle. We also show that TR can enhance the activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, and stimulate the synthesis of SirT1 and FOXO3A/FOXO1A, both of which are the downstream regulators of the IIS pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that late-onset TR, a simple non-intrusion intervention, can retard the aging process in aged fish, resulting in their life span extension, via a synergistic action of an anti-oxidant system and the IIS pathway.

Here, by positional cloning, we report that the 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) gene, encoding a key enzyme of BH4 biosynthesis, is responsible for the alc (albino C) mutation that displays pale body color, head shaking, and eventually lethality after the first molting in silkworm. Compared to wild type, the alc mutant produced more substrates (phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr)) and generated less DOPA and dopamine. Application of 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) to block BH4 synthesis in the wild type effectively produced the alc-like phenotype, while BH4 supplementation rescued the defective body color and lethal phenotype in both alc and DAHP-treated individuals. The detection of gene expressions and metabolic substances after drugs treatments in alc and normal individuals imply that silkworms and humans have a high similarity in the drugs metabolic features and the gene pathway related to BH4 and the dopamine biosynthesis. We propose that the alc mutant could be used as an animal model for drug evaluation for BH4-deficient PKU.Keywords: silkworm model, alc, PTPS, BH4, phenylketonuria",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5979516/,abstract

This increase is toxic to the growing brain. Objectives:The purpose of this study was to compare the intellectual and developmental status in HPA and PKU children with normal population in national screening program.Patients and Methods:In a historical cohort study, 41 PKU patients who had the inclusion criteria and 41 healthy children were evaluated. Wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence-3rd edition (WPPI-3) was used in order to assess the intellectual status of children 4 years and older and Ages and stages questionnaire (ASQ) was used to assess the developmental status of children 5 years and younger.Results:In intellectual test comparison, the two groups showed significant difference in Wechsler’s performance intelligence score and some performance subscales (P-value < 0.01). In comparison of developmental status, no significant difference was observed between the two groups (P-value > 0.05).Conclusions:Even with early diagnosis and treatment of PKU patients, these children show some deficiencies intellectually compared to normal children. This study emphasizes on necessity for screening intellectual and developmental status of PKU patients so that effective medical or educational measures can taken in case of deficiencies.Keywords: Hyperphenylalaninemia, PKU, Intelligence, Development",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4662839/,abstract

NBS Connect was launched in 2012 by Emory University after years of planning and grassroots work by professionals, consumers, and industry. Individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) or tyrosinemia (TYR) have been recruited through distribution of outreach materials, presentations at parent organization meetings and direct recruitment at clinic appointments. Participants complete online profiles generating data on diagnosis, treatment, symptoms, outcomes, barriers to care, and quality of life. Resources such as education materials, information on the latest research and clinical trials, recipes, interactive health tracking systems, and professional support tools are described. In addition, to examine the ability of NBS Connect to generate data that guides hypothesis-driven research, data pertaining to age at diagnosis, bone health, and skin conditions in individuals with PKU were assessed. The objective of this paper is to describe the development of NBS Connect and highlight its data, resources and research contributions.ResultsIn September 2016, NBS Connect had 442 registered participants: 314 (71%) individuals with PKU, 68 (15%) with MSUD, 20 (5%) with TYR, and 40 (9%) with other disorders on the NBS panel. Age at diagnosis was less than 4 weeks in 285 (89%) of 319 respondents to this question and between 1 month and 14 years in 29 (9%) individuals. Of 216 respondents with PKU, 33 (15%) had a DXA scan in the past year. Of 217 respondents with PKU, 99 (46%) reported at least one skin condition.ConclusionsNBS Connect was built and refined with feedback from all stakeholders, including individuals with inherited metabolic disorders. Based on patient-reported data, future studies can be initiated to test hypotheses such as the relationship between PKU and skin conditions. Patient registries like NBS Connect can inform hypothesis-driven research, contributing to knowledge generation and following the current trend in moving from traditional medicine towards evidence-based practice. NBS Connect will help clinicians understand long-term outcomes of rare disorders, contributing to better patient care and quality of life.Keywords: Patient registry, Newborn screening, Phenylketonuria, Maple syrup urine disease, Tyrosinemia, Metabolic disorders, NBS Connect",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5517813/,abstract

Capillary blood was spotted on filter paper by each subject and the DBS analyzed using both MS/MS and IEC. Plasma was isolated from venous blood and analyzed using IEC.ResultsBlood phe concentrations in DBS analyzed using MS/MS are 28% ± 1% (n = 110, p < 0.0001) lower than plasma phe concentrations analyzed using IEC resulting in a blood phe concentration of 514 ± 23 μmol/L and a plasma phe concentration of 731 ± 32 μmol/L (mean ± SEM). This discrepancy is larger when plasma phe is > 600 μmol/L. Due to the large variability across subjects of 13.2%, a calibration factor to adjust blood phe concentrations is not recommended. Analysis of DBS using IEC reduced the discrepancy to 15 ± 2% lower phe concentrations compared to plasma analyzed using IEC (n = 38, p = 0.0001). This suggests that a major contributor to the discrepancy in phe concentrations is the analytical method.ConclusionUse of DBS analyzed using MS/MS to monitor blood phe concentrations in individuals with PKU yields significantly lower phe levels compared to plasma phe levels analyzed using IEC. Optimization of current testing methodologies for measuring phe in DBS, along with patient education regarding the appropriate technique for spotting blood on filter paper is needed to improve the accuracy of using DBS to measure phe concentrations in PKU management.Abbreviations: PKU, phenylketonuria; pah, phenylalanine hydroxylase; phe, phenylalanine; AAA, amino acid analyzer; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; IEC, ion-exchange chromatography; tyr, tyrosine; DBS, dried blood spotKeywords: Bland–Altman, Amino acid analyzer, Phenylalanine analytical methods, Newborn screening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4789345/,abstract

In this study, we reviewed the antioxidant role of nutritional supplementation of selenium in the management of major chronic metabolic disorders, including hyperlipidaemia, hyperglycaemia, and hyperphenylalaninemia. Clinical significance of selenium deficiency in chronic metabolic diseases was elaborated, while clinical and experimental observations of dietary supplementation of selenium in treating chronic metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, arteriosclerosis, and phenylketonuria, were summarized. Toxicity and recommended dose of selenium were discussed. The mechanism of action was also proposed via inspecting the interaction of molecular networks and predicting target protein such as xanthine dehydrogenase in various diseases.

456,10.1021/bi500734h,25295853,"Go to:AbstractOpen in a separate windowThe
catalytic domains of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (AAAHs)
contain a non-heme iron coordinated to a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial
triad and two water molecules. Asp139 from Chromobacterium
violaceum PAH (cPAH) resides within the second coordination
sphere and contributes key hydrogen bonds with three active site waters
that mediate its interaction with an oxidized form of the cofactor,
7,8-dihydro-l-biopterin, in crystal structures. To determine
the catalytic role of this residue, various point mutants were prepared
and characterized. Our isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis
of iron binding implies that polarity at position 139 is not the sole
criterion for metal affinity, as binding studies with D139E suggest
that the size of the amino acid side chain also appears to be important.
High-resolution crystal structures of the mutants reveal that Asp139
may not be essential for holding the bridging water molecules together,
because many of these waters are retained even in the Ala mutant.
However, interactions via the bridging waters contribute to cofactor
binding at the active site, interactions for which charge of the residue
is important, as the D139N mutant shows a 5-fold decrease in its affinity
for pterin as revealed by ITC (compared to a 16-fold loss of affinity
in the case of the Ala mutant). The Asn and Ala mutants show a much
more pronounced defect in their kcat values,
with nearly 16- and 100-fold changes relative to that of the wild
type, respectively, indicating a substantial role of this residue
in stabilization of the transition state by aligning the cofactor
in a productive orientation, most likely through direct binding with
the cofactor, supported by data from molecular dynamics simulations
of the complexes. Our results indicate that the intervening water
structure between the cofactor and the acidic residue masks direct
interaction between the two, possibly to prevent uncoupled hydroxylation
of the cofactor before the arrival of phenylalanine. It thus appears
that the second-coordination sphere Asp residue in cPAH, and, by extrapolation,
the equivalent residue in other AAAHs, plays a role in fine-tuning
pterin affinity in the ground state via deformable interactions with
bridging waters and assumes a more significant role in the transition
state by aligning the cofactor through direct hydrogen bonding.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4222540/,abstract

However, the aetiological link between metabolic alteration and the observed diseases is still elusive. This includes the correlation between the abnormally high levels of homocysteine and quinolinic acid in Alzheimer's disease, as well as the accumulation of oncometabolites in malignant processes. Here, we suggest and discuss a possible mechanistic insight into metabolite accumulation in conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Our hypothesis is based on the demonstrated ability of metabolites to form amyloid-like structures in inborn error of metabolism disorders and the potential of such metabolite amyloids to promote protein aggregation. This notion can provide a new paradigm for neurodegeneration and cancer, as both conditions were linked to loss of function due to protein aggregation. Similar to the well-established observation of amyloid formation in many degenerative disorders, the formation of amyloids by tumour-suppressor proteins, including p53, was demonstrated in malignant states. Moreover, this new paradigm could fill the gap in understanding the high occurrence of specific types of cancer among genetic error of metabolism patients.

460,10.2147/PHMT.S85717,29388597,"Go to:AbstractAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically determined neurodevelopmental brain disorder presenting with restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, and activities, or persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction. ASD is characterized by many different clinical endophenotypes and is potentially linked with certain comorbidities. According to current recommendations, children with ASD are at risk of having alimentary tract disorders – mainly, they are at a greater risk of general gastrointestinal (GI) concerns, constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. GI symptoms may overlap with ASD core symptoms through different mechanisms. These mechanisms include multilevel pathways in the gut–brain axis contributing to alterations in behavior and cognition. Shared pathogenetic factors and pathophysiological mechanisms possibly linking ASD and GI disturbances, as shown by most recent studies, include intestinal inflammation with or without autoimmunity, immunoglobulin E-mediated and/or cell-mediated GI food allergies as well as gluten-related disorders (celiac disease, wheat allergy, non-celiac gluten sensitivity), visceral hypersensitivity linked with functional abdominal pain, and dysautonomia linked with GI dysmotility and gastroesophageal reflux. Dysregulation of the gut microbiome has also been shown to be involved in modulating GI functions with the ability to affect intestinal permeability, mucosal immune function, and intestinal motility and sensitivity. Metabolic activity of the microbiome and dietary components are currently suspected to be associated with alterations in behavior and cognition also in patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. All the above-listed GI factors may contribute to brain dysfunction and neuroinflammation depending upon an individual patient’s genetic vulnerability. Due to a possible clinical endophenotype presenting as comorbidity of ASD and GI disorders, we propose treating this situation as an “overlap syndrome”. Practical use of the concept of an overlap syndrome of ASD and GI disorders may help in identifying those children with ASD who suffer from an alimentary tract disease. Unexplained worsening of nonverbal behaviors (agitation, anxiety, aggression, self-injury, sleep deprivation) should alert professionals about this possibility. This may shorten the time to diagnosis and treatment commencement, and thereby alleviate both GI and ASD symptoms through reducing pain, stress, or discomfort. Furthermore, this may also protect children against unnecessary dietary experiments and restrictions that have no medical indications. A personalized approach to each patient is necessary.

Recently, PAH exon 11 was identified as a vulnerable exon due to a weak 3’ splice site, with different exonic mutations affecting exon 11 splicing through disruption of exonic splicing regulatory elements. In this study, we report a novel intron 11 regulatory element, which is involved in exon 11 splicing, as revealed by the investigated pathogenic effect of variants c.1199+17G>A and c.1199+20G>C, identified in PKU patients. Both mutations cause exon 11 skipping in a minigene system. RNA binding assays indicate that binding of U1snRNP70 to this intronic region is disrupted, concomitant with a slightly increased binding of inhibitors hnRNPA1/2. We have investigated the effect of deletions and point mutations, as well as overexpression of adapted U1snRNA to show that this splicing regulatory motif is important for regulation of correct splicing at the natural 5’ splice site. The results indicate that U1snRNP binding downstream of the natural 5’ splice site determines efficient exon 11 splicing, thus providing a basis for development of therapeutic strategies to correct PAH exon 11 splicing mutations. In this work, we expand the functional effects of non-canonical intronic U1 snRNP binding by showing that it may enhance exon definition and that, consequently, intronic mutations may cause exon skipping by a novel mechanism, where they disrupt stimulatory U1 snRNP binding close to the 5’ splice site.

Given the large number of conditions that can be screened, the implementation of expanded carrier screening using genome sequencing will require practical methods of simplifying decisions about the conditions for which patients want to be screened. One method to simplify decision making is to generate a taxonomy based on expert judgment. However, expert perceptions of condition attributes used to classify these conditions may differ from those used by patients. To understand whether expert and patient perceptions differ, we asked women who had received preconception genetic carrier screening in the last 3 years to fill out a survey to rate the attributes (predictability, controllability, visibility, and severity) of several autosomal recessive or X-linked genetic conditions. These conditions were classified into one of five taxonomy categories developed by subject experts (significantly shortened lifespan, serious medical problems, mild medical problems, unpredictable medical outcomes, and adult-onset conditions). A total of 193 women provided 739 usable ratings across 20 conditions. The mean ratings and correlations demonstrated that participants made distinctions across both attributes and categories. Aggregated mean attribute ratings across categories demonstrated logical consistency between the key features of each attribute and category, although participants perceived little difference between the mild and serious categories.

To learn what is already known about these views, we conducted a systematic review, which ultimately analyzed 53 studies involving the perspectives of 47,974 participants on real or hypothetical privacy issues related to human genetic data. Bibliographic databases included MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, and Sociological Abstracts. Three investigators independently screened studies against predetermined criteria and assessed risk of bias. The picture of genetic privacy that emerges from this systematic literature review is complex and riddled with gaps. When asked specifically “are you worried about genetic privacy,” the general public, patients, and professionals frequently said yes. In many cases, however, that question was posed poorly or only in the most general terms. While many participants expressed concern that genomic and medical information would be revealed to others, respondents frequently seemed to conflate privacy, confidentiality, control, and security. People varied widely in how much control they wanted over the use of data. They were more concerned about use by employers, insurers, and the government than they were about researchers and commercial entities. In addition, people are often willing to give up some privacy to obtain other goods. Importantly, little attention was paid to understanding the factors–sociocultural, relational, and media—that influence people’s opinions and decisions. Future investigations should explore in greater depth which concerns about genetic privacy are most salient to people and the social forces and contexts that influence those perceptions.

The study also included 45 patients aged ≥20.ResultsOur study demonstrated that only 45% (n = 74) of PKU patients knew daily Phe intake recommendations, 27% of patients (n = 41) knew the Phe content in a minimum of three out of four researched food products. Patients’ knowledge concerning Phe intake (p = 0.0181) and the knowledge of selected food products (p = 0.041819) improved with age. We did not establish such a correlation in the group of PKU children’s parents.Approximately 31% of patients and 22% of parents reported helplessness, which increased with the child’s age, associated with the necessity to adhere to the diet; 30% of patients reported feeling ashamed of the fact that they could not eat all food products. Regardless of age, children were more likely than parents to report helplessness (p = 0.032005).Among patients, 41.40% declared that they would wish to select products unassisted but their parents did not permit them to do so. The question of whether parents teach children self-reliance in meal preparation was answered affirmatively by 98% of parents and only 81% of children (p = 0.0001).ConclusionOur data demonstrated that parents’ and children’s knowledge concerning treatment recommendations and food products does not have a direct impact on attitude to the PKU diet. Limiting children’s independence in meal selection, growing helplessness in the face of dietary adherence and shame resulting from the necessity to follow a different diet observed in PKU families are responsible for shaping and perpetuating a consistently negative attitude to the diet.

Analyses were exploratory, performed post-hoc on data collected primarily to validate the PKU-QOL.MethodsA multicentre, prospective, non-interventional, observational study conducted in France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and the UK. Patients diagnosed with PKU aged ≥9 years old and treated with a Phe-restricted diet and/or Phe-free amino acid protein supplements and/or pharmacological therapy were included in the study; parents of at least one patient with PKU aged <18 years were also included. HRQoL was assessed by generic measures (Pediatric Quality-of-Life Inventory; Medical Outcome Survey 36 item Short Form; Child Health Questionnaire 28 item Parent Form) and the newly developed PKU-QOL. Mean generic domain scores were interpreted using published reference values from the general population. PKU-QOL domain scores were described overall and in different subgroups of patients defined according to severity of PKU, overall assessment of patient’s health status by the investigator and treatment with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).ResultsData from 559 subjects were analysed: 306 patients (92 children, 110 adolescents, 104 adults) and 253 parents. Mean domain scores of generic measures in the study were comparable to the general population. The highest PKU-QOL impact scores (indicating greater impact) were for emotional impact of PKU, anxiety about blood Phe levels, guilt regarding poor adherence to dietary restrictions or Phe-free amino acid supplement intake and anxiety regarding blood Phe levels during pregnancy. Patients with mild/moderate PKU and those receiving BH4 reported lower practical and emotional impacts of the diet and Phe-free amino acid supplement intake.ConclusionPatients with PKU showed good HRQoL in the study, both with the generic and PKU-specific measures.

Background: Molecular imprinting is a method for synthesizing polymers with structure-selective adsorption properties with applications such as, selectivity binding, drug delivery systems and anti-bodies. The present study aims at optimizing the preparation of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) against l-phenylalanine, in order to increase phenylalanine-binding in Enzymatic Intestinal Simulated Fluid (ESIF).

Methods: The MIP for l-phenylalanine, as a water-soluble template, was successfully synthesized without derivatization. Synthesization was done by a UV polymerization method in which methacrylic acid (MAA), as a functional monomer, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), as a cross-linker, were used in the presence of five different porogenic solvents including; acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform, toluene and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The selectivity of the MIP was examined using 19 different amino acids in human serum and was evaluated by HPLC. In addition, morphological studies were conducted using SEM.

Results: The results showed that the obtained MIP with acetonitrile had the highest capacity and selectivity compared with other solvents. The data indicated that Phe-binding to MIP was significantly more than the former binding to NIP in EISF (P≤0.05). Moreover, in comparison with NIP and control group, MIP showed a better selectivity and binding for Phe. This could be used for the reduction of Phe in human serum samples of Phenylketonuria.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the MIP against Phe prepared with acetonitrile, showed a good selectivity and binding, which caused a reduction of blood Phe concentration in enzymatic simulated intestinal fluid and human serum sample of Phenylketonuria.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and carnitine are anti-inflammatory molecules and their deficiency may result in GI inflammation. The relationship between the increased frequency of GI manifestations and reduced levels of PUFAs and carnitine was not previously investigated in autistic patients. This study was the first to investigate plasma levels of PUFAs and serum carnitine in relation to GI manifestations in autistic children.MethodsPlasma levels of PUFAs (including linoleic, alphalinolenic, arachidonic “AA” and docosahexaenoic “DHA” acids) and serum carnitine were measured in 100 autistic children and 100 healthy-matched children.ResultsReduced levels of serum carnitine and plasma DHA, AA, linolenic and linoleic acids were found in 66%, 62%, 60%, 43% and 38%, respectively of autistic children. On the other hand, 54% of autistic patients had elevated ω6/ω3 ratio. Autistic patients with GI manifestations (48%) had significantly decreased levels of serum carnitine and plasma DHA than patients without such manifestations. In addition, autistic patients with GI manifestations had significantly increased percentage of reduced serum carnitine (91.7%) and plasma DHA levels (87.5%) than patients without such manifestations (42.3% and 38.5%, respectively), (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001%, respectively).ConclusionsReduced levels of plasma DHA and serum carnitine levels may be associated with the GI problems in some autistic patients. However, this is an initial report, studies are recommended to invesigate whether reduced levels of carnitine and DHA are a mere association or have a pathogenic role in GI problems in autistic patients.Keywords: Autism, Brain energy, Carnitine, Docosahexaenoic acid, Gastrointestinal manifestations, Polyunsaturated fatty acids",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4332725/,abstract

It includes a broad range of early onset neurodevelopmental disorders affecting more than 10% of children before 5 years of age. ESSENCE includes among others attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Some degree of disability is the rule rather than the exception. The causes are heterogeneous ranging from extreme social deprivation, pre- and perinatal risk factors, genetic and metabolic diseases, immune and infectious disorders, nutritional factors, physical trauma, and postnatal toxic and environmental factors (and combinations/interactions of some or several of these). Treatments often involve a combination of psychoeducational interventions, home- and school-based programmes, and medication. Here, I will first briefly review our main knowledge on the biological pathways associated with early onset neurodevelopmental disorders and will provide useful links to be informed of the progress in the field. Five main pathways are associated with ASD and ID: chromatin remodelling, cytoskeleton dynamics, mRNA translation, metabolism and synapse formation/function. I will then detail three propositions coming from institutions, researchers and/or communities of patients and families to foster research: 1) to use more dimensional and quantitative data than diagnostic categories; 2) to increase data sharing and research on genetic and brain diversity in human populations; 3) to involve patients and relatives as participants for research.

Due to a key role in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid, one of the most important precursors of immunity mediators, fatty acid desaturase (FADS) genes could have an important impact in the development of type 2 diabetes.Materials and Methods:This study aimed to determine the relationship between polymorphisms rs174537 in FADS1 gene and rs174575 in FADS2 gene with type 2 diabetes in Iranian population. After extracting genomic DNA, the locations of mutations and allele types were identified with high-resolution melting (HRM)-polymerase chain reaction method. Then, association between these mutations with metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes was investigated using χ2 correlation coefficients for variables and logistic regression.Results:The results showed that among 50 diabetic participants, 68% of patients have the mutant allele for rs174537 in FADS1 gene. This rate is 26% for rs174575 in FADS2 gene. Based on the results, it seems that participants having rs174537 mutant allele are more prone to become diabetic but it has a beneficial effect on total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and participants having rs174575 mutant are less prone to become diabetic, and also, it leads to higher triglycerides and body mass index (obesity).Conclusions:Detecting FADS1 and FADS2, gene polymorphisms using HRM can be an anticipating tool for making decision on initiating lifestyle modifications to prevent type 2 diabetes.Keywords: Fatty acid desaturase gene, polymorphism, type 2 diabetic",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6036782/,abstract

When compared to a T2D rat model, HIP hearts uniquely had significant DECREASES in five amino acids (lysine, alanine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, serine), with phenylalanine decreased across all four tissues investigated, including plasma. In contrast, significantly INCREASED circulating phenylalanine is reported in diabetics in multiple recent studies.ConclusionDECREASED phenylalanine may serve as a unique marker of cardiac and brain dysfunction due to hyperamylinemia that can be differentiated from alterations in T2D in the plasma. While the deficiency in phenylalanine was seen across tissues including plasma and could be monitored, reduced tyrosine was seen only in the brain.

The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of GMP administration on DNCB-induced AD in rats. The severity of inflammatory process, pruritus, production of cytokines, and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) content were measured, and the histopathological features were analyzed. GMP reduced the intensity of inflammatory process and edema of DNCB-induced dermatitis, with a significant decrease in eosinophils recruitment and mast cells hyperplasia. In addition GMP suppressed the serum levels of total IgE and IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 expression in AD-lesions. Besides, the levels of IL-10 were significantly increased. Remarkably, GMP administration before AD-induction abolished pruritus in dermatitis-like reactions in the rats.

A successful way to better understand complex interactions in biomedical systems is to employ collective relational learning approaches that can jointly model diverse relationships present in multiplex data. We propose a novel collective pairwise classification approach for multi-way data analysis. Our model leverages the superiority of latent factor models and classifies relationships in a large relational data domain using a pairwise ranking loss. In contrast to current approaches, our method estimates probabilities, such that probabilities for existing relationships are higher than for assumed-to-be-negative relationships. Although our method bears correspondence with the maximization of non-differentiable area under the ROC curve, we were able to design a learning algorithm that scales well on multi-relational data encoding interactions between thousands of entities. We use the new method to infer relationships from multiplex drug data and to predict connections between clinical manifestations of diseases and their underlying molecular signatures. Our method achieves promising predictive performance when compared to state-of-the-art alternative approaches and can make “category-jumping” predictions about diseases from genomic and clinical data generated far outside the molecular context.Keywords: Collective classification, multi-relational learning, three-way model, drug-drug interactions, drug-target interactions, symptoms-disease network, gene-disease network",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4719585/,abstract

This study aimed to update the recommendations for the clinical management and follow-up of newborns with neonatal risk factors of hearing loss for the newborn screening programme in Belgium.MethodsA literature review was performed, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system assessment method was used to determine the level of evidence quality and strength of the recommendation for each risk factor. The state of scientific knowledge, levels of evidence quality, and graded recommendations were subsequently assessed using a three-round Delphi consensus process (two online questionnaires and one face-to-face meeting).ResultsCongenital infections (i.e., cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis), a family history of hearing loss, consanguinity in (grand)parents, malformation syndromes, and foetal alcohol syndrome presented a ‘high’ level of evidence quality as neonatal risk factors for hearing loss. Because of the sensitivity of auditory function to bilirubin toxicity, hyperbilirubinaemia was assessed at a ‘moderate’ level of evidence quality. In contrast, a very low birth weight, low Apgar score, and hospitalisation in the neonatal intensive care unit ranged from ‘very low’ to ‘low’ levels, and ototoxic drugs were evidenced as ‘very low’. Possible explanations for these ‘very low’ and ‘low’ levels include the improved management of these health conditions or treatments, and methodological weaknesses such as confounding effects, which make it difficult to conclude on individual risk factors. In the recommendation statements, the experts emphasised avoiding unidentified neonatal hearing loss and opted to include risk factors for hearing loss even in cases with weak evidence. The panel also highlighted the cumulative effect of risk factors for hearing loss.ConclusionsWe revised the recommendations for the clinical management and follow-up of newborns exhibiting neonatal risk factors for hearing loss on the basis of the aforementioned evidence-based approach and clinical experience from experts.

A. baumannii possesses an adaptable physiology, seen not only in its antibiotic resistance and virulence phenotypes but also in its metabolic versatility. In this study, we observed that A. baumannii undergoes global transcriptional changes in response to human pleural fluid (PF), a key host-derived environmental signal. Differential gene expression analyses combined with experimental approaches revealed changes in A. baumannii metabolism, affecting cytotoxicity, persistence, bacterial killing, and chemotaxis. Over 1,220 genes representing 55% of the differentially expressed transcriptomic data corresponded to metabolic processes, including the upregulation of glutamate, short chain fatty acid, and styrene metabolism. We observed an upregulation by 1.83- and 2.61-fold of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex subunits E3 and E2, respectively. We also found that pyruvate (PYR), in conjunction with PF, triggers an A. baumannii pathogenic behavior that adversely impacts human epithelial cell viability. Interestingly, PF also amplified A. baumannii cytotoxicity against murine macrophages, suggesting an immune evasion strategy implemented by A. baumannii. Moreover, we uncovered opposing metabolic strategies dependent on the degree of pathogenicity of the strains, where less pathogenic strains demonstrated greater utilization of PYR to promote persister formation in the presence of PF. Additionally, our transcriptomic analysis and growth studies of A. baumannii suggest the existence of an alternative phenylalanine (PA) catabolic route independent of the phenylacetic acid pathway, which converts PA to phenylpyruvate (PP) and shuttles intermediates into styrene metabolism. This alternative route promoted a neutrophil-evasive state, as PF-induced degradation of PP significantly reduced overall human neutrophil chemotaxis in ex vivo chemotactic assays.

Melatonin affects by four mechanisms: 1) Binding to melatonin receptors in plasma membrane, 2) Binding to intracellular proteins such as calmoduline, 3) Binding to Orphan nuclear receptors, and 4) Antioxidant effect. Receptors associated with melatonin are as follows: 1) Melatonin receptor type 1a: MT1 (on cell membrane), 2) Melatonin receptor type 1b: MT2 (on cell membrane), 3) Melatonin receptor type 1c (found in fish, amphibians and birds), 4) Quinone reductase 2 enzyme (MT3 receptor, a detoxification enzyme), 5) RZR/RORα: Retinoid-related Orphan nuclear hormone receptor (with this receptor, melatonin binds to the transcription factors in nucleus), and 6) GPR50: X-linked Melatonin-related Orphan receptor (it is effective in binding of melatonin to MT1). Melatonin agonists such as ramelteon, agomelatine, circadin, TIK-301 and tasimelteon are introduced and side effects will be discussed. In conclusion, melatonin and related drugs is a new and promising era for medicine. Melatonin receptors and melatonin drugs will take attention with greater interest day by day in the future.Keywords: Melatonin, receptors, agonists, pineal gland",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4970552/,abstract

We evaluated the potential contribution of tryptophan-derived bacterial metabolites to body weight gain. The study comprised three experimental series performed on separate groups of male, Sprague-Dawley rats: (i) rats on standard laboratory diet treated with water solution of neomycin, an antibiotic, or tap water (controls-1); (ii) rats on standard diet (controls-2) or tryptophan-high (TH) or tryptophan-free (TF) diet; and (iii) rats treated with indole-3-propionic acid (I3P), a bacterial metabolite of tryptophan, or a vehicle (controls-3). (i) Rats treated with neomycin showed a significantly higher weight gain but lower stool and blood concentration of I3P than controls-1. (ii) The TH group showed significantly smaller increases in body weight but higher stool and plasma concentration of I3P than controls-2. In contrast, the TF group showed a decrease in body weight, decreased total serum protein and a significant increase in urine output. (iii) Rats treated with I3P showed significantly smaller weight gain than controls-3. Our study suggests that I3P, a gut bacteria metabolite of tryptophan, contributes to changes in body weight gain produced by antibiotics and tryptophan-rich diet.Keywords: indoles, metabolism, microbiota, tryptophan, weight gain",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6471155/,abstract

Primary objectives were to determine early predictors of autism risk to identify children with TSC in most need of early interventions. The Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI) was evaluated as a measure of ASD-associated behaviors in infants with TSC at age 12 months and its ability to predict ASD at 24 months.MethodsChildren ages 0 to 36 months with TSC were enrolled in the TSC Autism Center of Excellence Research Network (TACERN), a multicenter, prospective observational study to identify biomarkers of ASD. The AOSI was administered at age 12 months and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) at 24 months. Developmental functioning was assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Children were classified as ASD or non-ASD according to the ADOS-2.ResultsAnalysis included 79 children who had been administered the AOSI at 12 months and ADOS-2 and ADI-R at 24 months. The ASD group had a mean AOSI total score at 12 months significantly higher than the non-ASD group (11.8 ± 7.4 vs. 6.3 ± 4.7; p<0.001). An AOSI total score cut-off of 13 provided a specificity of 0.89 to detect ASD with the ADOS-2. AOSI total score at 12 months was similarly associated with exceeding cut-off scores on the ADI-R.ConclusionsThe AOSI is a useful clinical tool in determining which infants with TSC are at increased risk for developing ASD.Keywords: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, autism spectrum disorder, Autism Observational Scale for Infants, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, infants, toddlers",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5610103/,abstract

Direct DNA sequencing was used to analyze the all of the exons in the PAH gene, including the promoter and flanking intron regions, in another 15 PKU patients. Our results indicated that, 30 different mutation types were identified in all 122 PAH alleles, with the mutation detection rate of 78.7% (96/122). Four novel mutations, i.e., 5’-Flanking -626G>A, 5’-Flanking -480DelACT, S196fsX4, and IVS8+1G>C, were identified for the first time. Similar to other regions in North China, R243Q, EX6-96A>G, IVS4-1A>G, R111X, and Y356X were the most prevalent PAH mutations in PKU patients from Xinjiang. Additionally, common mutations showed different frequencies in Xinjiang, when compared to other areas. Furthermore, sixteen different PAH gene mutation types were identified for the first time in the minorities in Xinjiang.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the cardiovascular phenotype in adult patients with PKU by clinical and dietary data, measurements of biochemical markers, and non-invasive examination of vascular functions.ResultsTwenty-three adult patients with PKU (age: 18–47 y; 30.8 ± 8.4 y) and 28 healthy controls (age: 18–47 y; 30.1 ± 9.1 y) were included in this study. PKU patients had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, increased resting heart rate and a higher body mass index. Total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol levels were significantly increased in PKU patients, whereas plasma levels of HDL cholesterol and its subfraction HDL2 (but not HDL3) were significantly decreased. The inflammatory markers C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A protein and the serum oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde were significantly higher in patients with PKU. Venous occlusion plethysmography showed marked reduction in post-ischemic blood flow and the carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity was significantly increased demonstrating endothelial dysfunction and increased vascular stiffness.ConclusionsThis study shows that the cardiovascular phenotype of adult PKU patients is characterized by an accumulation of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, high levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, endothelial dysfunction and vascular stiffness.

Recently, genome-wide association studies have implicated HNF1A as a susceptibility gene for pancreatic cancer. However, the functional significance and molecular mechanism of HNF1A in pancreatic carcinogenesis remains unclear.MethodsUsing RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry methods, we examined HNF1A gene expression in eight pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and in paired tumor and normal tissue samples from patients with resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We knocked down the HNF1A gene expression in two cancer cell lines using three siRNA sequences. The impacts on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle as well as the phosphorylation of Akt signaling transduction proteins were examined using ATP assay, flow cytometry and Western blot.Results
HNF1A was expressed in three out of eight pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines and the level of HNF1A mRNA and protein expression was significantly lower in tumors than in normal adjacent tissues by both RT-PCR and Western Blot analyses. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the level of HNF1A expression was significantly lower in tumor tissues than in non-tumor tissues. Selective blocking of HNF1A by specific siRNA conferred a 2-fold higher rate of cell proliferation, 20% increased S phase and G2 phase cells, and 30-40% reduced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell lines. We further demonstrated that HNF1A knockdown activated Akt and its downstream target, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in pancreatic cancer cells.ConclusionThese observations provide experimental evidence supporting a possible tumor suppressor role of HNF1A in pancreatic cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4368635/,abstract

There are at least 346 disease-causing variants in the CFTR gene, but effective small-molecule therapies exist for only ~10% of them. One option to treat all mutations is CFTR cDNA-based therapy, but clinical trials to date have only been able to stabilise rather than improve lung function disease in patients. While cDNA-based therapy is already a clinical reality for a number of diseases, some animal studies have clearly established that precision genome editing can be significantly more effective than cDNA addition. These observations have led to a number of gene-editing clinical trials for a small number of such genetic disorders. To date, gene-editing strategies to correct CFTR mutations have been conducted exclusively in cell models, with no in vivo gene-editing studies yet described. Here, we highlight some of the key breakthroughs in in vivo and ex vivo gene and base editing in animal models for other diseases and discuss what might be learned from these studies in the development of editing strategies that may be applied to cystic fibrosis as a potential therapeutic approach. There are many hurdles that need to be overcome, including the in vivo delivery of editing machinery or successful engraftment of ex vivo-edited cells, as well as minimising potential off-target effects.

In 2005, the authors published practical guidelines operationalizing the Institute of Medicine categories, allowing for standardization of FASD diagnoses in clinical settings. The purpose of the current report is to present updated diagnostic guidelines based on a thorough review of the literature and the authors’ combined expertise based on the evaluation of >10 000 children for potential FASD in clinical settings and in epidemiologic studies in conjunction with National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism–funded studies, the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, and the Collaboration on FASD Prevalence. The guidelines were formulated through conference calls and meetings held at National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism offices in Rockville, MD. Specific areas addressed include the following: precise definition of documented prenatal alcohol exposure; neurobehavioral criteria for diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome, partial fetal alcohol syndrome, and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder; revised diagnostic criteria for alcohol-related birth defects; an updated comprehensive research dysmorphology scoring system; and a new lip/philtrum guide for the white population, incorporating a 45-degree view.

The goal of this study was: (i) to determine if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that associate with blood pressure variation, identified in large studies, are applicable to blood pressure control in subjects from a rural population; (ii) to measure the association of these SNPs with subjects’ responsiveness to the hypertension intervention; and (iii) to identify other SNPs that may help understand patient-specific responses to an intervention. We used a combination of candidate SNPs and genome-wide analyses to test associations with either baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) or change in systolic blood pressure one year after the intervention in two genetically defined ancestral groups: African Americans (AA) and Caucasian Americans (CAU). Of the 48 candidate SNPs, 13 SNPs associated with baseline SBP in our study; however, one candidate SNP, rs592582, also associated with a change in SBP after one year. Using our study data, we identified 4 and 15 additional loci that associated with a change in SBP in the AA and CAU groups, respectively. Our analysis of gene-age interactions identified genotypes associated with SBP improvement within different age groups of our populations. Moreover, our integrative analysis identified AQP4-AS1 and PADI2 as genes whose expression levels may contribute to the pleiotropy of complex traits involved in cardiovascular health and blood pressure regulation in response to an intervention targeting hypertension. In conclusion, the identification of SNPs associated with the success of a hypertension treatment intervention suggests that genetic factors in combination with age may contribute to an individual’s success in lowering SBP. If these findings prove to be applicable to other populations, the use of this genetic variation in making patient-specific interventions may help providers with making decisions to improve patient outcomes. Further investigation is required to determine the role of this genetic variance with respect to the management of hypertension such that more precise treatment recommendations may be made in the future as part of personalized medicine.Keywords: hypertension, GWAS, precision medicine, rural population, SNP-age interaction",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023309/,abstract

As proposed by the triage theory, a modest deficiency of one of the nutrients/cofactors triggers a built-in rationing mechanism that favors the proteins needed for immediate survival and reproduction (survival proteins) while sacrificing those needed to protect against future damage (longevity proteins). Impairment of the function of longevity proteins results in an insidious acceleration of the risk of diseases associated with aging. I also propose that nutrients required for the function of longevity proteins constitute a class of vitamins that are here named “longevity vitamins.” I suggest that many such nutrients play a dual role for both survival and longevity. The evidence for classifying taurine as a conditional vitamin, and the following 10 compounds as putative longevity vitamins, is reviewed: the fungal antioxidant ergothioneine; the bacterial metabolites pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and queuine; and the plant antioxidant carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, α- and β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and the marine carotenoid astaxanthin.

This PKU diet seems to reduce atherogenesis and confer protection against cardiovascular diseases but the results from the few published studies have been inconclusive. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between the lipid profile and several treatment-related risk factors in patients with hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in order to optimize their monitoring.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional multicentre study. A total of 141 patients with HPA were classified according to age, phenotype, type of treatment and dietary adherence. Annual median blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels, Phe tolerance, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure (BP) and biochemical parameters [(triglycerides, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein A (ApoA), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), vitamin B12, total homocysteine (tHcy), Methionine (Met), high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP)] were collected for each patient.ResultsPlasma TC levels were lower in patients with PKU than in the mild-HPA group (150 ± 31 vs. 164 ± 22 mg/dL), and there was a weak inverse correlation between plasma TC and Phe levels. HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoA and ApoB levels were lower in the PKU group than in mild-HPA. Patients with PKU had higher systolic BP than the mild-HPA group and there was found a quadratic correlation between median Phe levels and systolic BP (p = 6.42e-5) and a linear correlation between median Phe levels and diastolic BP (p = 5.65e-4). In overweight or obese PKU patients (24.11 %), biochemical parameters such as TC, triglycerides, LDL-C, tHcy, hsCRP and BP were higher. By contrast, HDL-C was lower in these patients.ConclusionOur data show a direct correlation between lipid profile parameters and good adherence to the diet in PKU patients. However, lipid profile in overweight or obese patients displayed an atherogenic profile, in addition to higher hsCRP concentrations and BP.

We seek here to improve prediction of BH4-responsiveness through comparison of genotypes, BH4-loading test, predictions of responsiveness according to the literature and types and locations of mutations.MethodsA total of 364 French patients among which, 9 % had mild hyperphenylalaninemia, 17.7 % mild phenylketonuria and 73.1 % classical phenylketonuria, benefited from a 24-hour BH4-loading test and had the PAH gene sequenced and analyzed by Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification.ResultsOverall, 31.6 % of patients were BH4-responsive. The number of different mutations found was 127, including 26 new mutations. The mutations c.434A > T, c.500A > T, c.529G > C, c.1045 T > G and c.1196 T > C were newly classified as being BH4-responsive. We identified 261 genotypes, among which 46 were newly recognized as being BH4-responsive. Even though patients carry 2 responsive alleles, BH4-responsiveness cannot be predicted with certainty unless they present mild hyperphenylalaninemia. BH4-responsiveness cannot be predicted in patients carrying one responsive mutation only. In general, the milder the phenotype is, the stronger the BH4-response is. Almost exclusively missense mutations, particularly in exons 12, 11 and 8, are associated with BH4-responsiveness and any other type of mutation predicts a negative response.ConclusionsThis study is the first of its kind, in a French population, to identify the phenotype associated with several combinations of PAH mutations. As others, it highlights the necessity of performing simultaneously BH4 loading test and molecular analysis in monitoring phenylketonuria patients.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13023-015-0375-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, Tetrahydrobiopterin, BH4-loading test, Genotype, BH4-responsiveness",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5024853/,abstract

Dietary meat restriction attenuates carnitine-to-TMAO conversion, suggesting that TMAO production may not occur in meat-restricted individuals taking supplemental l-carnitine, but this has not been tested. Here, we mine a metabolomic dataset to assess TMAO levels in patients with diverse IEMs, including organic acidemias. These data were correlated with clinical information and confirmed using a quantitative TMAO assay. Marked plasma TMAO elevations were detected in patients treated with supplemental l-carnitine, including those on a meat-free diet. On average, patients with an organic acidemia had ~45-fold elevated [TMAO], as compared to the reference population. This effect was mitigated by metronidazole therapy lasting 7 days each month. Collectively, our data show that TMAO production occurs at high levels in patients with IEMs receiving oral l-carnitine.

A multiplatform approach combining HPLC‐MS and ultra‐performance LC‐MS, GC‐MS, CE‐MS, and 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to comprehensively characterize metabolic profiles from seventy BM samples. A total of 710 metabolites spanning multiple molecular classes were defined. The utility of the individual and combined analytical platforms was explored in relation to numbers of metabolites identified, as well as the reproducibility of the methods. The greatest number of metabolites was identified by the single phase HPLC‐MS method, while CE‐MS uniquely profiled amino acids in detail and NMR was the most reproducible, whereas GC‐MS targeted volatile compounds and short chain fatty acids. Dynamic changes in BM composition were characterized over the first 3 months of lactation. Metabolites identified as altering in abundance over lactation included fucose, di‐ and triacylglycerols, and short chain fatty acids, known to be important for infant immunological, neurological, and gastrointestinal development, as well as being an important source of energy. This extensive metabolic coverage of the dynamic BM metabolome provides a baseline for investigating the impact of maternal characteristics, as well as establishing the impact of environmental and dietary factors on the composition of BM, with a focus on the downstream health consequences this may have for infants.Keywords: Breast milk, Metabolomics, Metabonomics, MS, NMR",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4744768/,abstract

When implemented in high-poverty, urban elementary schools serving primarily Black and Latino children, it has been found to yield benefits in childhood across domains of academic achievement, behavior problems, and obesity. However, its long-term cost-effectiveness is unknown.MethodsWe determined the cost-effectiveness of ParentCorps in high-poverty, urban schools using a Markov Model projecting the long-term impact of ParentCorps compared to standard pre-kindergarten programming. We measured costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) resulting from the development of three disease states (i.e., drug abuse, obesity, and diabetes); from the health sequelae of these disease states; from graduation from high school; from interaction with the judiciary system; and opportunity costs of unemployment with a lifetime time horizon. The model was built, and analyses were performed in 2015–2016.ResultsParentCorps was estimated to save $4387 per individual and increase each individual’s quality adjusted life expectancy by 0.27 QALYs. These benefits were primarily due to the impact of ParentCorps on childhood obesity and the subsequent predicted prevention of diabetes, and ParentCorps’ impact on childhood behavior problems and the subsequent predicted prevention of interaction with the judiciary system and unemployment. Results were robust on sensitivity analyses, with ParentCorps remaining cost saving and health generating under nearly all assumptions, except when schools had very small pre-kindergarten programs.ConclusionsEffective family-centered interventions early in life such as ParentCorps that impact academic, behavioral and health outcomes among children attending high-poverty, urban schools have the potential to result in longer-term health benefits and substantial cost savings.Keywords: Markov model, ParentCorps, Childhood, Obesity, Behavior problems",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5635549/,abstract

Still, differences exist on target blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations for children with PKU in different countries and treatment centers. For the first time, long-term metabolic control and child development and cognitive functioning is compared between children with mean phenylalanine concentrations under 240 μmol/L (group A), between 240 and 360 μmol/L (group B) or over 360 μmol/L (group C) during their first year of life. METHODS: 70 patients diagnosed with PKU through neonatal screening with Phe > 900 μmol/L, were divided into 3 groups: A, B and C, according to mean Phe concentrations and standard deviation (SD). Metabolic control during childhood, psychomotor development and IQ were compared. RESULTS: In group A, Phe was maintained within the recommended range until 6 years of age, in Group B, until 3 years of age, and in group C, Phe was always over the recommended range. No significant differences were found between the three groups in mental development index (MDI) and motor development index (PDI) scores at 12, 24, and 30 months of age, but group C had the lowest scores on MDI at all age periods. At preschool and school age, IQ was higher in group A compared to group C.

Very often lead compounds do not succeed because of an apparent low potency in cell assays, despite an excellent performance in primary screening. Primary and secondary screenings differ significantly according to the conditions and challenges the compounds must overcome in order to interact with their intended target. Cellular internalization and intracellular metabolism are some of the difficulties the compounds must confront and different strategies can be envisaged for minimizing that problem. Using a novel screening procedure we have identified 15 compounds inhibiting the hepatitis C NS3 protease in an allosteric fashion. After characterizing biophysically the interaction with the target, some of the compounds were not able to inhibit viral replication in cell assays. In order to overcome this obstacle and potentially improve cellular internalization three of these compounds were complexed with γ-cyclodextrin. Two of them showed a five- and 16-fold activity increase, compared to their activity when delivered as free compounds in solution (while γ-cyclodextrin did not show antiviral activity by itself). The most remarkable result came from a third compound that showed no antiviral activity in cell assays when delivered free in solution, but its γ-cyclodextrin complex exhibited a 50% effective concentration of 5 μM. Thus, the antiviral activity of these compounds can be significantly improved, even completely rescued, using γ-cyclodextrin as carrier molecule.Keywords: primary and secondary screenings, drug activity, antiviral compounds, cyclodextrins, vehiculization, drug delivery, hepatitis C, NS3 protease, virus replicon system",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4371900/,abstract

Targeting risk factors should serve the goal of prevention and treatment intervention. Risk, however, is but one of the aspects of liability to a disorder, a latent trait that encompasses effects of all factors leading to or from the diagnostic threshold. The coequal but opposite aspect of liability is resistance to a disorder. The factors that increase resistance and thus enable prevention or recovery may differ from those that elevate risk. Accordingly, there are nontrivial differences between research perspectives that focus on risk and on resistance. This article shows how this distinction translates into goals and methods of research and practice, from the choice of potential mechanisms tested to the results sought in intervention. The resistance concept also differs from those of “resilience” and “protective factors,” subsuming but not limited to them. The implications of the concept are discussed using substance use disorder as an example and substantiate the need for biomedical research and its translation to shift to the resistance perspective.Keywords: Resilience, Protective factors, Research paradigm, Phenotype measurement, Malleability",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4807197/,abstract

QS was effective for determining the frequencies of resistance alleles on a population basis, which corresponded to 12 nonsynonymous point mutations associated with target-site resistance to five types of acaricides [organophosphates (monocrotophos, pirimiphos-methyl, dimethoate and chlorpyrifos), pyrethroids (fenpropathrin and bifenthrin), abamectin, bifenazate and etoxazole]. Most field-collected mites exhibited high levels of multiple resistance, as determined by RCV and QS data, suggesting the seriousness of their current acaricide resistance status in rose cultivation areas in Korea. The correlation analyses revealed moderate to high levels of positive relationships between the resistance allele frequencies and the actual resistance levels in only five of the acaricides evaluated, which limits the general application of allele frequency as a direct indicator for estimating actual resistance levels. Nevertheless, the resistance allele frequency data alone allowed for the evaluation of the genetic resistance potential and background of test mite populations.

The proposita, after normal growth and psychomotor development, at age of 30 months presented with a rapidly progressive gait disturbance with frequent falls and with loss of acquired language skills. Magnetic resonance imaging showed leukoencephalopathy. Biochemical blood essays showed a 91% reduction in the arylsulfatase A activity and genetic analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations of the Arylsulfatase A gene, enabling diagnosis of MLD. Subsequently, the patient had further rapid deterioration of motor and cognitive functions and developed drug-resistant epilepsy. At 4 years and 7 months of age bilateral thelarche occurred. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a small pituitary gland, extensive signal changes of the brain white matter, increased choline, decreased N-acetyl-aspartate and presence of lactate on 1HMR spectroscopy. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated a slightly augmented uterine longitudinal diameter (42 mm). The gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test revealed a pubertal LH peak of 12.9 UI/l.

We examined the developmental trajectories of HM in five cohorts of at-risk infants and one control cohort, followed from ages 2 to 10 months: 25 West syndrome (WS), 13 preterm birth (PB), 16 orality disorder (OD), 14 with visually impaired mothers (VIM), 7 early hospitalization (EH), and 19 typically developing infants (TD). Video-recorded data were collected in three different structured interactive contexts. Descriptors of the hand motion were used to examine the extent to which HM were associated with age and cohort. We obtained four principal results: (i) the kinematics of HM (spatial use, curvature, acceleration, and velocity) were significantly associated with age in all cohorts; (ii) HM significantly differed at 5–6 months of age in TD infants, depending on the context; (iii) environmental and developmental factors shaped the developmental trajectories of HM in different cohorts: environment for VIM, development for PB and WS, and both factors for OD and; (iv) the curvatures of HM showed atypical development in WS infants when developmental age was considered. These findings support the importance of using kinematics of HM to identify very early developmental disorders in an interactive context and would allow early prevention and intervention for at-risk infants.Keywords: infant at risk, hand movement, west syndrome, preterm, visually impaired mother, orality disorder, early hospitalization, developmental trajectories",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5826068/,abstract

Differences in LC-PUFAs between groups were compared using the Kruskal Wallis test and reference intervals determined using non-parametric statistical methods.ResultsLC-PUFAs levels were determined in 297 Zimbabwean children of whom 170 (57.2 %) were girls. The study determined that LC-PUFAs (wt/wt) ranges were EPA 0.06–0.55 %, DPA 0.38–1.98 %, DHA 1.13–3.52 %, ARA 5.58–14.64 % and ARA: EPA ratio 15.47–1633.33. Sixteen participants had omega-3 LC-PUFAs levels below the determined reference intervals, while 18 had higher omega-6 LC-PUFAs. The study did not show gender differences in omega-3 and omega-6 LC-PUFAs levels (all p > 0.05). EPA was significantly higher in the 8 year age group compared to those aged 7 and 9 years (median; 0.20 vs 0.17 vs 0.18, respectively, p = 0.049). ARA: EPA ratio was significantly higher in the 7 year age group compared to those aged 8 and 9 years (median; 64.38 vs 56.43 vs 55.87 respectively, p = 0.014).ConclusionsIn this cohort of children, lower EPA levels and higher ARA: EPA ratios were observed compared to those reported in apparently healthy children elsewhere. The high ARA: EPA ratios might increase the vulnerability of these children to inflammatory pathologies. Identification and incorporation into diet of locally produced foodstuffs rich in omega-3 LC-PUFAs is recommended as well as advocating for dietary supplementation with omega-3 fish oils and algae based oils.Keywords: Omega-3 long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids, Docosahexaenoic acid, Eicosapentaenoic acid, Docosapentaenoic acid, Arachidonic acid, Dried blood spot, Children, 7–9 year old",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4974798/,abstract

It is characterized by the deficiency of the phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, causing plasmatic hyperphenylalaninemia and variable neurological and cognitive impairments. Among the potential pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in autism spectrum disorders is the excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance which might result from alterations in excitatory/inhibitory synapse development, synaptic transmission and plasticity, downstream signalling pathways, and intrinsic neuronal excitability. Here, we investigated functional and molecular alterations in the prefrontal cortex (pFC) of BTBR-Pahenu2 (ENU2) mice, the animal model of PKU. Our data show higher frequency of inhibitory transmissions and significant reduced frequency of excitatory transmissions in the PKU-affected mice in comparison to wild type. Moreover, in the pFC of ENU2 mice, we reported higher levels of the post-synaptic cell-adhesion proteins neuroligin1 and 2. Altogether, our data point toward an imbalance in the E/I neurotransmission favouring inhibition in the pFC of ENU2 mice, along with alterations of the molecular components involved in the organization of cortical synapse. In addition to being the first evidence of E/I imbalance within cortical areas of a mouse model of PKU, our study provides further evidence of E/I imbalance in animal models of pathology associated with autism spectrum disorders.Keywords: neurotransmission, excitation and inhibition balance, cognitive delay, prefrontal cortex, neuroligins",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5454854/,abstract

In practice, quantifying the health and economic benefits of population-level screening programs such as newborn screening (NBS) is challenging. It requires that one specify the frequencies of health outcomes and events, such as hospitalizations, for a cohort of children with a given condition under two different scenarios—with or without NBS. Such analyses also assume that everything else, including treatments, is the same between groups. Lack of comparable data for representative screened and unscreened cohorts that are exposed to the same treatments following diagnosis can result in either under- or over-statement of differences. Accordingly, the benefits of early detection may be understated or overstated.

Introduction: Despite the large number of caregivers suffering from various psychiatric disorders, research on psychological symptoms among caregivers of hospitalized patients is lacking in Saudi populations. Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among caregivers of hospitalized Saudi patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study of depression, anxiety and stress among caregivers of hospitalized patients was conducted. Arabic speaking caregivers (n = 353) between the ages of 14 and 80 years were included in the study. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) test (Arabic version) was used to measure the three psychological symptoms. Results: The study has shown high rates of depression, anxiety and stress among caregivers (72.8%, 76.5%, and 61.5%, respectively). Depression was found to be associated with long-term hospital stay (81.4% vs. 69.3%; p-value = 0.021) and family caregivers (75.4% vs. 46.9%, p-value = 0.001). Anxiety was found to be associated with family caregivers (78.8% vs. 53.1%; p-value = 0.001). The three psychological symptoms were higher among those with an age above 20 years old (p-value < 0.05). Multivariate logistic models show the risk of the psychological symptoms increased with low-income, higher education, immediate relation to the patient, and older caregivers. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were very common among caregivers. The results showed that approximately 8 out of 10 caregivers suffer from at least one psychiatric disorder. Older, low socioeconomic status, and well-educated caregivers were identified as being at higher risk of developing psychiatric symptoms.Keywords: DASS, depression, anxiety, stress, caregivers, Saudi Arabia",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4614325/,abstract

Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) serves to illustrate the challenges, benefits and pitfalls associated with screening for ultra-rare inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs).A comprehensive, non-systematic review of published information from NP-C screening studies was conducted, focusing on diagnostic methods and study designs that have been employed to date. As a key part of this analysis, data from both successful studies (where cases were positively identified) and unsuccessful studies (where the chosen approach failed to identify any cases) were included alongside information from our own experiences gained from the planning and execution of screening for NP-C. On this basis, best-practice recommendations for ultra-rare IEM screening are provided. Twenty-six published screening studies were identified and categorised according to study design into four groups: 1) prospective patient cohort and family-based secondary screenings (18 studies); 2) analyses of archived ‘biobank’ materials (one study); 3) medical chart review and bioinformatics data mining (five studies); and 4) newborn screening (two studies). NPC1/NPC2 sequencing was the most common primary screening method (Sanger sequencing in eight studies and next-generation sequencing [gene panel or exome sequencing] in five studies), followed by biomarker analyses (usually oxysterols) and clinical surveillance.ConclusionsHistorically, screening for NP-C has been based on single-patient studies, small case series, and targeted cohorts, but the emergence of new diagnostic methods over the last 5–10 years has provided opportunities to screen for NP-C on a larger scale. Combining clinical, biomarker and genetic diagnostic methods represents the most effective way to identify NP-C cases, while reducing the likelihood of misdiagnosis.

The phenotypic heterogeneity of ASD has made it overwhelmingly difficult to determine the exact etiology and pathophysiology underlying the core symptoms, which are often accompanied by comorbidities such as hyperactivity, seizures, and sensorimotor abnormalities. To our benefit, the advent of animal models has allowed us to assess and test diverse risk factors of ASD, both genetic and environmental, and measure their contribution to the manifestation of autistic symptoms. At a broader scale, rodent models have helped consolidate molecular pathways and unify the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying each one of the various etiologies. This approach will potentially enable the stratification of ASD into clinical, molecular, and neurophenotypic subgroups, further proving their translational utility. It is henceforth paramount to establish a common ground of mechanistic theories from complementing results in preclinical research.

Background: Several studies have highlighted disturbance of redox homeostasis in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) which may be associated with neurological disorders observed in patients, especially during adulthood when phenylalanine restrictive diets are not maintained. The aim of this study was to assess the antioxidant profile in a cohort of PKU patients in comparison to the controls and to evaluate its relation to biochemical parameters especially phenylalaninemia.
Methods: We measured RNA expression of 22 antioxidant genes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in white blood cells of 10 PKU patients and 10 age- and gender-matched controls. We also assessed plasma amino acids, vitamins, oligo-elements, and urinary organic acids concentrations. Then we evaluated the relationship between redox status and biochemical parameters.
Results: In addition to expected biochemical disturbances, we highlighted a significant global decrease of antioxidant genes expression in PKU patients in comparison to the controls. This global decrease of antioxidant genes expression, including various isoforms of peroxiredoxins, glutaredoxins, glutathione peroxidases, and superoxide dismutases, was significantly correlated to hyperphenylalaninemia.
Conclusion: This study is the first to evaluate the expression of 22 antioxidant genes in white blood cells regarding biochemical parameters in PKU. These findings highlight the association of hyperphenylalaninemia with antioxidant genes expression. New experiments to specify the role of oxidative stress in PKU pathogenesis may be useful in suggesting new recommendations in PKU management and new therapeutic trials based on antioxidant defenses.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this chapter (doi:10.1007/8904_2017_16) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, PKU, Redox status, RNA antioxidant profile",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5740050/,abstract

To identify pleiotropy, an important focus in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is on finding genetic variants that are simultaneously associated with multiple traits. On the other hand, longitudinal designs are often employed in many complex disease studies, such that, traits are measured repeatedly over time within the same subject. Performing genetic association analysis simultaneously on multiple longitudinal traits for detecting pleiotropic effects is interesting but challenging. In this paper, we propose a 2-step method for simultaneously testing the genetic association with multiple longitudinal traits. In the first step, a mixed effects model is used to analyze each longitudinal trait. We focus on estimation of the random effect that accounts for the subject-specific genetic contribution to the trait; fixed effects of other confounding covariates are also estimated. This first step enables separation of the genetic effect from other confounding effects for each subject and for each longitudinal trait. Then in the second step, we perform a simultaneous association test on multiple estimated random effects arising from multiple longitudinal traits. The proposed method can efficiently detect pleiotropic effects on multiple longitudinal traits and can flexibly handle traits of different data types such as quantitative, binary, or count data. We apply this method to analyze the 16th Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW16) Framingham Heart Study (FHS) data.

In Wallonia and Brussels (Belgium), audiological intervention data are not collected in the screening program, and the ages at initiating audiological care have never been assessed. This study aimed to assess the evolution in the ages at initiating audiological intervention in the context of a newborn hearing screening program implementation.MethodsThis population-based descriptive study used data from the Belgian healthcare billing database. The main outcomes were the children’s ages at the initial audiological assessment, hearing-aid fitting, and cochlear implantation. Results were compared to the same outcomes from another Belgian regional program (Flanders) that was implemented one decade earlier. Annual birth cohorts from 2006 to 2011 were included in the study.ResultsIn Wallonia-Brussels, the median ages for all outcomes tended to decrease over time but remained higher than in Flanders for each birth cohort. For all outcomes except the hearing-aid fitting, differences in median ages between the two regions became less pronounced during the study period. In 2006, < 23% of the children from Wallonia-Brussels received any audiological care before the age of 12 months and these proportions were approximately 2-fold greater in the subsequent birth cohorts. For all outcomes, early care (< 12 months) was typically delivered less frequently in Wallonia-Brussels, compared to the delivery in Flanders. These region-specific differences exhibited a decreasing trend over time, and statistically significant differences were less common in the later birth cohorts.ConclusionsWe conclude that the hearing screening program in Wallonia and Brussels promoted earlier audiological intervention among hearing-impaired children.

Recent advancements in model organism biology allow us to test mutations across genetically diverse backgrounds and identify the genes that influence the expressivity of a mutation. In this study, we used the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, a collection of ∼200 wild-derived strains, to test the variability of the retinal phenotype of the Rh1G69D Drosophila model of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). We found that the Rh1G69D retinal phenotype is quite a variable quantitative phenotype. To identify the genes driving this extensive phenotypic variation, we performed a genome-wide association study. We identified 106 candidate genes, including 14 high-priority candidates. Functional testing by RNAi indicates that 10/13 top candidates tested influence the expressivity of Rh1G69D.

Here we present a mouse model in which UQ biosynthesis can be interrupted and partially restored at will. Global loss of UQ leads to gradual loss of mitochondrial function, gradual development of disease phenotypes, and shortened lifespan. However, we find that UQ does not act as antioxidant in vivo and that its requirement for electron transport is much lower than anticipated, even in vital mitochondria-rich organs. In fact, severely depressed mitochondrial function due to UQ depletion in the heart does not acutely impair organ function. In addition, we demonstrate that severe disease phenotypes and shortened lifespan are reversible upon partial restoration of UQ levels and mitochondrial function.

One hundred and ten cases were diagnosed based on clinical suspicion combined with laboratory confirmation by measuring their plasma phenylalanine levels using amino acid analyzer, while 3 cases were detected during neonatal screening. With the exception of the 3 cases detected during neonatal screening, all patients were clinically diagnosed and treated late. Psychometric evaluations of PKU patients were done using intelligence quotient (IQ, Stanford– Binet V), Childhood Autism Rating Scale, and Children’s Attention and Adjustment Survey. Dietetic management was applied. The results of neuroimaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain) and electroencephalography were included when available.ResultsThe overall results showed that 15.9% had hyperphenylalaninemia, 35.4% had mild to moderate PKU, and classic PKU was diagnosed in 48.7%. Global developmental delay (54.9%) and delayed language (29.2%) were the most frequent presentations. Moderately impaired or delayed overall IQ was present in 77%. While, 83.2% had moderately impaired or delayed verbal IQ, autism was diagnosed in 50.4%. Super average and average probability of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was diagnosed in 88.5%.

Herein, we investigated 115 missense SLC30A2/ZnT2 mutations from the ExAC database, equally distributed in the entire coding region, harboured in 668 alleles in 60 706 healthy individuals of diverse ethnicity. To estimate the frequency of LoF SLC30A2/ZnT2 mutations in the general population, we used bioinformatics tools to predict the potential impact of these mutations on ZnT2 functionality, and corroborated these predictions by a zinc transport assay in human MCF‐7 cells. We found 14 missense mutations that were markedly deleterious to zinc transport. Together with two conspicuous LoF mutations in the ExAC database, 26 SLC30A2/ZnT2 alleles harboured deleterious mutations, suggesting that at least 1 in 2334 newborn infants are at risk to develop TNZD.

In this study, we compare the efficacy and specificity of delivery of vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviral vectors to mouse liver by a number of injection schemes. Exploiting in vivo bioluminescence imaging as a readout after lentiviral gene transfer, we compare delivery by (1) “conventional” tail-vein injections, (2) “primed” injections, (3) “hydrodynamic” injections, or (4) direct “intrahepatic” injections into exposed livers. Reporter gene activity demonstrate potent and targeted delivery to liver by hydrodynamic injections. Enhanced efficacy is confirmed by analysis of liver sections from mice treated with GFP-encoding vectors, demonstrating 10-fold higher transduction rates and gene delivery to ∼80% of hepatocytes after hydrodynamic vector delivery. In summary, lentiviral vector transfer to mouse liver can be strongly augmented by hydrodynamic tail-vein injections, resulting in both reduced off-target delivery and transduction of the majority of hepatocytes.

Our objective was to utilize metabolomics analysis to assess monoamine metabolites in subjects with PKU consuming amino acid medical foods (AA-MF) and glycomacropeptide medical foods (GMP-MF).MethodsSubjects with PKU consumed a low-Phe diet combined with AA-MF and GMP-MF for 3 weeks each in a randomized, controlled, crossover study. Metabolomic analysis was conducted by Metabolon, Inc. on plasma (n=18) and urine (n=9) samples. Catecholamines and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were measured in 24-hr urine samples.ResultsIntake of Tyr and Trp was ~50% higher with AA-MF, and AA-MF were consumed in larger quantities, less frequently during the day compared with GMP-MF. Performance on neuropsychological tests and concentrations of neurotransmitters derived from Tyr and Trp were not significantly different with AA- MF or GMP-MF. Plasma serotonin levels of gut origin were higher in subjects with variant compared with classical PKU, and with GMP-MF compared with AA-MF in subjects with variant PKU. Metabolomics analysis identified higher levels of microbiome-derived compounds synthesized from Tyr, such as phenol sulfate, and higher levels of compounds synthesized from Trp in the kynurenine pathway, such as quinolinic acid, with ingestion of AA-MF compared with GMP-MF.ConclusionsThe Tyr from AA-MF is less bioavailable due, in part, to greater degradation by intestinal microbes compared with the Tyr from prebiotic GMP-MF.

Increasing the quality of the amplified DNA and the subsequent results of array genotyping is a secondary aim of this project.MethodsThis study is based on DNA extracted from dried blood spot samples. The extracted DNA was subsequently whole genome amplified using the REPLIg kit and genotyped on the PsychArray BeadChip (assessing > 570,000 SNPs genome wide). We used Genome Studio to evaluate the quality of the genotype data by call rates and log R ratios.ResultsThe whole genome amplification process is robust and does not vary between replicates. Altering amplification time, temperature or number of replicates did not affect our results. We found that spot size i.e. amount of input material could be reduced without compromising the quality of the array genotyping data. We also showed that whole genome amplification reaction volumes can be reduced by a factor of 4, without compromising the DNA quality.DiscussionWhole genome amplified DNA samples from dried blood spots is well suited for array genotyping and produces robust and reliable genotype data. However, the amplification process introduces additional noise to the data, making detection of structural variants such as copy number variants difficult. With this study, we explore ways of optimizing the amplification protocol in order to reduce noise and increase data quality. We found, that the amplification process was very robust, and that changes in amplification time or temperature did not alter the genotyping calls or quality of the array data. Adding additional replicates of each sample also lead to insignificant changes in the array data. Thus, the amount of noise introduced by the amplification process was consistent regardless of changes made to the amplification protocol.

The ability to do so depends on learning and remembering different locations, especially home-base. This capacity is encoded in the brain by two systems: one using cues outside the organism (distal cues), allocentric navigation, and one using self-movement, internal cues (proximal cues), for egocentric navigation. Whereas allocentric navigation involves the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and surrounding structures, egocentric navigation involves the dorsal striatum and connected structures; in humans this system encodes routes and integrated paths and when over-learned, becomes procedural memory. Allocentric assessment methods have been extensively reviewed elsewhere. The purpose of this paper is to review one specific method for assessing egocentric, route-based navigation in rats: the Cincinnati Water Maze (CWM). The test is an asymmetric multiple-T maze arranged in such a way that rats must learn to find path openings along walls rather at ends in order to reach the goal. Failing to do this leads to cul-de-sacs and repeated errors. The task may be learned in the light or dark, but in the dark, wherein distal cues are eliminated, provides the best assessment of egocentric navigation. When used in conjunction with tests of other types of learning, such as allocentric navigation, the CWM provides a balanced approach to assessing the two major forms of navigational learning and memory found in mammals.Keywords: learning and memory, egocentric learning, route-based navigation, mazes, Cincinnati water maze, swimming maze",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5056837/,abstract

Although preclinical research indicates that OT modulates the functional output of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system that processes rewards, no clinical brain imaging study to date has examined the effects of OT on this system using a reward processing paradigm. To address this, we used an incentive delay task to examine the effects of a single dose of intranasal OT, versus placebo (PLC), on neural responses to social and nonsocial rewards in children with ASD.MethodsIn this placebo-controlled double-blind study, 28 children and adolescents with ASD (age: M = 13.43 years, SD = 2.36) completed two fMRI scans, one after intranasal OT administration and one after PLC administration. During both scanning sessions, participants completed social and nonsocial incentive delay tasks. Task-based neural activation and connectivity were examined to assess the impact of OT relative to PLC on mesocorticolimbic brain responses to social and nonsocial reward anticipation and outcomes.ResultsCentral analyses compared the OT and PLC conditions. During nonsocial reward anticipation, there was greater activation in the right nucleus accumbens (NAcc), left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC), left superior frontal cortex, and right frontal pole (FP) during the OT condition relative to PLC. Alternatively, during social reward anticipation and outcomes, there were no significant increases in brain activation during the OT condition relative to PLC. A Treatment Group × Reward Condition interaction revealed relatively greater activation in the right NAcc, right caudate nucleus, left ACC, and right OFC during nonsocial relative to social reward anticipation during the OT condition relative to PLC. Additionally, these analyses revealed greater activation during nonsocial reward outcomes during the OT condition relative to PLC in the right OFC and left FP. Finally, functional connectivity analyses generally revealed changes in frontostriatal connections during the OT condition relative to PLC in response to nonsocial, but not social, rewards.ConclusionsThe effects of intranasal OT administration on mesocorticolimbic brain systems that process rewards in ASD were observable primarily during the processing of nonsocial incentive salience stimuli.

We aim to test correlation of T1D prevalence to the reduced natural selection measured by Biological State Index (Ibs).Research design and methodsCountry-speciﬁc estimates of T1D prevalence, life expectancy, obesity prevalence rate, urbanization rates, per capita sugars consumption and per capita gross domestic product (GDP) were obtained. Ibs and country-specific longevity (e50) increase for each country were self-calculated. These data were then matched to T1D prevalence by country for our ecological study among 118 countries. Countries were also grouped to study the associations in different regions. SPSS V.22 was used for correlation analysis.ResultsWorldwide, both Ibs and life expectancy at birth (Ibs proxy) were significantly correlated to T1D prevalence in Pearson r (r=0.713, p<0.001 and r=0.722, p<0.001, respectively) and Spearman's r (r=0.724, p<0.001 and r=0.689, p<0.001, respectively). T1D prevalence was not correlated to longevity increase measured as life expectancy at 50 years old. T1D prevalence was significantly associated with Ibs (r=0.307, p<0.001) and newborn life expectancy (r=0.349, p<0.001) independent of per capita total sugar consumption, per capita GDP, urbanization and obesity prevalence in partial correlation. Globally, both life expectancy at birth and Ibs exponentially correlated to T1D prevalence. Pearson correlations generally existed in different country categorizations by geographic region, culture background and economic status.ConclusionsReduced natural selection may have contributed to the increasing T1D prevalence worldwide. T1D epidemiology study in total population may be the practical solution to identify the causes of increasing T1D prevalence.Keywords: Type 1, Insulin, Epidemiology, Life and Health Expectancy",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4780042/,abstract

While the structures of these molecules, proteins and ligands, have been extensively studied, protein–ligand interactions, or binding modes, have not been comprehensively analyzed. Although methods for assessing similarities of binding site structures have been extensively developed, the methods for the computational treatment of binding modes have not been well established. Here, we developed a computational method for encoding the information about binding modes as graphs, and assessing their similarities. An all‐against‐all comparison of 20,040 protein–ligand complexes provided the landscape of the protein–ligand binding modes and its relationships with protein‐ and chemical spaces. While similar proteins in the same SCOP Family tend to bind relatively similar ligands with similar binding modes, the correlation between ligand and binding similarities was not very high (R
2 = 0.443). We found many pairs with novel relationships, in which two evolutionally distant proteins recognize dissimilar ligands by similar binding modes (757,474 pairs out of 200,790,780 pairs were categorized into this relationship, in our dataset). In addition, there were an abundance of pairs of homologous proteins binding to similar ligands with different binding modes (68,217 pairs). Our results showed that many interesting relationships between protein–ligand complexes are still hidden in the structure database, and our new method for assessing binding mode similarities is effective to find them.Keywords: protein–ligand complexes, binding modes, molecular recognition, bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, database",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5338237/,abstract

Onset may be at any age, from prenatal life to senescence. Many leukodystrophies are degenerative in nature, but some only impair white matter function. The clinical course is mostly progressive, but may also be static or even improving with time. Progressive leukodystrophies are often fatal, and no curative treatment is known. The last decade has witnessed a tremendous increase in the number of defined leukodystrophies also owing to a diagnostic approach combining magnetic resonance imaging pattern recognition and next generation sequencing. Knowledge on white matter physiology and pathology has also dramatically built up. This led to the recognition that only few leukodystrophies are due to mutations in myelin- or oligodendrocyte-specific genes, and many are rather caused by defects in other white matter structural components, including astrocytes, microglia, axons and blood vessels. We here propose a novel classification of leukodystrophies that takes into account the primary involvement of any white matter component. Categories in this classification are the myelin disorders due to a primary defect in oligodendrocytes or myelin (hypomyelinating and demyelinating leukodystrophies, leukodystrophies with myelin vacuolization); astrocytopathies; leuko-axonopathies; microgliopathies; and leuko-vasculopathies. Following this classification, we illustrate the neuropathology and disease mechanisms of some leukodystrophies taken as example for each category. Some leukodystrophies fall into more than one category. Given the complex molecular and cellular interplay underlying white matter pathology, recognition of the cellular pathology behind a disease becomes crucial in addressing possible treatment strategies.Keywords: Leukodystrophy, Myelin, Astrocytes, Oligodendrocytes, Microglia, Axons",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5563342/,abstract

However, it is unknown whether one or both HNF1 factors are obligatory for transactivating hepatic PCSK9 gene expression in vivo. We developed shRNA adenoviral constructs (Ad-shHNF1α and Ad-shHNF1β) to examine the effects of knockdown of HNF1α or HNF1β on PCSK9 expression and its consequent impact on LDL receptor (LDLR) protein levels in cultured hepatic cells and liver tissue. We demonstrated that infection with Ad-shHNF1α, but not Ad-shHNF1β, markedly reduced PCSK9 mRNA expression in HepG2 cells with a concomitant increase in LDLR protein abundance. Injecting Ad-shHNF1α in mice fed a normal diet significantly (∼50%) reduced liver mRNA expression and serum concentration of PCSK9 with a concomitant increase (∼1.9-fold) in hepatic LDLR protein abundance. Furthermore, we observed a modest but significant reduction in circulating LDL cholesterol after knockdown of HNF1α in these normolipidemic mice. Consistent with the observation that knockdown of HNF1β did not affect PCSK9 mRNA or protein expression in cultured hepatic cells, Ad-shHNF1β infection in mice resulted in no change in the hepatic mRNA expression or serum content of PCSK9. Altogether, our study demonstrates that HNF1α, but not HNF1β, is the primary positive regulator of PCSK9 transcription in mouse liver.Keywords: hepatic nuclear factor 1α, hepatic nuclear factor 1β, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, low density lipoprotein receptor, low density lipoprotein cholesterol",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373738/,abstract

Dysfunction in folding caused by genetic mutations in numerous genes causes protein conformational diseases. Membrane proteins are more prone to misfolding due to their more intricate folding than soluble proteins. Misfolded proteins are detected by the cellular quality control systems, especially in the endoplasmic reticulum, and proteins may be retained there for eventual degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or through autophagy. Some misfolded proteins aggregate, leading to pathologies in numerous neurological diseases. In vitro, modulating mutant protein folding by altering molecular chaperone expression can ameliorate some misfolding. Some small molecules known as chemical chaperones also correct mutant protein misfolding in vitro and in vivo. However, due to their lack of specificity, their potential as therapeutics is limited. Another class of compounds, known as pharmacological chaperones (pharmacoperones), binds with high specificity to misfolded proteins, either as enzyme substrates or receptor ligands, leading to decreased folding energy barriers and correction of the misfolding. Because many of the misfolded proteins are misrouted but do not have defects in function per se, pharmacoperones have promising potential in advancing to the clinic as therapeutics, since correcting routing may ameliorate the underlying mechanism of disease. This review will comprehensively summarize this exciting area of research, surveying the literature from in vitro studies in cell lines to transgenic animal models and clinical trials in several protein misfolding diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5966717/,abstract

Blood plasma was chosen as a biological fluid to preclude the influence of the hematocrit on the results of the analysis. A 30 μL sample of rat plasma was placed onto Whatman 903 Protein Saver Card and was allowed to dry. A single DPS is sufficient for preparing eight 3.2 mm discs, each containing approximately 1.5–1.6 μL of plasma. Warfarin extraction from one 3.2 mm disc was carried out by adding 200 μL of the acetonitrile : water mixture (1 : 1, v/v) containing 10 mM NH4COOH (pH 4.0), with incubation on a shaker at 1000 rpm for 1 h at 25°C. After chromatographic separation, warfarin and coumachlor (an internal standard) were measured using negative-ion multiple-reaction monitoring with ion transitions m/z 307 → 161 for warfarin and m/z 341 → 161 for the internal standard. The working range of this method is 10–10,000 ng/mL. Within this range, intra- and interday variability of precision and accuracy was <13% and recovery was 82–99%.

Selective screening is an important diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of IEM.MethodsIn Slovenia, symptomatic patients with suspected IEM are referred to the University Children’s Hospital Ljubljana. Techniques used for selective screening are gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, ion exchange chromatography-post-column derivatization, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and isoelectric focusing. Fluorimetric method is used for enzyme activity measurement.ResultsThere are 168 patients with amino and organic acidemias, 5 patients with disorders in fatty acids metabolism, 1 patient with a congenital disorder of glycosylation, 42 patients with Fabry disease (of which 37 are adult) and 20 patients with Gaucher disease (of which 18 are adult) in the Slovenian Register for Rare Diseases.ConclusionsIn Slovenia, management of patients with IEM is centralized at the University Children’s Hospital, with the exception of adult patients with Fabry and Gaucher disease.

This seminal work published in Nature in the early 70’s, in conjunction with many other studies, later served as the basis for the development of the narcotic antagonist (NTX) now used to treat both alcohol and opioid dependence. In 2006 an extended-release injectable of Naltrexone (XR-NTX) was approved by the FDA. Naltrexone is a relatively weak antagonist of κ- and δ-receptors and is also a potent μ-receptor antagonist. Dosages of naltrexone that effectively reduce opioid and alcohol consumption also actively block μ-receptors, but chronically down-regulate mesolimbic dopamine release. While studies show benefit especially in the short term, there is ongoing evidence that the retention and compliance with NTX are not sufficient to characterize adherence as high. However, extended-release NTX opioid treatment is associated with superior outcomes including less likely relapse (defined as daily use), and much longer time to relapse despite higher rates of concurrent non-opioid substance use like cocaine. Regarding long-term extended-release injectable (XR-NTX) for opioid dependence; there was higher compliance with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) than for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD.). Consideration of modalities in combination with XR-NTX is imperative.

We have recently identified a novel mechanism of eNOS uncoupling by which AAA develops, in Angiotensin II (Ang II) infused hyperphenylalaninemia 1 (hph-1) mice. Using this unique model we investigated effects on AAA formation of the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine, in view of the unclear relationship between hypertension and AAA, and unclear mechanisms of aneurysm protective effects of some blood pressure lowering drugs. Six-month old hph-1 mice were infused with Ang II (0.7 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks, and fed nifedipine chow at two different doses (5 and 20 mg/kg/day). While the high dose of nifedipine reduced blood pressure, the lower dose had no effect. Interestingly, the incidence rate of AAA dropped from 71% to 7 and 12.5% for low and high dose nifedipine, respectively. Expansion of abdominal aorta, determined by ultrasound imaging, was abolished by both doses of nifedipine, which recoupled eNOS completely to improve NO bioavailability. Both also abrogated aortic superoxide production. Of note, Ang II activation of NADPH oxidase in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, known to uncouple eNOS, was also attenuated by nifedipine. Although low dose was a sub-pressor while the high dose reduced blood pressure via inhibition of calcium channels, both doses were highly effective in preventing AAA by preserving eNOS coupling activity to eliminate sustained oxidative stress from uncoupled eNOS. These data demonstrate that oral treatment of nifedipine is highly effective in preserving eNOS function to attenuate AAA formation. Nifedipine may be used for AAA prevention either at low dose to AAA risk group, or at high dose to patients with co-existing hypertension.Keywords: abdominal aortic aneurysm, hph-1 mice, angiotensin II, nifedipine, blood pressure, eNOS recoupling, NADPH oxidase (NOX)",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4637219/,abstract

Most of the proteins involved in respiratory chain function are nuclear encoded, although 13 subunits of respiratory chain complexes (together with 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs necessary for their translation) encoded by mtDNA are essential for cell function. nDNA encodes not only respiratory chain subunits but also all the proteins responsible for mtDNA maintenance, especially those involved in replication, as well as other proteins necessary for the transcription and copy number control of this multicopy genome. Mutations in these genes can cause secondary instability of the mitochondrial genome in the form of depletion (decreased number of mtDNA molecules in the cell), vast multiple deletions or accumulation of point mutations which in turn leads to mitochondrial diseases inherited in a Mendelian fashion.

The major risk factors include lung inflammation and lung immaturity. In addition, genetic factors play an important role in susceptibility to moderate-to-severe BPD. In this study, the aim was to investigate whether common polymorphisms of specific genes that are involved in inflammation or differentiation of the lung have influence on BPD susceptibility.MethodsGenes encoding interleukin-6 (IL6) and its receptors (IL6R and IL6ST), IL-10 (IL10), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) were assessed for associations with moderate-to-severe BPD susceptibility. Five IL6, nine IL6R, four IL6ST, one IL10, two TNF, and 23 NR3C1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed in very preterm infants born in northern Finland (56 cases and 197 controls) and Canada (58 cases and 68 controls). IL-6, TNF and gp130 contents in umbilical cord blood, collected from very preterm infants, were studied for associations with the polymorphisms. Epistasis (i.e., interactions between SNPs in BPD susceptibility) was also examined. SNPs showing suggestive associations were analyzed in additional replication populations from Finland (39 cases and 188 controls) and Hungary (29 cases and 40 controls).ResultsNone of the studied SNPs were associated with BPD nor were the IL6, TNF or IL6ST SNPs associated with cord blood IL-6, TNF and gp130, respectively. However, epistasis analysis suggested that SNPs in IL6ST and IL10 were associated interactively with risk of BPD in the northern Finnish population; however, this finding did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing and the finding was not replicated in the other populations.ConclusionsWe conclude that the analyzed SNPs within IL6, IL6R, IL6ST, IL10, TNF, and NR3C1 were not associated with BPD.

It is a relatively less complicated surgical procedure, and has the advantage that it can be repeated several times if unsuccessful. Another advantage is that hepatocytes can be isolated from partly damaged livers which are not suitable for liver transplantation. Despite these advantages hepatocyte transplantation is less popular. Important issues are poor engraftment of the transplanted cells and the scarcity of donor hepatocytes. Generation of “hepatocyte like cells”/iHeps from embryonic stem cells (ES) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by directed differentiation is an emerging solution to the latter issue. Direct conversation or trans-differentiation of fibroblasts to “hepatocyte like cells” is another way which is, being explored. However this method has several inherent and technical disadvantages compared to the directed differentiation from ES or iPSC. There are several methods claiming to be “highly efficient” for generating “highly functional” “hepatocyte like cells”. Currently different groups are working independently and coming up with differentiation protocols and each group claiming an advantage for their protocol. Directed differentiation protocols need to be designed, compared, analyzed and tweaked systematically and logically than empirically.

Disturbed sleep may exacerbate the core symptoms of ASD. Behavioural interventions and supplemental melatonin medication are traditionally used to improve sleep quality, but poor sustainability of behavioural intervention effects and use of other medications that metabolise melatonin may degrade the effectiveness of these interventions. However, several studies have suggested that physical activity may provide an effective intervention for treating sleep disturbance in typically developing children. Thus, we designed a study to examine whether such an intervention is also effective in children with ASD. We present a protocol (4 December 2017) for a jogging intervention with a parallel and two-group randomised controlled trial design using objective actigraphic assessment and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin measurement to determine whether a 12-week physical activity intervention elicits changes in sleep quality or melatonin levels.Methods and analysisAll eligible participants will be randomly allocated to either a jogging intervention group or a control group receiving standard care. Changes in sleep quality will be monitored through actigraphic assessment and parental sleep logs. All participants will also be instructed to collect a 24-hour urine sample. 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, a creatinine-adjusted morning urinary melatonin representative of the participant’s melatonin levels, will be measured from the sample. All assessments will be carried out before the intervention (T1), immediately after the 12-week intervention or regular treatment (T2), 6 weeks after the intervention (T3) and 12 weeks after the intervention (T4) to examine the sustainability of the intervention effects.

Additionally, children with PKU exhibited food neophobia, with no preference for bitter tasting foods associated with the taste of phenylalanine (Phe)-free L-amino acid supplements.ObjectiveIn an observational extension study, we evaluated the influence of parental food choice and neophobia on their children's taste preferences and food neophobia.MethodsMale and female parents/caregivers of 35 children with PKU and 35 control parents, completed a neophobia and food frequency questionnaire for comparison using the same questionnaires that they completed for their children.ResultsBoth groups of children (PKU and non PKU control) were rated as more food neophobic and exhibited more neophobic behaviour than parents, although children with PKU more so than non-PKU controls (PKU food neophobia p < 0.0001vs control 0.001; PKU general neophobia p = 0.003 vs control p = 0.04). Both groups of children ate significantly more sweets, sweetened drinks and potato fries than their parents but differences were greater for children with PKU who also consumed more high carbohydrate (low protein) staple foods such as bread and pasta, and more sweet snacks such as biscuits than their parents. Non-PKU control children's food choices were closer to their parent's choices.ConclusionsIn PKU, parental food choices and their food neophobia have limited influence on their children's eating habits. Food neophobia in children with PKU may be associated with fear of eating unfamiliar foods potentially containing a source of protein or aspartame. Their preference for sweet foods may be influenced by limited food choices and habitual consumption of artificially sweetened L-amino acid supplements.Keywords: Metabolic disorders, Phenylketonuria (PKU), Neophobia, Taste preferences, Food frequency questionnaire, L-amino acid supplements",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5671408/,abstract

Integration of VAMS with mass spectrometry (MS)-based untargeted metabolomics is an attractive solution for both human and animal studies. However, to boost the use of VAMS in metabolomics, key pre-analytical questions need to be addressed. Therefore, in this work, we integrated VAMS in a MS-based untargeted metabolomics workflow and investigated pre-analytical strategies such as sample extraction procedures and metabolome stability at different storage conditions. We first evaluated the best extraction procedure for the polar metabolome and found that the highest number and amount of metabolites were recovered upon extraction with acetonitrile/water (70:30). In contrast, basic conditions (pH 9) resulted in divergent metabolite profiles mainly resulting from the extraction of intracellular metabolites originating from red blood cells. In addition, the prolonged storage of blood samples at room temperature caused significant changes in metabolome composition, but once the VAMS devices were stored at − 80 °C, the metabolome remained stable for up to 6 months. The time used for drying the sample did also affect the metabolome. In fact, some metabolites were rapidly degraded or accumulated in the sample during the first 48 h at room temperature, indicating that a longer drying step will significantly change the concentration in the sample.Keywords: Metabolomics, Volumetric absorptive microsampling, Mass spectrometry",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5694668/,abstract

The word thought is defined as the act of thinking about or considering something: an idea or opinion, or a set of ideas about a particular subject. It implicitly includes the processes of learning. Mental functions, including most if not all aspects of human behavior, such as those related to learning, arise from the activity of the brain. Neural connections that generate and support mental functions are formed throughout life, which enables lifelong learning of new concepts and skills. Both brain formation and function, as well as neural plasticity, are influenced by the activity of a variety of genes and also by epigenetic modifications, which contribute to the regulation of gene expression by adapting it to environmental conditions. In this review, aimed especially at education professionals, I discuss the genetic and epigenetic contributions to mental aspects related to learning processes in terms of heritability. I will argue that, despite most if not all aspects related to learning having a clear genetic background, innate abilities can be enhanced or diminished through educational processes. Thus, the importance of education, in the context of the inheritability of learning processes, will be discussed. The conclusion I draw is that, despite the relatively high genetic heritability shown in most brain processes associated with learning, educational practices are a key contributor to student development, allowing genetically based skills to be enhanced or alternatively diminished. Therefore one of the main goals of education in a changing an uncertain world should be to form adaptable and versatile people who can, and want to, make the most of their capabilities. Thus, knowledge derived from genetics and epigenetics, as well as from neuroscience, should be used to enhance education professionals’ understanding of the biological origins of differences in mental capabilities, thereby empowering them with the possibility to adopt more respectful and flexible educational practices to attain the goal mentioned above.Keywords: genetics, epigenetics, heritability, environment, learning, adaptation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6635910/,abstract

The WHO recommends home fortification using multiple micronutrient powders (MNPs) containing iron as a strategy to address anemia in children under two. We evaluated the effects of a program freely distributing MNP sachets to caregivers of infants in rural China.MethodsWe conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in Shaanxi province, enrolling all children aged 6–11 months in target villages. Following a baseline survey, investigators randomly assigned each village/cluster to a control or treatment group. In the treatment group, caregivers were instructed to give MNPs daily. Follow-up was after 6, 12, and 18 months of intervention. Primary outcomes were hemoglobin concentrations and scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.ResultsOne thousand, eight hundred and-two eligible children and their caregivers were enrolled. At baseline 48% (870) of children were anemic and 29% (529) were developmentally delayed. Six hundred and-ten children (117 villages) were assigned to the control group and 1192 children (234 villages) were assigned to the treatment group. Assignment to the treatment group was associated with an improvement in hemoglobin levels (marginal effect 1.77 g/L, 95% CI 0.017–3.520, p-value = 0.048) and cognitive development (marginal effect 2.23 points, 95% CI 0.061–4.399, p-value = 0.044) after 6 months but not thereafter. There were no significant effects on motor development. Zero effects after the first 6 months were not due to low compliance, low statistical power, or changes in feeding behavior.

An implementation plan focusing on the different levels on which NBS operates and the information needed on each level is essential for successful implementation. Continuously monitoring, and improving a program is vital, particularly following the implementation of screening for a new condition. An advisory committee could advise on implementation, development, review, modification, and cessation of (parts of) NBS.ConclusionThe results highlight that there are a wave of issues facing NBS programs that policy makers must take into account when developing policy processes. What conditions to screen, and the technologies used in NBS, are both up for debate.Keywords: decision making, newborn screening, public health policy, genomic screening, genetic testing",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5359248/,abstract

To understand this relationship, we developed the unfolding mutation screen (UMS) for in silico evaluation of the severity of genetic perturbations at the atomic level of protein structure. The program takes into account the protein-unfolding curve and generates propensities using calculated free energy changes for every possible missense mutation at once. These results are presented in a series of unfolding heat maps and a colored protein 3D structure to show the residues critical to the protein folding and are available for quick reference. UMS was tested with 16 crystal structures to evaluate the unfolding for 1391 mutations from the ProTherm database. Our results showed that the computational accuracy of the unfolding calculations was similar to the accuracy of previously published free energy changes but provided a better scale. Our residue identity control helps to improve protein homology models. The unfolding predictions for proteins involved in age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, and Leber’s congenital amaurosis matched well with data from previous studies. These results suggest that UMS could be a useful tool in the analysis of genotype-to-phenotype associations and next-generation sequencing data for inherited diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5131339/,abstract

A cesarean delivery rate of 53.8% (7/13) was noted among the cohort. Fetal distress or nonreassuring fetal status was the indication for 57% (4/7) cesarean deliveries. One patient was reported to have metabolic crisis as well as episodes of mild hyperammonemia.

The DLD gene consisting of 1413 bp encoding a protein of 470 amino acids was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and the recombinant enzyme was characterized. B. sphaericus DLD catalyzed the reduction of NAD+ by dihydrolipoamide and exhibited NADH-dependent diaphorase activity. The molecular weight of purified enzyme was about 50 kDa, and determined to be a monomeric protein. Diaphorase was active and stable from pH 7.0 to 9.0 with an optimal activity at pH 8.5. It showed its maximal activity at temperature of 30 °C and was almost stable at temperatures between 25 and 30 °C. Different metal ions and inhibitors showed no influence on the activity of target enzyme. The K

Participants reported lifelong compliance with AA-MF. In a crossover design, 8 participants (4 males, 4 females, aged 16–35 y) provided a 24-h urine collection after consuming AA-MF or GMP-MF for 1–3 weeks each.ResultsMale participants had significantly lower mean total body BMD Z-scores (means ± SE, males = − 0.9 ± 0.4; females, 0.2 ± 0.3; p = 0.01) and tended to have lower mean L1–4 spine and total femur BMD Z-scores compared to female participants. Only 50% percent of male participants had total body BMD Z-scores above − 1.0 compared to 100% of females (p = 0.06). Total femur Z-scores were negatively correlated with intake of AA-MF (r = − 0.58; p = 0.048). Males tended to consume more grams of protein equivalents per day from AA-MF (means ± SE, males: 67 ± 6 g, females: 52 ± 4 g; p = 0.057). Males and females demonstrated similar urinary excretion of renal net acid, magnesium and sulfate; males showed a trend for higher urinary calcium excretion compared to females (means ± SE, males: 339 ± 75 mg/d, females: 228 ± 69 mg/d; p = 0.13). Females had a greater percentage of total fat mass compared to males (means ± SE, males: 24.5 ± 4.8%, females: 36.5 ± 2.5%; p = 0.047).

With medication (nitisinone) and dietary restrictions outcomes are improved. We conducted a systematic review to investigate if treatment with nitisinone following screening provides better long-term outcomes than treatment with nitisinone following symptomatic detection.MethodsWe searched Web of Science, Medline, Pre-Medline, and Embase up to 23rd September 2016 for journal articles comparing clinical outcomes of TYR1 patients receiving earlier versus later nitisinone treatment. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed full texts, and appraised study quality. Data extraction was performed by a single reviewer and checked by a second.ResultsWe included seven articles out of 470 unique records identified by our search. The seven articles included four studies (three cohort studies and one cross-sectional study). Study sample sizes ranged from 17 to 148. There is consistent evidence that nitisinone is an effective treatment for TYR1, and some evidence that earlier treatment with nitisinone and dietary restrictions within the first one or 2 months of life is associated with reduced need for liver transplantation, lower rates of renal dysfunction, fewer neurological crises, and fewer, shorter hospital admissions compared to later treatment. However, study quality was moderate to weak, with high risk of confounding and applicability concerns to the screening context. We conducted post hoc analyses to address these issues. Results suggested an association between earlier treatment and fewer liver transplants (earlier treatment: 0% of 10–24 patients; later treatment: 25–60% of 4–15 patients), but no impact on neurological crises. We found no effect of treatment timing on mortality in either the primary or post hoc analyses. Post hoc analyses of other health-related outcomes were not possible because of sample size or reporting.ConclusionsThere is some evidence from observational studies that earlier treatment with nitisinone might be beneficial but this is subject to bias.

This represents a significant gap in the literature particularly for minority populations who are disproportionately affected by the consequences of SUD. Using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), we examined the coherence of neural activity, or functional connectivity, within the brain’s MCLS in 28 young adult Puerto Ricans (ages 25–27) who were part of a population-based cohort study. Half of the sample lived in San Juan, Puerto Rico; the other half lived in the South Bronx, New York. At each of the two sites, half of the sample had a history of a SUD. Relative to those without SUD, individuals with SUD had decreased connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and several regions within the MCLS. This finding was true irrespective of study site (i.e., San Juan or South Bronx). Reduced connectivity within the MCLS was also associated with higher self-reported levels of impulsivity. Path analysis suggested a potential mechanism linking impulsivity, the MCLS, and SUD: impulsivity, potentially by chronically promoting reward seeking behaviors, may contribute to decreased MCLS connectivity, which in turn, may confer vulnerability for SUD. Expanding upon prior studies suggesting that alterations within the MCLS underlie SUD, our findings suggest that such alterations are also related to impulsivity and are present in a high-risk young minority population.Keywords: functional MRI, mesocorticolimbic system, connectivity, substance use disorder, nucleus accumbens, impulsivity",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4879128/,abstract

Here, we would like to propose a simple HPLC/UV method based on a reversed-phase separation of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine (Tyr), phenylalanine (Phe), and optionally tryptophan (Trp) without any derivatization. The hydrolysis of the proteins and peptides was performed by an accelerated microwave technique, which needs only 30 minutes. Two internal standard compounds, homotyrosine (HTyr) and 4-fluorophenylalanine (FPhe) were used for calibration. The limit of detection (LOD) was estimated to be 0.05 µM (~10 µg/L) for tyrosine and phenylalanine at 215 nm. The LOD for a protein determination was calculated to be below 16 mg/L (~300 ng BSA absolute). Aromatic amino acid analysis (AAAA) offers excellent accuracy and a precision of about 5% relative standard deviation, including the hydrolysis step. The method was validated with certified reference materials (CRM) of amino acids and of a pure protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA).

Pleiotropy has major implications for evolution, development, ageing, and disease. Except for disease data, pleiotropy is almost exclusively estimated from full gene knockouts. However, most deleterious alleles segregating in natural populations do not fully abolish gene function, and the degree to which a polymorphism reduces protein function may influence the number of traits it affects. Utilizing genome-scale metabolic models for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that most fitness-reducing full gene knockouts of metabolic genes in these fast-growing microbes have pleiotropic effects, i.e., they compromise the production of multiple biomass components. Alleles of the same metabolic enzyme-encoding gene with increasingly reduced enzymatic function typically affect an increasing number of biomass components. This increasing pleiotropy is often mediated through effects on the generation of currency metabolites such as ATP or NADPH. We conclude that the physiological effects observed in full gene knockouts of metabolic genes will in most cases not be representative for alleles with only partially reduced enzyme capacity or expression level.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6250661/,abstract

638,10.1093/ilar/ilu047,25541546,"Go to:AbstractThe vast majority of drugs entering human trials fail. This problem (called
“attrition”) is widely recognized as a public health crisis, and has
been discussed openly for the last two decades. Multiple recent reviews argue that
animals may be just too different physiologically, anatomically, and psychologically
from humans to be able to predict human outcomes, essentially questioning the
justification of basic biomedical research in animals.This review argues instead that the philosophy and practice of experimental design
and analysis is so different in basic animal work and human clinical trials that an
animal experiment (as currently conducted) cannot reasonably predict the outcome of a
human trial. Thus, attrition does reflect a lack of predictive validity of animal
experiments, but it would be a tragic mistake to conclude that animal models cannot
show predictive validity.A variety of contributing factors to poor validity are reviewed. The need to adopt
methods and models that are highly specific (i.e., which can identify true negative
results) in order to complement the current preponderance of highly sensitive methods
(which are prone to false positive results) is emphasized. Concepts in
biomarker-based medicine are offered as a potential solution, and changes in the use
of animal models required to embrace a translational biomarker-based approach are
outlined. In essence, this review advocates a fundamental shift, where we treat every
aspect of an animal experiment that we can as if it was a clinical trial in a human
population.However, it is unrealistic to expect researchers to adopt a new methodology that
cannot be empirically justified until a successful human trial. “Validation
with known failures” is proposed as a solution. Thus new methods or models can
be compared against existing ones using a drug that has translated (a known positive)
and one that has failed (a known negative). Current methods should incorrectly
identify both as effective, but a more specific method should identify the negative
compound correctly. By using a library of known failures we can thereby empirically
test the impact of suggested solutions such as enrichment, controlled
heterogenization, biomarker-based models, or reverse-translated measures.Keywords: animal biology, biomarker based, heterogenization, reverse-translated",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342719/,abstract

Objective: To explore the level of coping and management of parents of children with inherited metabolic disorders (IMD) and the relationship with children’s cognitive, behavioural and social functioning.
Methods: Parents of children (n = 22) with confirmed IMD (glutaric aciduria type I, methylmalonic aciduria, propionic aciduria, isovaleric aciduria, glycogen storage disease, maple syrup urine disease, ornithine transcarbamylase or very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) completed standardised questionnaires regarding psychological distress, coping and family management. Children completed cognitive assessments and parents rated their behavioural and social functioning on standardised questionnaires. Scores were compared with normative data.
Results: Most parents were coping well; 4/22 reported high levels of psychological distress. Exploratory analysis found that parent coping variables were correlated to the child’s internalising symptoms, whereas family management was related to children’s externalising behaviours and social skills. No relationship was found between parent variables and cognitive functioning.
Conclusions: Parental coping and family management impact on the child’s internalising symptoms and externalising behaviours, respectively.

Patients with severe malaria have low urinary BH4, elevated plasma phenylalanine, and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, suggesting that BH4 depletion may limit phenylalanine metabolism and nitric oxide synthesis. We infected C57BL/6 mice with Plasmodium berghei ANKA to characterize BH4 availability and to investigate the effects of BH4 supplementation. P. berghei ANKA infection lowered BH4 in plasma, erythrocytes, and brain tissue but raised it in aorta and liver tissue. The ratio of BH4 to 7,8-BH2 (the major product of BH4 oxidation) was decreased in plasma, erythrocytes, and brain tissue, suggesting that oxidation contributes to BH4 depletion. The continuous infusion of sepiapterin (a BH4 precursor) and citrulline (an arginine precursor) raised the concentrations of BH4 and arginine in both blood and tissue compartments. The restoration of systemic BH4 and arginine availability in infected mice produced only a minor improvement in whole blood nitrite concentrations, a biomarker of NO synthesis, and failed to prevent the onset of severe disease symptoms. However, sepiapterin and citrulline infusion reduced the ratio of phenylalanine to tyrosine in plasma, aortic tissue, and brain tissue. In summary, BH4 depletion in P. berghei infection may compromise both nitric oxide synthesis and phenylalanine metabolism; however, these findings require further investigation in human patients with severe malaria.Keywords: metabolism, host response, plasmodium, nitric oxide, endothelium",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6289270/,abstract

Surprisingly, hypoglycemia may occur in this disorder despite appropriately suppressed insulin. To better understand the islet-specific contribution, transgenic mice expressing the human activating mutation in β-cells (H454Y mice) were characterized in vivo. As in the humans with HI/HA, H454Y mice had fasting hypoglycemia, but plasma insulin concentrations were similar to the controls. Paradoxically, both glucose- and glutamine-stimulated insulin secretion were severely impaired in H454Y mice. Instead, lack of a glucagon response during hypoglycemic clamps identified impaired counterregulation. Moreover, both insulin and glucagon secretion were impaired in perifused islets. Acute pharmacologic inhibition of GDH restored both insulin and glucagon secretion and normalized glucose tolerance in vivo. These studies support the presence of an mtGTP-dependent signal generated via β-cell GDH that inhibits α-cells. As such, in children with activating GDH mutations of HI/HA, this insulin-independent glucagon suppression may contribute importantly to symptomatic hypoglycemia.

Oxidative stress occurs once the antioxidant defenses of the body become overwhelmed and are no longer able to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Although not always the primary cause of disease, mitochondrial dysfunction as a secondary consequence disease of pathophysiology can result in increased ROS generation together with an impairment in cellular energy status. Mitochondrial dysfunction may result from either free radical-induced oxidative damage or direct impairment by the toxic metabolites which accumulate in certain metabolic diseases.

Nitric oxide synthase uncoupling occurs with chronic pressure overload, and both are ameliorated by exogenous tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)—a cofactor required for normal nitric oxide synthase function—supporting a pathophysiological link. Genetically augmenting BH4 synthesis in endothelial cells fails to replicate this benefit, indicating that other cell types dominate the effects of exogenous BH4 administration. We tested whether the primary cellular target of BH4 is the cardiomyocyte or whether other novel mechanisms are invoked.Methods and ResultsMice with cardiomyocyte‐specific overexpression of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (mGCH1) and wild‐type littermates underwent transverse aortic constriction. The mGCH1 mice had markedly increased myocardial BH4 and, unlike wild type, maintained nitric oxide synthase coupling after transverse aortic constriction; however, the transverse aortic constriction–induced abnormalities in cardiac morphology and function were similar in both groups. In contrast, exogenous BH4 supplementation improved transverse aortic constricted hearts in both groups, suppressed multiple inflammatory cytokines, and attenuated infiltration of inflammatory macrophages into the heart early after transverse aortic constriction.Conclusions
BH4 protection against adverse remodeling in hypertrophic cardiac disease is not driven by its prevention of myocardial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling, as presumed previously.

Targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the major strategies for AD therapeutics, as cholinergic pathways in the cerebral cortex and basal forebrain are compromised. Herein, we report the design of some copper and other metal based donepezil derivatives, employing density functional theory (DFT). All designed compounds are optimized at the B3LYP/SDD level of theory. Dipole moments, electronic energie, enthalpies, Gibbs free energies, and HOMO-LUMO gaps of these modified compounds are also investigated in the subsequent analysis. The molecules were then subjected to molecular docking analysis with AChE to study the molecular interactions broadly. Ensemble based docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the best candidates were also performed. Docking and MD simulation reveal that modified drugs are more potent than unmodified donepezil, where Trp86, Tyr337, Phe330 residues play some important roles in drug-receptor interactions. According to ensemble based docking, D9 shows greater binding affinity compared to the parent in most conformations obtained from protein data bank and MD simulation. In addition, it is observed that the π- π stacking with the residues of Trp86, Tyr337, Tyr341, Tyr124 and Trp286 may be required for strong ligand binding. Moreover, ADME/T analysis suggests that modified derivatives are less toxic and have improved pharmacokinetic properties than those of the parent drug.

The diet restricts intake of Phe from natural proteins in combination with traditional amino acid medical foods (AA-MFs) or glycomacropeptide medical foods (GMP-MFs) that contain primarily intact protein and a small amount of Phe.Objective: We investigated the efficacy and safety of a low-Phe diet combined with GMP-MFs or AA-MFs providing the same quantity of protein equivalents in free-living subjects with phenylketonuria.Design: This 2-stage, randomized crossover trial included 30 early-treated phenylketonuria subjects (aged 15–49 y), 20 with classical and 10 with variant phenylketonuria. Subjects consumed, in random order for 3 wk each, their usual low-Phe diet combined with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs. The treatments were separated by a 3-wk washout with AA-MFs. Fasting plasma amino acid profiles, blood Phe concentrations, food records, and neuropsychological tests were obtained.Results: The frequency of medical food intake was higher with GMP-MFs than with AA-MFs. Subjects rated GMP-MFs as more acceptable than AA-MFs and noted improved gastrointestinal symptoms and less hunger with GMP-MFs. ANCOVA indicated no significant mean ± SE increase in plasma Phe (62 ± 40 μmol/L, P = 0.136), despite a significant increase in Phe intake from GMP-MFs (88 ± 6 mg Phe/d, P = 0.026). AA-MFs decreased plasma Phe (−85 ± 40 μmol/L, P = 0.044) with stable Phe intake. Blood concentrations of Phe across time were not significantly different (AA-MFs = 444 ± 34 μmol/L, GMP-MFs = 497 ± 34 μmol/L), suggesting similar Phe control. Results of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function were not significantly different.Conclusions: GMP-MFs provide a safe and acceptable option for the nutritional management of phenylketonuria. The greater acceptability and fewer side effects noted with GMP-MFs than with AA-MFs may enhance dietary adherence for individuals with phenylketonuria.

We used genomic profiles based on 698 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from nine breeds of domestic cattle (Bos taurus) and the European bison (Bison bonasus) to investigate how ROH distributions can be compared within and among species. We focused on two length classes: 0.5–15 Mb to investigate ancient events and >15 Mb to address recent events (approximately three generations). For each length class, we chose a few chromosomes with a high number of ROH, calculated the percentage of times a SNP appeared in a ROH, and plotted the results.

As an outbreak begins, epidemiological investigations and traditional public health responses are generally mounted very quickly. However, patient-centred research is usually not prioritised when planning and enacting the response. Instead, the clinical research response occurs subsequent to and separate from the public health response, and is inadequate for evidence-based decision-making at the bedside or in the offices of public health policymakers.DiscussionThe deficiencies of the clinical research response to severe acute respiratory syndrome, pandemic influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus demonstrate that current research models do not adequately inform and improve the quality of clinical care or public health response. Three suggestions for improvements are made. First, integrate the data and sample collection needs for clinical and public health decision-making within a unified framework, combined with a risk-based, rather than a discipline-based, approach to ethical review and consent. Second, develop clinical study methods and tools that are specifically designed to meet the epidemiological and contextual challenges of emerging and epidemic infectious diseases. Third, invest in investigator-led clinical research networks that are primed and incentivised to respond to outbreak infections, and which can call on the support and resources of a central centre of excellence.ConclusionsIt is crucial that the field of epidemic science matures to place patients at the heart of the response. This can only be achieved when patient-centred research is integrated in the outbreak response from day one and practical steps are taken to reduce the barriers to the generation of reliable and useful evidence.Keywords: Epidemic, Pandemic, Outbreak, Clinical research, Clinical trial, Ebola, Zika",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5165716/,abstract

To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the impact of fatty fish on cognition in preschool children. The purpose of the trial was to investigate whether an increased intake of fatty fish compared to meat improves cognitive function in children 4–6 years old.MethodsThe children (n = 232) in this two-armed RCT, Fish Intervention Studies-KIDS (FINS-KIDS) were recruited from 13 kindergartens in Bergen, Norway. They were randomly assigned to lunch meals with fatty fish (herring/mackerel) or meat (chicken/lamb/beef) three times a week for 16 weeks. The fish and meat were weighed before and after the meals to record the exact consumption (dietary compliance). The primary outcome was cognitive function measured by the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 3rd edition (WPPSI-III) and fine-motor coordination measured by the 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) at pre- and post-intervention.

The first is that intelligence is influenced by many variants and those that are tagged by common single nucleotide polymorphisms account for around 30% of the phenotypic variation. The second, in line with other polygenic traits such as height and schizophrenia, is that these variants are not randomly distributed across the genome but cluster in genes that work together. Less clear is whether the very low range of cognitive ability (intellectual disability) is simply one end of the normal distribution describing individual differences in cognitive ability across a population. Here, we examined 40 genes with a known association with non-syndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability (NS-ARID) to determine if they are enriched for common variants associated with the normal range of intelligence differences. The current study used the 3511 individuals of the Cognitive Ageing Genetics in England and Scotland (CAGES) consortium. In addition, a text mining analysis was used to identify gene sets biologically related to the NS-ARID set. Gene-based tests indicated that genes implicated in NS-ARID were not significantly enriched for quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with intelligence. These findings suggest that genes in which mutations can have a large and deleterious effect on intelligence are not associated with variation across the range of intelligence differences.Keywords: Genetics, Intellectual disabilities, Gene set analysis, GWAS",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4725222/,abstract

A total of 94 BMI-associated SNPs, selected from a previous GWAS on BMI, were used to construct weighted genetic scores for BMI (GSBMI). Linear regression modeling was used to estimate the effect of gene-environment interactions on BMI for 131 lifestyle factors related to: dietary habits, smoking and alcohol consumption, physical activity, socioeconomic status, mental health, sleeping patterns, as well as female-specific factors such as menopause and childbirth. In total, 15 lifestyle factors were observed to interact with GSBMI, of which alcohol intake frequency, usual walking pace, and Townsend deprivation index, a measure of socioeconomic status, were all highly significant (p = 1.45*10−29, p = 3.83*10−26, p = 4.66*10−11, respectively). Interestingly, the frequency of alcohol consumption, rather than the total weekly amount resulted in a significant interaction. The FTO locus was the strongest single locus interacting with any of the lifestyle factors. However, 13 significant interactions were also observed after omitting the FTO locus from the genetic score.

681,10.3389/fnins.2017.00248,28579939,"Go to:AbstractSynapses must be preserved throughout an organism's lifespan to allow for normal brain function and behavior. Synapse maintenance is challenging given the long distances between the termini and the cell body, reliance on axonal transport for delivery of newly synthesized presynaptic proteins, and high rates of synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis. Hence, synapses rely on efficient proteostasis mechanisms to preserve their structure and function. To this end, the synaptic compartment has specific chaperones to support its functions. Without proper synaptic chaperone activity, local proteostasis imbalances lead to neurotransmission deficits, dismantling of synapses, and neurodegeneration. In this review, we address the roles of four synaptic chaperones in the maintenance of the nerve terminal, as well as their genetic links to neurodegenerative disease. Three of these are Hsp40 co-chaperones (DNAJs): Cysteine String Protein alpha (CSPα; DNAJC5), auxilin (DNAJC6), and Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis 8 (RME-8; DNAJC13). These co-chaperones contain a conserved J domain through which they form a complex with heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70), enhancing the chaperone's ATPase activity. CSPα is a synaptic vesicle protein known to chaperone the t-SNARE SNAP-25 and the endocytic GTPase dynamin-1, thereby regulating synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis. Auxilin binds assembled clathrin cages, and through its interactions with Hsc70 leads to the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles, a process necessary for the regeneration of synaptic vesicles. RME-8 is a co-chaperone on endosomes and may have a role in clathrin-coated vesicle endocytosis on this organelle. These three co-chaperones maintain client function by preserving folding and assembly to prevent client aggregation, but they do not break down aggregates that have already formed. The fourth synaptic chaperone we will discuss is Heat shock protein 110 (Hsp110), which interacts with Hsc70, DNAJAs, and DNAJBs to constitute a disaggregase. Hsp110-related disaggregase activity is present at the synapse and is known to protect against aggregation of proteins such as α-synuclein. Congruent with their importance in the nervous system, mutations of these co-chaperones lead to familial neurodegenerative disease. CSPα mutations cause adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, while auxilin mutations result in early-onset Parkinson's disease, demonstrating their significance in preservation of the nervous system.Keywords: Hsp110, HSP70, neurodegeneration, proteostasis, synapse maintenance, endocytosis, exocytosis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5437171/,abstract

Prevention would be ideal, but formidable biological and technical hurdles face any intervention that seeks to target the main causes, genetic mutations in the embryo. Other factors, however, significantly modify the total risk in individuals who carry mutations. Investigation of these factors could lead to an alternative approach to prevention. To define the risk modifiers, our group has taken an “experimental epidemiologic” approach via inbred mouse strain crosses. The original intent was to map genes that modify an individual’s risk of heart defects caused by an Nkx2-5 mutation. During the analysis of >2000 Nkx2-5+/− offspring from one cross we serendipitously discovered a maternal-age associated risk, which also exists in humans. Reciprocal ovarian transplants between young and old mothers indicate that the incidence of heart defects correlates with the age of the mother and not the oocyte, which implicates a maternal pathway as the basis of the risk. The quantitative risk varies between strain backgrounds, so maternal genetic polymorphisms determine the activity of a factor or factors in the pathway. Most strikingly, voluntary exercise by the mother mitigates the risk. Therefore, congenital heart disease can in principle be prevented by targeting a maternal pathway even if the embryo carries a causative mutation. Further mechanistic insight is necessary to develop an intervention that could be implemented on a broad scale, but the physiology of maternal-fetal interactions, aging, and exercise are notoriously complex and undefined. This suggests that an unbiased genetic approach would most efficiently lead to the relevant pathway. A genetic foundation would lay the groundwork for human studies and clinical trials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5014674/,abstract

Study objectives were to demonstrate cytoprotective and regenerative effects of EPO in burned patients in terms of improved wound healing, reduced morbidity and mortality. This was a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial. The trial was conducted in 13 specialized burn care centers in Germany. Adult Patients with 2b° or 3° burn injuries were included. Patients received state of the art burn care including obligatory split skin graft transplantation.

Primary endpoint analysis revealed inconclusive results, as only a minority of patients reached the primary endpoint [100% re-epithelialization: EPO: 23% (9/40); Placebo 30% (11/37)]. Several secondary endpoints such as SOFA score (morbidity), EPO level in blood and wound healing onset revealed clinical, and statistically significant results in favor of the EPO group. Adverse Events (AEs) and Severe Adverse Events (SAEs) were in expected ranges; AEs EPO: 80%, (36/45), Placebo: 77%, (30/39); SAEs EPO: 24%, (11/45), Placebo: 24%, (8/39).

Using SAXS, we further describe the domain movements involved in allosteric activation of PheH in solution and present the first demonstration of chromatography-coupled SAXS with Evolving Factor Analysis (EFA), a powerful method for separating scattering components in a model-independent way. Together, these results support a model for allostery in PheH in which phenylalanine stabilizes the dimerization of the regulatory domains and exposes the active site for substrate binding and other structural changes needed for activity.Keywords: allostery, phenylalanine hydroxylase, PAH, phenylketonuria, ACT domain, SAXS",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4896396/,abstract

The diversity of metabolic pathways involved explains the difficulties in establishing their diagnosis. However, early diagnosis is usually mandatory for successful treatment. Given the considerable clinical overlap between some inborn errors, biochemical and molecular tests are crucial in making a diagnosis. Conventional biological diagnosis procedures are based on a time-consuming series of sequential and segmented biochemical tests. The rise of “omic” technologies offers holistic views of the basic molecules that build a biological system at different levels. Metabolomics is the most recent “omic” technology based on biochemical characterization of metabolites and their changes related to genetic and environmental factors. This review addresses the principles underlying metabolomics technologies that allow them to comprehensively assess an individual biochemical profile and their reported applications for IEM investigations in the precision medicine era.Keywords: metabolomics, inborn errors of metabolism, screening, diagnosis, systems medicine, precision medicine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4964538/,abstract

Rooted in both medical genetics and clinical psychiatry, the paper is designed as an integrated source of information of the current and potential future application of emerging genomic technologies as diagnostic tools in psychiatry, moving beyond the classical concept of patient approach. Selected approaches are presented, starting from currently used technologies (next-generation sequencing (NGS) and microarrays), followed by newer options (reverse phenotyping). Next, we describe an old concept in a new light (endophenotypes), subsequently coming up with a sophisticated and complex approach (gene networks) ending by a nascent field (computational psychiatry). The challenges and barriers that exist to translate genomic research to real-world patient assessment are further discussed. We emphasize the view that only a paradigm shift can bring a fundamental change in psychiatric practice, allowing to disentangle the intricacies of mental diseases. All the diagnostic methods, as described, are directed at uncovering the integrity of the system including many types of relations within a complex structure. The integrative system approach offers new opportunity to connect genetic background with specific diseases entities, or concurrently, with symptoms regardless of a diagnosis. To advance the field, we propose concerted cross-disciplinary effort to provide a diagnostic platform operating at the general level of genetic pathogenesis of complex-trait psychiatric disorders rather than at the individual level of a specific disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537634/,abstract

The heterogeneity of liver cancer represents a clinical challenge. In liver, the transcription factor PPARγ promotes metabolic adaptations of lipogenesis and aerobic glycolysis under the control of Akt2 activity, but the role of PPARγ in liver tumorigenesis is unknown. Here we have combined preclinical mouse models of liver cancer and genetic studies of a human liver biopsy atlas with the aim of identifying putative therapeutic targets in the context of liver steatosis and cancer. We have revealed a protumoral interaction of Akt2 signaling with hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) and PPARγ, transcription factors that are master regulators of hepatocyte and adipocyte differentiation, respectively. Akt2 phosphorylates and inhibits HNF1α, thus relieving the suppression of hepatic PPARγ expression and promoting tumorigenesis. Finally, we observed that pharmacological inhibition of PPARγ is therapeutically effective in a preclinical murine model of steatosis-associated liver cancer. Taken together, our studies in humans and mice reveal that Akt2 controls hepatic tumorigenesis through crosstalk between HNF1α and PPARγ.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5409083/,abstract

Although many studies show that stressful conditions reduce the number of newborn neurons in the adult dentate gyrus (DG), little is known about whether and how stress impacts on dendritic development and structural maturation of these newborn neurons. We, herein, demonstrate that chronic stress impacts differentially on doublecortin (DCX)-positive immature neurons in distinct phases of maturation. Specifically, the density of the DCX-positive immature neurons whose dendritic tree reaches the inner molecular layer (IML) of DG is reduced in stressed animals, whereas their dendritic complexity is increased. On the contrary, no change on the density of DCX-positive neurons whose dendritic tree extends to the medial/outer molecular layer (M/OML) of the DG is found under stress conditions, whereas the dendritic complexity of these cells is diminished. In addition, DCX+ cells displayed a more complex and longer arbor in the dendritic compartments located in the granular cell layer of the DG under stress conditions; on the contrary, their dendritic segments localized into the M/OML were shorter and less complex. These findings suggest that the neuroplastic effects of chronic stress on dendritic maturation and complexity of DCX+ immature neurons vary based on the different maturation stage of DCX-positive cells and the different DG sublayer, highlighting the complex and dynamic stress-driven neuroplasticity of immature neurons in the adult hippocampus.Subject terms: Neuroscience, Physiology, Psychiatric disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6486609/,abstract

While limiting protein intake, dietary therapy should provide adequate daily intake of energy, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, and microelements. We evaluated nutrient balance in 14 patients with classical PKU aged 4–38 years. Approximately 80–85% of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of protein in Japanese was supplied through phenylalanine-free (Phe-free) milk and Phe-free amino acid substitutes. Nutritional evaluation showed that the calorie and protein intakes were equivalent to the RDA. Phenylalanine intake was 9.8 ± 2.2 mg/kg of body weight/day, which maintained normal blood phenylalanine concentration by the 80% Phe-free protein rule. The protein, fat, and carbohydrate ratio was 9.5:23.9:66.6% with relative carbohydrate excess. Phe-free milk and amino acid substitutes provided 33.7% of carbohydrate, 82.1% of protein, and 66.7% of fat intake in all. Selenium and biotin intakes were 25.0% and 18.1% of the RDA and adequate intake (AI) for Japanese, respectively; both were not included in Phe-free milk. PKU patients showed low serum selenium, low urinary biotin, and high urinary 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid in this study. The intakes of magnesium, zinc, and iodine were low (71.5%, 79.5%, and 71.0% of the RDA, respectively) and that of phosphorus was 79.7% of the AI, although they were supplemented in Phe-free milk. PKU patients depend on Phe-free milk and substitutes for daily requirement of microelements and vitamins as well as protein and fat. Development of low-protein food makes it possible to achieve the aimed phenylalanine blood level, but this lowers the intake of microelements and vitamins from natural foods. The dietary habits vary continuously with age and environment in PKU patients. We recommend the addition of selenium and biotin to Phe-free milk in Japan and the need to review the composition of microelements and vitamins in A-1 and MP-11 preparations.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, Phenylalanine hydroxylase, Nutrition, Microelement, Vitamin, Selenium, Biotin, Magnesium, Zinc, Iodine, Phosphorus",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4995528/,abstract

Pegvaliase (PEGylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase) is an investigational agent to lower plasma Phe in adults with PKU. This study aimed to characterize the long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of pegvaliase in adults with PKU.MethodsPAL-003 is an ongoing, open-label, long-term extension study of the pegvaliase dose-finding parent phase 2 studies. Participants continued the dose of pegvaliase from one of three parent studies, with dose adjustments to achieve a plasma Phe concentration between 60 and 600 μmol/L.ResultsMean (standard deviation [SD]) plasma Phe at treatment-naïve baseline for 80 participants in the parent studies was 1302.4 (351.5) μmol/L. In the 68 participants who entered the extension study, plasma Phe decreased 58.9 (39)% from baseline, to 541.6 (515.5) μmol/L at Week 48 of treatment. Plasma Phe concentrations ≤120 μmol/L, ≤360 μmol/L, and ≤ 600 μmol/L were achieved by 78.7, 80.0, and 82.5% of participants, respectively. Mean (SD) protein intake at baseline was 69.4 (40.4) g/day (similar to the recommended intake for the unaffected population) and remained stable throughout the study. All participants experienced adverse events (AEs), which were limited to mild or moderate severity in most (88.8%); the most common AEs were injection-site reaction (72.5%), injection-site erythema (67.5%), headache (67.5%), and arthralgia (65.0%). The AE rate decreased from 58.3 events per person-year in the parent studies to 18.6 events per person-year in the extension study.ConclusionsPegvaliase treatment in adults with PKU produced meaningful and persistent reductions in mean plasma Phe concentration with a manageable safety profile for most subjects that continued with long-term treatment.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, {""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT00924703"",""term_id"":""NCT00924703""}}NCT00924703.

In this work, we introduce a dried spot activity assay for quantifying butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) specific activity which is BChE activity normalized to the total protein content in a sample spot. The method was demonstrated with blood, serum, and plasma spotted on specimen collection devices (cards) which were extracted to measure total protein and BChE activity using a modified Ellman assay. Activity recovered from dried spots was ∼80% of the initial spotted activity for blood and >90% for plasma and serum. Measuring total protein in the sample and calculating specific activity substantially improved quantification and reduced intra-spot variability.Analyte stability of nerve agent adducts was also evaluated, and the results obtained via BChE-specific activity measurements were confirmed by quantification of BChE adducts using a previously established LC-MS/MS method. The spotted samples were up to 10-times more resistant to degradation compared to unspotted control samples when measuring BChE inhibition by the nerve agents sarin and VX. Using this method, both BChE activity and adducts can be accurately measured from a dried sample spot. This use of a dried sample spot with normalization to total protein is robust, demonstrates decreased intra-spot variability without the need to control for initial sample volume, and enhances analyte stability.Keywords: Butyrylcholinesterase activity, Enzyme inhibition, Protein adducts, Dried blood spots, Organophosphorus nerve agents",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4517423/,abstract

We speculated that the late-onset PKU is caused by 2 kinds of metabolic dysfunction synergistically, especially a short period of irregular diet directly caused clinical symptoms.Patient concerns:A 21-year old Asian male patient demonstrated subacute leukodystrophy and visual-spatial disorders of late onset in adulthood.Diagnoses:Phenylketonuria combined with homocysteinmia, who presented with heterozygous mutations in gene encoding PAH p.G247R (c.739G>C) and p.Y204C (c.611A>G), along with homozygous mutation of gene encoding MTHFR c.677C>T.Interventions:The patient was treated with cobalamine (500 μg/day), vitamin B6 (30 mg/day), folate (5 mg/day) and encouraged to follow a protein-restricted diet.Outcomes:Visual disorientation and cognitive function showed improvement. Head MR showed similar resolution with the original lesion.

Technological advances have stimulated the development of screening programmes to include more conditions, subsequently changing the information required and potential benefit-risk trade-offs driving participation. Quantifying preferences for screening programmes can provide programme commissioners with data to understand potential demand, the drivers of this demand, information provision required to support the programmes and the extent to which preferences differ in a population. This study aimed to identify published studies eliciting preferences for antenatal and newborn screening programmes and provide an overview of key methods and findings.MethodsA systematic search of electronic databases for key terms identified eligible studies (discrete choice experiments (DCEs) or best-worst scaling (BWS) studies related to antenatal/newborn testing/screening published between 1990 and October 2018). Data were systematically extracted, tabulated and summarised in a narrative review.ResultsA total of 19 studies using a DCE or BWS to elicit preferences for antenatal (n = 15; 79%) and newborn screening (n = 4; 21%) programmes were identified. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe (n = 12; 63%) but there were some examples from North America (n = 2; 11%) and Australia (n = 2; 11%). Attributes most commonly included were accuracy of screening (n = 15; 79%) and when screening occurred (n = 13; 68%). Other commonly occurring attributes included information content (n = 11; 58%) and risk of miscarriage (n = 10; 53%). Pregnant women (n = 11; 58%) and healthcare professionals (n = 11; 58%) were the most common study samples. Ten studies (53%) compared preferences across different respondents. Two studies (11%) made comparisons between countries.

The present study sought to characterize infant mortality related to IEMs known to cause SUDI disaggregated by each of the regions of Brazil.MethodsThis was a descriptive, cross-sectional, population-based study of data obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of Health Mortality Information System (SIM). Death records were obtained for all infants (age < 1 year) who died in Brazil in 2002–2014 in whom the underlying cause of death was listed as ICD-10 codes E70 (Disorders of aromatic amino-acid metabolism), E71 (Disorders of branched-chain amino-acid metabolism and fatty-acid metabolism), E72 (Other disorders of amino-acid metabolism), or E74 (Other disorders of carbohydrate metabolism), which are known to be associated with SUDI.ResultsFrom 2002 to 2014, 199 deaths of infants aged < 1 year were recorded in the SIM with an underlying cause corresponding to one of the IEMs of interest. The prevalence of IEM-related deaths was 0.67 per 10,000 live births (0.58–0.77).

These amino acids and their metabolism are linked to the synthesis of a variety of secondary metabolites, a subset of which are involved in numerous anabolic pathways responsible for the synthesis of pigment compounds, plant hormones and biological polymers, to name a few. In addition, these metabolites derived from the AAA pathways mediate the transmission of nervous signals, quench reactive oxygen species in the brain, and are involved in the vast palette of animal coloration among others pathways. The AAA and metabolites derived from them also have integral roles in the health of both plants and animals. This review delineates the de novo biosynthesis of the AAA by microbes and plants, and the branching out of AAA metabolism into major secondary metabolic pathways in plants such as the phenylpropanoid pathway. Organisms that do not possess the enzymatic machinery for the de novo synthesis of AAA must obtain these primary metabolites from their diet. Therefore, the metabolism of AAA by the host animal and the resident microflora are important for the health of all animals. In addition, the AAA metabolite-mediated host-pathogen interactions in general, as well as potential beneficial and harmful AAA-derived compounds produced by gut bacteria are discussed. Apart from the AAA biosynthetic pathways in plants and microbes such as the shikimate pathway and the tryptophan pathway, this review also deals with AAA catabolism in plants, AAA degradation via the monoamine and kynurenine pathways in animals, and AAA catabolism via the 3-aryllactate and kynurenine pathways in animal-associated microbes. Emphasis will be placed on structural and functional aspects of several key AAA-related enzymes, such as shikimate synthase, chorismate mutase, anthranilate synthase, tryptophan synthase, tyrosine aminotransferase, dopachrome tautomerase, radical dehydratase, and type III CoA-transferase.

However, IT-IEM still require intense patient and caregiver effort in terms of strict dietetic and pharmacological treatment, and the threat of metabolic crises is always present. Furthermore, crises can affect the central nervous system (CNS), leading to cognitive, behavioural and psychiatric sequelae. Consequently, the well-being of the patients warrants consideration from both a medical and a psychosocial viewpoint by assessing health-related quality of life (HrQoL), psychological adjustment, and adaptive functioning. To date, an overview of findings on these topics for IT-IEM is lacking. We therefore aimed to systematically review the research on HrQoL, psychological adjustment, and adaptive functioning in patients with IT-IEM.MethodsRelevant databases were searched with predefined keywords. Study selection was conducted in two steps based on predefined criteria. Two independent reviewers completed the selection and data extraction.ResultsEleven articles met the inclusion criteria. Studies were of varying methodological quality and used different assessment measures. Findings on HrQoL were inconsistent, with some showing lower and others showing higher or equal HrQoL for IT-IEM patients compared to norms.

To improve translational success, one strategy is to select novel targets for which there is proof of clinical relevance, either genetically through heritable traits, or pharmacologically. Such an approach by definition yields targets with high clinical validity. The biology of these targets can be elucidated in animal models before returning to the patients with a refined therapeutic. For optimal treatment, having biomarkers of drug action available is also a plus. Here we describe a case study in rational drug design: the use of controlled inhibition of peripheral tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis to reduce abnormal chronic pain states without altering nociceptive-protective pain. Initially identified in a population of patients with low back pain, the association between BH4 production and chronic pain has been confirmed in more than 12 independent cohorts, through a common haplotype (present in 25% of Caucasians) of the rate-limiting enzyme for BH4 synthesis, GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1). Genetic tools in mice have demonstrated that both injured sensory neurons and activated macrophages engage increased BH4 synthesis to cause chronic pain. GCH1 is an obligate enzyme for de novo BH4 production. Therefore, inhibiting GCH1 activity eliminates all BH4 production, affecting the synthesis of multiple neurotransmitters and signaling molecules and interfering with physiological function. In contrast, targeting the last enzyme of the BH4 synthesis pathway, sepiapterin reductase (SPR), allows reduction of pathological BH4 production without completely blocking physiological BH4 synthesis. Systemic SPR inhibition in mice has not revealed any safety concerns to date, and available genetic and pharmacologic data suggest similar responses in humans. Finally, because it is present in vivo only when SPR is inhibited, sepiapterin serves as a reliable biomarker of target engagement, allowing potential quantification of drug efficacy. The emerging development of therapeutics that target BH4 synthesis to treat chronic pain illustrates the power of combining human and mouse genetics: human genetic studies for clinical selection of relevant targets, coupled with causality studies in mice, allowing the rational engineering of new analgesics.Keywords: Chronic pain, Genetics, Mouse models, Tetrahydrobiopterin, Sepiapterin reductase, Analgesics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5799129/,abstract

Recent care guidelines recommend essential fatty acid status is monitored in patients with PKU but access to such testing is limited. We hypothesized that information obtained on diet history would identify PKU adults with suboptimal levels of n3LCPUFA.Methods: A 12-month single site prospective study was completed including 35 adults (age 18–46) attending a clinic for adults with inborn errors of metabolism. Levels of n3LCPUFA were correlated with estimated intake using a published food frequency questionnaire. n3LCPUFA levels were tested at a commercial laboratory and values > one SD below the laboratory mean value were considered suboptimal.Results: Mean levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were lower and levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and alpha-linoleic acid (ALA) higher in subjects with PKU than in laboratory controls. n3LCPUFA levels correlated with estimated intake (p <0.002). Diet history had a positive predictive value of 93% and negative predictive value of 90% to identify subjects with suboptimal n3LCPUFA levels.Conclusions: Diet history is sufficient to predict adult subjects who may have low DHA levels and can be used to target testing or supplementation to those at risk. DHA levels are low despite high levels of ALA suggesting that supplementation, if indicated, should be with preformed DHA rather than with its precursors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4470952/,abstract

Underlying reasons of such serious maladies can be summarized as the paucity of appropriate analysis methods and subsequent treatment strategies due to the limited access of centralized and equipped health care facilities for diagnosis. Biosensors hold great impact to turn our current analytical methods into diagnostic strategies by restructuring their sensing module for the detection of biomolecules, especially nano-sized objects such as protein biomarkers and viruses. Unquestionably, current sensing platforms require continuous updates to address growing challenges in the diagnosis of viruses as viruses change quickly and spread largely from person-to-person, indicating the urgency of early diagnosis. Some of the challenges can be classified in biological barriers (specificity, low number of targets, and biological matrices) and technological limitations (detection limit, linear dynamic range, stability, and reliability), as well as economical aspects that limit their implementation into resource-scarce settings. In this review, the principle and types of biosensors and their applications in the diagnosis of distinct infectious diseases were comprehensively explained. The deployment of current biosensors into resource-scarce settings is further discussed for virus detection by elaborating the pros and cons of existing methods as a conclusion and future perspective.Keywords: biosensor, medical applications, virus detection",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6627152/,abstract
710,10.1681/ASN.2016050508,28739648,"Go to:AbstractAKI is a frequent condition that involves renal microcirculation impairment, infiltration of inflammatory cells with local production of proinflammatory cytokines, and subsequent epithelial disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PPARGC1A), a coactivator of the transcription factor PPAR-γ that controls mitochondrial biogenesis and function, has a pivotal role in the early dysfunction of the proximal tubule and the subsequent renal repair. Here, we evaluated the potential role of hepatocyte nuclear factor–1β (HNF-1β) in regulating PPARGC1A expression in AKI. In mice, endotoxin injection to induce AKI also induced early and transient inflammation and PPARGC1A inhibition, which overlapped with downregulation of the HNF-1β transcriptional network. In vitro, exposure of proximal tubule cells to the inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α led to inhibition of HNF-1β transcriptional activity. Moreover, inhibition of HNF-1β significantly reduced PPARGC1A expression and altered mitochondrial morphology and respiration in proximal tubule cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and PCR analysis confirmed HNF-1β binding to the Ppargc1a promoter in mouse kidneys. We also demonstrated downregulation of renal PPARGC1A expression in a patient with an HNF1B germinal mutation. Thus, we propose that HNF-1β links extracellular inflammatory signals to mitochondrial dysfunction during AKI partly via PPARGC1A signaling. Our findings further strengthen the view of HNF1B-related nephropathy as a mitochondrial disorder in adulthood.Keywords: HNF1B, acute kidney injury, mitochondria, PPARGC1A",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5661272/,abstract

These cells likely possess alternative UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanisms. Here we identify a secreted enzyme, peptidase M20 domain containing 1 (PM20D1), that is enriched in UCP1+ versus UCP1- adipocytes. We demonstrate that PM20D1 is a bidirectional enzyme in vitro, catalyzing both the condensation of fatty acids and amino acids to generate N-acyl amino acids and also the reverse hydrolytic reaction. N-acyl amino acids directly bind mitochondria and function as endogenous uncouplers of UCP1-independent respiration. Mice with increased circulating PM20D1 have augmented respiration and increased N-acyl amino acids in blood. Lastly, administration of N-acyl amino acids to mice improves glucose homeostasis and increases energy expenditure.

Urine samples (100 µl, containing 2.5 mmol/l creatinine) were taken from patients with IMDs. The collected urine was then treated using a two-step derivatization method (with oximation and silylation at room temperature), where urea and protein were removed. In the first step of the derivatization, α-ketoacids and α-aldehyde acids were prepared by oximation using novel oximation reagents. The second-step of the derivatization was that residues were silylated for analysis. Urine samples were examined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and a retention time-locking technique. The simultaneous analysis and identification of >400 metabolites in >130 types of IMD was possible from the GC/MS results, where the IMDs included phenylketonuria, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency, β-ureidopropionase deficiency and mitochondrial metabolic disorders. This method was demonstrated to have good repeatability. Considering α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) as an example, the relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the α-KG retention time and peak area were 0.8 and 3.9%, respectively, the blank spiked recovery rate was between 89.6 and 99.8%, and the RSD was ≤7.5% (n=5). The method facilitates the analysis of thermally non-stable and semi-volatile metabolites in urine, and greatly expands the range of materials that can be synchronously screened by GC/MS.

The aim of the present study was to investigate correlations among TH levels, neurodevelopmental outcomes and white matter (WM) microstructure in premature infants. The authors designed a cohort study recruiting 81 premature infants (age, 23–35 weeks). A total of 17 were born with a gestational age (GA) <30 weeks (early preterm group) and 64 of them were born with a GA ≥30 weeks (late preterm group). For outcome measurement, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels at 0, 18, and 24 h of admission were measured. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed using Bayley III test. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to explore the characterization of WM microstructure. The data demonstrated that GA, however not TSH level was associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes in the following 2 years. Fractional anisotrophy (FA) increased with TSH0 levels over anterior limb of internal capsule, while axial diffusivity decreased with TSH0 levels over splenium of corpus callosum (CC). The late preterm group had more intact WM integrity over the internal and external capsule (EC) in FA compared with the early preterm group. Infants with motor dysfunction had significantly increased mean diffusivity (MD) values at regions of interest in the genu and splenium of CC. The results of the present study demonstrated that GA, however not transient hypothyroidism influenced neurodevelopmental outcomes in the premature infants.

Adult outpatient clinics for inherited errors of metabolism can help to achieve this task, but experience is limited. Ten years after establishment of a coordinated transition process and specialised adult care for inherited metabolic diseases, adult PKU care was evaluated with respect to metabolic control, therapy satisfaction, life satisfaction, sociodemographic data, economical welfare as well as pregnancy outcome.MethodsAll PKU patients transferred from paediatric to adult care between 2005 and 2015 were identified. A retrospective data analysis and a cross-sectional survey in a sub-cohort of 30 patients including a questionnaire for assessing quality of life (FLZm) were performed as a single-centre investigation at the metabolic department of the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney-U-test, t-test for independent samples, ANOVA and chi square test were used as appropriate.Results96 PKU patients (56 females/40 males; median age 32 years, range 18–62) were included. In the last 3-year period, 81 % of the transferred patients still kept contact to the adult care centre. Metabolic control was stable over the evaluation period and dried blood phenylalanine concentrations mostly remained within the therapeutic range (median 673.0 μmol/l, range 213.0–1381.1). Sociodemographic data, economical welfare and life satisfaction data were comparable to data from the general population. However, differences could be revealed when splitting the cohort according to time of diagnosis and to management during childhood. 83 % of the PKU adults were satisfied with the transition process and current adult care. 25 completed pregnancies were supervised; three newborns, born after unplanned pregnancy, showed characteristic symptoms of maternal PKU syndrome.ConclusionsContinuous care for adult PKU patients in a specialized outpatient clinic is successful, leading to good to satisfactory metabolic control and social outcomes. Uninterrupted good metabolic treatment throughout childhood and adolescence positively influences educational, professional and economic success in later life.

The knowledge of Phe intercalation parameters can be instrumental in understanding various membrane processes triggered by interactions with Phe, in particular the early events leading to the formation of nucleation/docking sites for the self-assembly of Phe amyloid fibrils at the membrane surface.ResultsIn this study, we used monolayers of phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) and phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) to mimic the membrane outer leaflet. Its initial interaction with Phe was modeled by injecting Phe into the aqueous phase underneath the monolayer. Constant pressure insertion assays augmented with epifluorescence microscopy imaging were used to monitor Phe intercalation. Our primary goal was to determine the Phe intercalation area, APhe. Two values were obtained for APhe, 33 ± 2 and 48 ± 3 Å2.ConclusionsPhe appeared to discriminate between DPPE and DPPC packing, and use two modes of intercalation. The area of APhe 33 ± 2 Å2 is consistent with a Phe monomer intercalating into membrane by inserting the phenyl ring nearly normal to the membrane surface. This mode has been found to operate in DPPE membranes. For DPPC membranes however, the value of APhe = 48 ± 3 Å2 suggests that, from saline, Phe tends to intercalate as a larger species plausibly dragging along a counterion, Na+, in a Na+(Phe) complex.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13628-018-0047-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylalanine, Langmuir monolayer, Epifluorescence microscopy, Amino acid/phospholipid interaction, Amyloid fibrils",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6237005/,abstract

Inclusion criteria were that studies be published in English or Italian during the period 2000–2015 and carried out in European or extra-European countries (Canada, USA, Australia, or New Zealand).Results: 148 genetic programs were identified in 117 articles and were delivered mostly in the UK (59, 40%), USA (35, 24%) or Australia (16, 11%). The programs were available nationally (66; 45%), regionally (49; 33%) or in urban areas (21, 14%). Ninety-six (64%) of the programs were integrated into healthcare systems, 48 (32.21%) were pilot programs and five (3%) were direct-to-consumer genetic services.

Healthcare professionals with different backgrounds are increasingly engaged in the provision of genetic services. Based on which healthcare professionals have prominent roles in the respective patient care pathways, genetic programs were classified into five models: (i) the geneticists model; (ii) the primary care model; (iii) the medical specialist model; (iv) the population screening programs model; and (v) the direct-to-consumer model.Conclusions: New models of genetic service delivery are currently under development worldwide to address the increasing demand for accessible and affordable services. These models require the integration of genetics into all medical specialties, collaboration among different healthcare professionals, and the redistribution of professional roles.

Therefore, new cost-effective and reliable test methods are needed. Determination of HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA from dried blood spots samples could represent one such method. Here we examined whether anti-HCV could be detected—and HCV-RNA quantified—from dried blood spots, sent by regular mail. We also investigated, if IP-10 determined from dried blood spots correlated with fibrosis progression appraised by transient elastography.MethodForty chronic HCV infected patients were consecutively enrolled. At baseline and after six months, dried blood spots were prepared from blood collected by venous puncture, dried for 4–6 hours, then stored in gas-impermeable plastic bags with a desiccator, before being sent by regular mail. At each visit, approximately six months apart, paired venous samples was obtained and analyzed for anti-HCV, HCV-RNA and IP-10.ResultsAnti-HCV was found in 66/67 of the dried blood spots. Sixty-six paired samples were available for HCV-RNA analysis. A statistically significant correlation was found between log HCV-RNA concentrations in plasma, and log HCV-RNA obtained from (P < 0.0001, Pearson’s R 0.6788, R2 0.4607). HCV-RNA, derived from DBS samples, was lower than the corresponding plasma concentration, reflected by a Bland-Altman bias of 3 with SD of bias ± 0.6472. We found no correlation between IP-10 and fibrosis progression.ConclusionsWe identified anti-HCV in 66/67samples, and quantified IP-10 and HCV-RNA from dried blood spots, dried at room temperature and sent by regular mail. HCV-RNA concentrations from the dried blood spots were lower than corresponding plasma values; a probable result of heparin coated test tubes. We found no correlation between IP-10 and fibrosis progression. Overall, dried blood spots could be a cost-effective and easy-to-use alternative to standard tests for the diagnosis of HCV infections.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6067740/,abstract

It is perceived as a rare condition. However it affects 1 in 250 of the population globally, making it an important public health concern. In communities with founder effects, higher disease prevalences are observed.We discuss the genetic basis of familial hypercholesterolaemia, examining the distribution of variants known to be associated with the condition across the exons of the genes LDLR, ApoB, PCSK9 and LDLRAP1. We also discuss screening programmes for familial hypercholesterolaemia and their cost-effectiveness. Diagnosis typically occurs using one of the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DCLN), Simon Broome Register (SBR) or Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death (MEDPED) criteria, each of which requires a different set of patient data. New cases can be identified by screening the family members of an index case that has been identified as a result of referral to a lipid clinic in a process called cascade screening. Alternatively, universal screening may be used whereby a population is systematically screened.It is currently significantly more cost effective to identify familial hypercholesterolaemia cases through cascade screening than universal screening. However, the cost of sequencing patient DNA has fallen dramatically in recent years and if the rate of progress continues, this may change.Keywords: Familial hypercholesterolaemia, FH, cascade screening, screening, cholesterol, universal screening, atherosclerosis, CVD, CHD",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4833930/,abstract

The investigations were performed in five groups: sham, ovariectomized (OVX) rats without treatment, low-dose RC vinegar (LRV)-treated OVX rats, high-dose RC vinegar (HRV)-treated OVX rats and alendronate (ALEN)-treated OVX rats. The efficacy of RC vinegar was evaluated using physical, biochemical, histological and metabolomic parameters. Compared to the OVX rats, the LRV and HRV groups showed positive effects on the aforementioned parameters, indicating estrogen regulation. Plasma metabolome analysis of the groups using gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-TOF-MS (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) with multivariate analysis revealed 19 and 16 metabolites, respectively. Notably, the levels of butyric acid, phenylalanine, glucose, tryptophan and some lysophosphatidylcholines were marginally increased in RC vinegar-treated groups compared to OVX. However, the pattern of metabolite levels in RC vinegar-treated groups was found similar to ALEN, but differed significantly from that in sham group.

When considered collectively, they account for an important public health burden, which is frequently under-recognised. To document the collective frequency and health burden of rare single gene disorders, it is necessary to aggregate them into large manageable groupings and take account of their family implications, effective interventions and service needs.

People with cancer may experience nausea and vomiting whilst receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or whilst in the palliative phase of illness.ObjectivesTo assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine when used as an antiemetic in the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting related to cancer in adults.Search methodsWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase for published data on 20th September 2017, as well as ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for unpublished trials. We checked reference lists, and contacted experts in the field and study authors.Selection criteriaWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of olanzapine versus any comparator with or without adjunct therapies for the prevention or treatment, or both, of nausea or vomiting in people with cancer aged 18 years or older, in any setting, of any duration, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.Data collection and analysisWe used standard Cochrane methodology. We used GRADE to assess quality of evidence for each main outcome. We extracted data for absence of nausea or vomiting and frequency of serious adverse events as primary outcomes. We extracted data for patient perception of treatment, other adverse events, somnolence and fatigue, attrition, nausea or vomiting severity, breakthrough nausea and vomiting, rescue antiemetic use, and nausea and vomiting as secondary outcomes at specified time points.Main resultsWe included 14 RCTs (1917 participants) from high‐, middle‐ and low‐income countries, representing over 24 different cancers. Thirteen studies were in chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting. Oral olanzapine was administered during highly emetogenic (HEC) or moderately emetogenic (MEC) chemotherapy (12 studies); chemoradiotherapy (one study); or palliation (one study). Eight studies await classification and 13 are ongoing.The main comparison was olanzapine versus placebo/no treatment. Other comparisons were olanzapine versus NK1 antagonist, prokinetic, 5‐HT3 antagonist or dexamethasone.We assessed all but one study as having one or more domains that were at high risk of bias. Eight RCTs with fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm, and 10 RCTs with issues related to blinding, were at high risk of bias. We downgraded GRADE assessments due to imprecision, inconsistency and study limitations.Olanzapine versus placebo/no treatmentPrimary outcomesOlanzapine probably doubles the likelihood of no nausea or vomiting during chemotherapy from 25% to 50% (risk ratio (RR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 2.47; 561 participants; 3 studies; solid tumours; HEC or MEC therapy; moderate‐quality evidence) when added to standard therapy. Number needed to treat for additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 5 (95% CI 3.3 ‐ 6.6).It is uncertain if olanzapine increases the risk of serious adverse events (absolute risk difference 0.7% more, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.2) (RR 2.46, 95% CI 0.48 to 12.55; 7 studies, 889 participants, low‐quality evidence).Secondary outcomesFour studies reported patient perception of treatment. One study (48 participants) reported no difference in patient preference. Four reported quality of life but data were insufficient for meta‐analysis.Olanzapine may increase other adverse events (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.96; 332 participants; 4 studies; low‐quality evidence) and probably increases somnolence and fatigue compared to no treatment or placebo (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.30 to 4.18; anticipated absolute risk 8.2% more, 95% CI 1.9 to 18.8; 464 participants; 5 studies; moderate‐quality evidence). Olanzapine probably does not affect all‐cause attrition (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.73; 943 participants; 8 studies; I² = 0%). We are uncertain if olanzapine increases attrition due to adverse events (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 70.16; 422 participants; 6 studies). No participants withdrew due to lack of efficacy.We are uncertain if olanzapine reduces breakthrough nausea and vomiting (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.47; 501 participants; 2 studies; I² = 54%) compared to placebo or no treatment. No studies reported 50% reduction in severity of nausea or vomiting, use of rescue antiemetics, or attrition.We are uncertain of olanzapine's efficacy in reducing acute nausea or vomiting. Olanzapine probably reduces delayed nausea (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.09; 585 participants; 3 studies) and vomiting (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.42; 702 participants; 5 studies).Subgroup analysis: 5 mg versus 10 mgPlanned subgroup analyses found that it is unclear if 5 mg is as effective an antiemetic as 10 mg. There is insufficient evidence to exclude the possibility that 5 mg may confer a lower risk of somnolence and fatigue than 10 mg.Other comparisonsOne study (20 participants) compared olanzapine versus NK1 antagonists. We observed no difference in any reported outcomes.One study (112 participants) compared olanzapine versus a prokinetic (metoclopramide), reporting that olanzapine may increase freedom from overall nausea (RR 2.95, 95% CI 1.73 to 5.02) and overall vomiting (RR 3.03, 95% CI 1.78 to 5.14).One study (62 participants) examined olanzapine versus 5‐HT3 antagonists, reporting olanzapine may increase the likelihood of 50% or greater reduction in nausea or vomiting at 48 hours (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.97) and 24 hours (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.34).One study (229 participants) compared olanzapine versus dexamethasone, reporting that olanzapine may reduce overall nausea (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.18), overall vomiting (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.48), delayed nausea (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.08) and delayed vomiting (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.45).Authors' conclusionsThere is moderate‐quality evidence that oral olanzapine probably increases the likelihood of not being nauseous or vomiting during chemotherapy from 25% to 50% in adults with solid tumours, in addition to standard therapy, compared to placebo or no treatment. There is uncertainty whether it increases serious adverse events. It may increase the likelihood of other adverse events, probably increasing somnolence and fatigue. There is uncertainty about relative benefits and harms of 5 mg versus 10 mg.We identified only RCTs describing oral administration.

This allowed for PK conclusions to be seamlessly drawn across the clinical program without impact from the choice of matrix. This integrated information package (in vitro, bioanalytical and clinical) was presented to major regulatory agencies (FDA and EMA) for regulatory input.

Genetic factors play a role in most CHDs; however, identification of these factors has been historically slow due to technological limitations and incomplete understanding of the impact of human genomic variation on normal and abnormal cardiovascular development. The advent of chromosome microarray (CMA) brought tremendous gains in identifying chromosome abnormalities in a variety of human disorders and is now considered part of a standard evaluation for individuals with multiple congenital anomalies and/or neurodevelopmental disorders. Several studies investigating use of CMA found that this technology can identify pathogenic copy-number variations (CNVs) in up to 15–20% of patients with CHDs with other congenital anomalies. However, there have been fewer studies exploring the use of CMA for patients with isolated CHDs. Recent studies have shown that the diagnostic yield of CMA in individuals with seemingly isolated CHD is lower than in individuals with CHDs and additional anomalies. Nevertheless, positive CMA testing in this group supports chromosome variation as one mechanism underlying the development of isolated, non-syndromic CHD – either as a causative or risk-influencing genetic factor. CMA has also identified novel genomic variation in CHDs, shedding light on candidate genes and pathways involved in cardiac development and malformations. Additional studies are needed to further address this issue. Early genetic diagnosis can enhance the medical management of patients and potentially provide crucial information about recurrence. This information is critical for genetic counseling of patients and family members. In this review, we review CMA for the non-genetics cardiology provider, offer a summary of CNV in isolated CHDs, and advocate for the use of CMA as part of the cardiovascular genetics evaluation of patients with isolated CHDs. We also provide perspective regarding the benefits and challenges that lie ahead for this model in the clinical setting.Keywords: chromosome microarray, congenital heart defects, copy-number variation, genetic counseling, clinical genetics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4905945/,abstract

The restrictive nature of the PKU diet may expose patients to sub-optimal nutritional intake and deficiencies which may impact normal brain function. A systematic review of the published literature was carried out, where possible with meta-analysis, to compare the status of nutrients (Nutrients: DHA, EPA phospholipids, selenium, vitamins B6, B12, E, C, A, D, folic acid, choline, uridine, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, iodine and cholesterol) known to be important for brain development and functioning between individuals with PKU and healthy controls.ResultsOf 1534 publications identified, 65 studies met the entry criteria. Significantly lower levels of DHA, EPA and cholesterol were found for PKU patients compared to healthy controls. No significant differences in zinc, vitamins B12, E and D, calcium, iron and magnesium were found between PKU patients and controls. Because of considerable heterogeneity, the meta-analyses findings for folate and selenium were not reported. Due to an insufficient number of publications (< 4) no meta-analysis was undertaken for vitamins A, C and B6, choline, uridine, iodine and phospholipids.ConclusionsThe current data show that PKU patients have lower availability of DHA, EPA and cholesterol. Compliance with the phe-restricted diet including the micronutrient fortified protein substitute (PS) is essential to ensure adequate micronutrient status. Given the complexity of the diet, patients’ micronutrient and fatty acid status should be continuously monitored, with a particular focus on patients who are non-compliant or poorly compliant with their PS. Given their key role in brain function, assessment of the status of nutrients where limited data was found (e.g. choline, iodine) should be undertaken. Standardised reporting of studies in PKU would strengthen the output of meta-analysis and so better inform best practice for this rare condition.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13023-018-0839-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylketonuria (PKU), Brain, Plasma, Nutrient, Nutritional requirement, Metabolism, Fatty acids, Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Eicosapentanoic acid (EPA), Cholesterol, choline, Vitamins, Micronutrients, phospholipids, compliance",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6020171/,abstract

Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 53: 255–264, 2015). Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a cofactor that promotes eNOS coupling. Current clinical strategies typically invoke initiating treatment after the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, rather than prophylactically. The major purpose of this study was to determine whether starting treatment with an oral BH4 compound, sapropterin dihydrochloride (sapropterin), after the onset of pulmonary hypertension would recouple eNOS in the pulmonary vasculature and ameliorate disease progression in chronically hypoxic piglets. Normoxic (control) and hypoxic piglets were studied. Some hypoxic piglets received oral sapropterin starting on day 3 of hypoxia and continued throughout an additional 7 days of hypoxic exposure. Catheters were placed for hemodynamic measurements, and pulmonary arteries were dissected to assess eNOS dimer-to-monomer ratios (a measure of eNOS coupling), NO production, and superoxide (O2·−) generation. Although higher than in normoxic controls, pulmonary vascular resistance was lower in sapropterin-treated hypoxic piglets than in untreated hypoxic piglets. Consistent with eNOS recoupling, eNOS dimer-to-monomer ratios and NO production were greater and O2·− generation was less in pulmonary arteries from sapropterin-treated than untreated hypoxic animals. When started after disease onset, oral sapropterin treatment inhibits chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension at least in part by recoupling eNOS in the pulmonary vasculature of newborn piglets. Rescue treatment with sapropterin may be an effective strategy to inhibit further development of pulmonary hypertension in newborn infants suffering from chronic cardiopulmonary conditions associated with episodes of prolonged hypoxia.Keywords: nitric oxide signaling, sapropterin dihydrochloride, superoxide, pulmonary resistance arteries",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5142125/,abstract

Hepatic estrogen receptors and the release of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) are critical links between liver function and the reproductive system. However, the role of liver in pubertal development is not fully understood. To explore this question, we applied transcriptomic analyses to liver samples of pre- and post-pubertal Brahman heifers and identified differentially expressed (DE) genes and genes encoding transcription factors (TFs). Differential expression of genes suggests potential biological mechanisms and pathways linking liver function to puberty. The analyses identified 452 DE genes and 82 TF with significant contribution to differential gene expression by using a regulatory impact factor metric. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor was observed as the most down-regulated gene (P = 0.003) in post-pubertal heifers and we propose this gene influences pubertal development in Brahman heifers. Additionally, co-expression network analysis provided evidence for three TF as key regulators of liver function during pubertal development: the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6, PBX homeobox 2, and polybromo 1. Pathway enrichment analysis identified transforming growth factor-beta and Wnt signaling pathways as significant annotation terms for the list of DE genes and TF in the co-expression network.

741,10.1172/jci.insight.121762,30046012,"Go to:AbstractThe neuropathological effects of phenylketonuria (PKU) stem from the inability of the body to metabolize excess phenylalanine (Phe), resulting in accumulation of Phe in the blood and brain. Since the kidney normally reabsorbs circulating amino acids with high efficiency, we hypothesized that preventing the renal uptake of Phe might provide a disposal pathway that could lower systemic Phe levels. SLC6A19 is a neutral amino acid transporter responsible for absorption of the majority of free Phe in the small intestine and reuptake of Phe by renal proximal tubule cells. Transgenic KO mice lacking SLC6A19 have elevated levels of Phe and other amino acids in their urine but are otherwise healthy. Here, we crossed the Pahenu2 mouse model of PKU with the Slc6a19-KO mouse. These mutant/KO mice exhibited abundant excretion of Phe in the urine and an approximately 70% decrease in plasma Phe levels. Importantly, brain Phe levels were decreased by 50%, and the levels of key neurotransmitters were increased in the mutant/KO mice. In addition, a deficit in spatial working memory and markers of neuropathology were corrected. Finally, treatment of Pahenu2 mice with Slc6a19 antisense oligonucleotides lowered Phe levels. The results suggest that inhibition of SLC6A19 may represent a novel approach for the treatment of PKU and related aminoacidopathies.Keywords: Metabolism, TherapeuticsKeywords: Amino acid metabolism, Genetic diseases",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124451/,abstract

The increased need for the use of personalised nutrition in patients is increasing and research is being made on its possible effects. However, research on nutrigenomics and in particular, obesity is still ongoing. Following a current metanalysis on thirty-eight nutrigenomics genes, it seems that a definite association between the genes usually examined in nutrigenomics testing and several diet-related diseases is lacking, even though there is a limited number of studies associating them. In 2014, literature search results in a great number of studies on several polymorphisms. This heterogeneity could only show the way towards new research aims. Nutrigenomics was born due to the need to move from Epidemiology and Physiology to Molecular Biology and Genetics. Currently, there are steps that need to be considered in order for nutrigenomics to be applied: the genes, the gene/protein network, and the strategy towards the determination of the nutrients' influence on gene/protein expression. It is certainly an interesting evolving science with many areas to be investigated further and from different perspectives, as it involves ethics, medicine, genetics and nutrition.Keywords: Nutrigenomics, Nutrition, Personalised nutrition, Personalised medicine, Science",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4745366/,abstract
745,10.21010/ajtcam.v14i4.15,28638875,"Go to:AbstractBackground:Whole body vibration (WBV) is a form of physical stimulation via mechanical vibrations transmitted to a subject. It is assumed that WBV induces sensory stimulation in cortical brain regions through the activation of skin and muscle receptors responding to the vibration. The effects of WBV on muscle strength are well described. However, little is known about the impact of WBV on the brain. Recently, it was shown in humans that WBV improves attention in an acute WBV protocol. Preclinical research is needed to unravel the underlying brain mechanism. As a first step, we examined whether chronic WBV improves attention in mice.Material and Methods:A custom made vibrating platform for mice with low intensity vibrations was used. Male CD1 mice (3 months of age) received five weeks WBV (30 Hz; 1.9 G), five days a week with sessions of five (n=12) or 30 (n=10) minutes. Control mice (pseudo-WBV; n=12 and 10 for the five and 30 minute sessions, respectively) were treated in a similar way, but did not receive the actual vibration. Object recognition tasks were used as an attention test (novel and spatial object recognition – the primary outcome measure). A Balance beam was used for motor performance, serving as a secondary outcome measure.Results:WBV sessions of five (but not WBV sessions of 30 minutes) improved balance beam performance (mice gained 28% in time needed to cross the beam) and novel object recognition (mice paid significantly more attention to the novel object) as compared to pseudo WBV, but no change was found for spatial object performance (mice did not notice the relocation). Although 30 minutes WBV sessions were not beneficial, it did not impair either attention or motor performance.Conclusion:These results show that brief sessions of WBV improve, next to motor performance, attention for object recognition, but not spatial cues of the objects. The selective improvement of attention in mice opens the avenue to unravel the underlying brain mechanisms.Keywords: motor performance, attention, novel object recognition, balance beam, chronic treatment",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5471459/,abstract

Recently Tran-Viet et al. proposed that heterozygosity for pathogenic SCO2 variants, including the common E140K variant, causes high-grade myopia. To investigate the association of SCO2 mutations with myopia, ophthalmic examinations were performed on 35 E140K carriers, one homozygous infant, and on a mouse model of Sco2 deficiency. Additionally, a screen for other putative effects of SCO2 heterozygosity was carried out by comparing the prevalence of the common E140K variant in a population of patients with undiagnosed diseases compatible with SCO2-related pathogenesis to that in a general population sample. High-grade myopia was not identified in any of the studied individuals. Of the carriers, 17 were emmetropic, and 18 possessed refractive errors. Additionally, no significant axial elongation indicative of high-grade myopia was found in mice carrying E129K (corresponding to E140K in humans) knock-in mutations. The prevalence of E140K carriers in the symptomatic cohort was evaluated as 1:103 (CI: 0.44–2.09) and did not differ significantly from the population prevalence (1:147, CI: 0.45–1.04).Our study demonstrates that heterozygosity for pathogenic SCO2 variants is not associated with high-grade myopia in either human patients or in mice.Keywords: E140K carrier, Myopia, SCO2 gene variant, SMA negative",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4864719/,abstract

SLC6A19 (B0AT1) is the major neutral amino acid transporter in the intestine and carries out the bulk of amino acid absorption from the diet. Mice lacking SLC6A19 show signs of protein restriction, have improved glucose tolerance, and are protected from diet-induced obesity. Pharmacological blockage of this transporter could be used to induce protein restriction and to treat metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. A few novel inhibitors of SLC6A19 have recently been identified using in vitro compound screening, but it remains unclear whether these compounds block the transporter in vivo. To evaluate the efficacy of SLC6A19 inhibitors biomarkers are required that can reliably detect successful inhibition of the transporter in mice. A gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics approach was used to discriminate global metabolite profiles in plasma, urine and faecal samples from SLC6A19ko and wt mice. Due to inefficient absorption in the intestine and lack of reabsorption in the kidney, significantly elevated amino acids levels were observed in urine and faecal samples. By contrast, a few neutral amino acids were reduced in the plasma of male SLC6A19ko mice as compared to other biological samples. Metabolites of bacterial protein fermentation such as p-cresol glucuronide and 3-indole-propionic acid were more abundant in SLC6A19ko mice, indicating protein malabsorption of dietary amino acids. Consistently, plasma appearance rates of [14C]-labelled neutral amino acids were delayed in SLC6A19ko mice as compared to wt after intra-gastric administration of a mixture of amino acids. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to validate the potential use of these metabolites as biomarkers.

Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that low accumbal D2 receptor (R) availability is a genetic risk factor of food compulsion-like behavior and that environmental conditions that induce compulsive eating alter D2R expression in the striatum. To this end, we measured D1R and D2R expression in the striatum and D1R, D2R and α1R levels in the medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, by western blot.ResultsExposure to environmental conditions induces compulsion-like eating behavior, depending on genetic background. This behavioral pattern is linked to decreased availability of accumbal D2R. Moreover, exposure to certain environmental conditions upregulates D2R and downregulates α1R in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, respectively, of compulsive animals. These findings confirm the function of gene-environment interplay in the manifestation of compulsive eating and support the hypothesis that low accumbal D2R availability is a “constitutive” genetic risk factor for compulsion-like eating behavior.

Blood was collected from asymptomatic and negative control subjects living in a Leishmania infantum- (Spain) and Leishmania donovani-endemic area (Bangladesh). After SLA-stimulation, three types of sample were prepared: frozen liquid plasma (−20 °C), and plasma dropped onto Protein Saver cards kept at −20 °C (DPS-FZ), and at ambient temperature (DPS-AT). The concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-2, CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL2 and CXCL8 in the thawed liquid plasma (TLP), DPS-FZ and DPS-AT samples were then determined. Strong correlations were seen between the TLP and DPS-FZ/AT samples for all the studied cytokines/chemokines in both the L. infantum and L. donovani areas. Protein Saver 903 cards would therefore appear to allow for the transport of SLA-stimulated plasma samples by courier at ambient temperature.

This study aimed to determine the incidence rates of OAs, FAODs, and AAs in Asian countries and Germany using selective screening and ENBS records.Materials and methodsSelective screening for IMDs using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and MS/MS was performed among patients suspected to be afflicted in Asian countries (including Japan, Vietnam, China, and India) between 2000 and 2015, and the results from different countries were compared. Similarly, ENBS results from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Germany were compared. Additionally, the results of selective screening and ENBS in Japan were compared.ResultsAmong 39,270 patients who underwent selective screening, IMDs were detected in 1170. Methylmalonic acidemia was frequently identified in several countries, including Japan (81/377 diagnosed IMDs), China (94/216 IMDs), and India (72/293 IMDs). In Vietnam, however, β-ketothiolase deficiency was particularly frequent (33/250 IMDs). ENBS yielded differences in overall IMD rates by country: 1:8557 in Japan, 1:7030 in Taiwan, 1:13,205 in South Korea, and 1:2200 in Germany. Frequently discovered diseases included propionic acidemia (PPA) and phenylketonuria (PKU) in Japan, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (MCCD) and PKU in Taiwan, MCCD and citrullinemia type I in South Korea, and PKU and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in Germany. Furthermore, in Japan, selective screening and ENBS yielded respective PPA frequencies of 14.7% and 49.4% among all organic acidemias.ConclusionThe incidence rates of IMDs vary by country.

As the hippocampus plays a key role in binding processes, we examined the influence of glucose on memory for object-location bindings.ObjectiveThis study aims to study how glucose modifies performance on an object-location memory task, a task that draws heavily on hippocampal function.MethodsThirty-one participants received 30 g glucose or placebo in a single 1-h session. After seeing between 3 and 10 objects (words or shapes) at different locations in a 9 × 9 matrix, participants attempted to immediately reproduce the display on a blank 9 × 9 matrix. Blood glucose was measured before drink ingestion, mid-way through the session, and at the end of the session.ResultsGlucose significantly improves object-location binding (d = 1.08) and location memory (d = 0.83), but not object memory (d = 0.51). Increasing working memory load impairs object memory and object-location binding, and word-location binding is more successful than shape-location binding, but the glucose improvement is robust across all difficulty manipulations. Within the glucose group, higher levels of circulating glucose are correlated with better binding memory and remembering the locations of successfully recalled objects.ConclusionsThe glucose improvements identified are consistent with a facilitative impact on hippocampal function. The findings are discussed in the context of the relationship between cognitive processes, hippocampal function, and the implications for glucose’s mode of action.Keywords: Glucose, Episodic memory, Spatial memory, Working memory, Object-location memory, Binding, Complexity, Hippocampus, Human",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4710657/,abstract

The LC-PUFAs docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid, found in high concentrations in the brain and retina, have potential beneficial effects on cognition, and motor and visual functions. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism. The treatment of PKU consists of a phenylalanine-free diet, which limits the intake of natural proteins of high biological value. In this systematic review, we summarize the available evidence supporting a role for LC-PUFA supplementation as an effective means of increasing LC-PUFA levels and improving visual and neurocognitive functions in PKU patients. Data from controlled trials of children and adults (up to 47 years of age) were obtained by searching the MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. For each selected study, the risk of bias was assessed applying the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration. The findings indicate that DHA supplementation in PKU patients from 2 weeks to 47 years of age improves DHA status and decreases visual evoked potential P100 wave latency in PKU children from 1 to 11 years old.

It is a lifelong condition affecting on the patient’s appearance, cognition, adaptive skills, physical growth, personality, body structure, and health. An infantile growth spurt and development of macrocephalia associated to hernias and respiratory infections are the key signs to an early identification of AGU. Progressive intellectual and physical disability is the main symptom leading to death usually before the age of 50 years.The disease is caused by the deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme glycosylasparaginase (aspartylglucosaminidase, AGA), which leads to a disorder in the degradation of glycoasparagines – aspartylglucosamine or other glycoconjugates with an aspartylglucosamine moiety at their reducing end – and accumulation of these undegraded glycoasparagines in tissues and body fluids. A single nucleotide change in the AGA gene resulting in a cysteine to serine substitution (C163S) in the AGA enzyme protein causes the deficiency of the glycosylasparaginase activity in the Finnish population. Homozygosity for the single nucleotide change causing the C163S mutation is responsible for 98% of the AGU cases in Finland simplifying the carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of the disorder in the Finnish population. A mouse strain, which completely lacks the Aga activity has been generated through targeted disruption of the Aga gene in embryonic stem cells. These Aga-deficient mice share most of the clinical, histopathologic and biochemical characteristics of human AGU disease. Treatment of AGU mice with recombinant AGA resulted in rapid correction of the pathophysiologic characteristics of AGU in non-neuronal tissues of the animals. The accumulation of aspartylglucosamine was reduced by up to 40% in the brain tissue of the animals depending on the age of the animals and the therapeutic protocol. Enzyme replacement trials on human AGU patients have not been reported so far.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the visual evoked potential (VEP) could be used as a noninvasive quantitative measure of cortical processing in children with 16p11.2 copy number variation.MethodsPattern-reversal VEPs were successfully recorded in 19 deletion carriers, 9 duplication carriers, and 13 typically developing children between the ages of 3 and 14 years. The stimulus was a black and white checkerboard (60’) that reversed contrast at 2 Hz. VEP responses were extracted from continuous EEG recorded using a high-density elasticized electrode net.ResultsQuantitative analysis of the VEP waveform revealed that, relative to controls, deletion carriers displayed increased amplitude and duplication carriers displayed diminished amplitude.

In this paper, a GC/MS based metabolomic approach was utilized to seek similar biomarkers by analyzing the urinary information in 62 ASDs patients compared with 62 non-ASDs controls in China, aged 1.5–7. Three compounds identified as 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic acid (HPHPA), 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3HPA), and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid (3HHA) were found in higher concentrations in autistic children than in the controls (p < 0.001).

In this work we use inhibitors of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity to search for further differences between these isoenzymes.

To evaluate this card, we applied influenza virus cell culture isolate supernatants to either the RNASound card or Whatman Grade No. 1 filter paper (GE Healthcare, Rydalmere, NSW, Australia) and compared the preservation to that of material stored in liquid form. Preservation was tested using influenza A and B viruses at two different storage temperatures [cool (2–8°C) or room temperature (18–22°C)] and these were compared with control material stored at -80°C, for 7, 14, or 28 days. The quality of the RNA recovered was assessed using real time RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The RNASound card was effective in preserving influenza RNA at room temperature for up to 28 days, with only a minor change in real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold values for selected gene targets when comparing between viruses applied to the card or stored at -80°C. Similar results were obtained with filter paper, whilst virus in liquid form performed the worst. Nevertheless, as the RNASound card also has the capability to inactivate viruses in addition to preserving RNA at room temperature for many weeks, this makes it feasible to send samples to laboratories using regular mail, and thus avoid the need for expensive shipping conditions requiring biohazard containers and dry ice.

SPR also mediates chemical redox cycling, catalyzing one-electron reduction of redox-active chemicals, including quinones and bipyridinium herbicides (e.g., menadione, 9,10-phenanthrenequinone, and diquat); rapid reaction of the reduced radicals with molecular oxygen generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using recombinant human SPR, sulfonamide- and sulfonylurea-based sulfa drugs were found to be potent noncompetitive inhibitors of both sepiapterin reduction and redox cycling. The most potent inhibitors of sepiapterin reduction (IC50s = 31–180 nM) were sulfasalazine, sulfathiazole, sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, and chlorpropamide. Higher concentrations of the sulfa drugs (IC50s = 0.37–19.4 μM) were required to inhibit redox cycling, presumably because of distinct mechanisms of sepiapterin reduction and redox cycling. In PC12 cells, which generate catecholamine and monoamine neurotransmitters via BH4-dependent amino acid hydroxylases, sulfa drugs inhibited both BH2/BH4 biosynthesis and redox cycling mediated by SPR. Inhibition of BH2/BH4 resulted in decreased production of dopamine and dopamine metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Sulfathiazole (200 μM) markedly suppressed neurotransmitter production, an effect reversed by BH4. These data suggest that SPR and BH4-dependent enzymes, are “off-targets” of sulfa drugs, which may underlie their untoward effects. The ability of the sulfa drugs to inhibit redox cycling may ameliorate ROS-mediated toxicity generated by redox active drugs and chemicals, contributing to their anti-inflammatory activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4352594/,abstract

Different PAH pathogenic variants occur in different ethnic groups with various frequencies and the incidence of the disease itself varies from country to country. In the Caucasus region of Russia, some ethnoses are geographically and culturally isolated from each other. The tradition of monoethnic marriages may cause decreased genetic variability in those populations. In the Karachay-Cherkess Republic (Russia), the highest incidence of phenylketonuria in the world has been detected (1:850 newborns) in the region and 1:332 among the titular nation Karachays. Here, we showed that this phenomenon is due to the widespread prevalence of the p.Arg261* variant. Its allele frequency among Karachay patients with PKU was 68.4% and the carrier frequency in Karachays was 1:16 healthy individuals. PAH haplotype analysis showed a unique common origin. The founder haplotype and mutation “age” were estimated by analyzing the linkage disequilibrium between p.Arg261* and extragenic short tandem repeat loci.

Background: Biallelic mutations in DNAJC12 were recently identified as a BH4-responsive cause of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). Outcome was only favorable when treatment was initiated early in life. We report on a 15-year-old boy with HPA due to a homozygous deletion in DNAJC12 in whom – despite his advanced age – treatment was initiated.
Case: A boy with developmental delay, an extrapyramidal movement disorder, and persistently elevated plasma phenylalanine levels was diagnosed with DNAJC12 deficiency at the age of 15 years. Diagnosis was made upon exome reanalysis revealing a homozygous 6.9 kb deletion in DNAJC12 which had not been detected by the standard exome analysis pipeline. Treatment with the BH4 analog sapropterin dihydrochloride (10 mg/kg/day) was initiated and evoked a 50% reduction of the plasma phenylalanine levels. More strikingly, a marked improvement in daily functioning and improved exercise tolerance was noted. Additionally, gait analysis before and after treatment initiation revealed a partial normalization of his movement disorder.
Conclusion: Patients with hyperphenylalaninemia due to DNAJC12 deficiency may benefit from treatment with a BH4 analog – even when introduced at a later age.Keywords: DNAJC12, Hyperphenylalaninemia, Sapropterin dihydrochloride, Tetrahydrobiopterin, Treatment",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6226397/,abstract

However, this process is complex and difficult to understand for patients and providers alike. With a recent push in the healthcare community to understand the patient experience and engage patients in their care, it is important to give patients the opportunity to learn about PM. We performed a systematic review to identify previous work assessing the quality of patient-facing PM materials from 2008 to July 2018. Ten studies were identified, which used varying methods and measures. A qualitative assessment was conducted to compare key elements of the studies, including study design, characteristics of the participant population, what measurements were used to assess the PM materials, understandability, preference, psychological reactions, and the type of PM materials being assessed. The studies identified provide important groundwork by highlighting consistent aspects of design that aid in comprehension. Eight of the ten studies focused on the content and organization of genomic test results, while the remaining two assessed educational tools. Two main design elements that appeared across the studies were appropriately designed visual aids and simplified language. The studies identified were limited by the participant populations that were used, which were primarily white and well educated. Only one study attempted to oversample patient populations typically underrepresented in this type of research.

The primary aim of weaning is to gradually replace natural protein from breast milk or standard infant formula with solids containing equivalent phenylalanine (Phe). In addition, a Phe-free second stage L-amino acid supplement is usually recommended from around 6 months to replace Phe-free infant formula. Our aim was to assess different weaning approaches used by health professionals across Europe.MethodsA cross sectional questionnaire (survey monkey®) composed of 31 multiple and single choice questions was sent to European colleagues caring for inherited metabolic disorders (IMD). Centres were grouped into geographical regions for analysis.ResultsWeaning started at 17–26 weeks in 85% (n = 81/95) of centres, >26 weeks in 12% (n = 11/95) and < 17 weeks in 3% (n = 3/95). Infant's showing an interest in solid foods, and their age, were important determinant factors influencing weaning commencement. 51% (n = 48/95) of centres introduced Phe containing foods at 17–26 weeks and 48% (n = 46/95) at >26 weeks. First solids were mainly low Phe vegetables (59%, n = 56/95) and fruit (34%, n = 32/95).A Phe exchange system to allocate dietary Phe was used by 52% (n = 49/95) of centres predominantly from Northern and Southern Europe and 48% (n = 46/95) calculated most Phe containing food sources (all centres in Eastern Europe and the majority from Germany and Austria). Some centres used a combination of both methods.A second stage Phe-free L-amino acid supplement containing a higher protein equivalent was introduced by 41% (n = 39/95) of centres at infant age 26–36 weeks (mainly from Germany, Austria, Northern and Eastern Europe) and 37% (n = 35/95) at infant age > 1y mainly from Southern Europe. 53% (n = 50/95) of centres recommended a second stage Phe-free L-amino acid supplement in a spoonable or semi-solid form.ConclusionsWeaning strategies vary throughout European PKU centres. There is evidence to suggest that different infant weaning strategies may influence longer term adherence to the PKU diet or acceptance of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements; rendering prospective long-term studies important. It is essential to identify an effective weaning strategy that reduces caregiver burden but is associated with acceptable dietary adherence and optimal infant feeding development.Keywords: Weaning, Infant, Phenylketonuria, Phenylalanine, Phe-free infant formula",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6349955/,abstract

Available crystal structures indicate a similarity in the architecture of several members of this protein family. Their molecular architecture makes these proteins vulnerable to mutation, when critical structural elements are affected. The latter preferentially involve the two transmembrane domain (TMD)/nucleotide‐binding domain (NBD) interfaces (transmission interfaces), formation of which requires engagement of coupling helices of intracellular loops with NBDs. Both, formation of the active sites and engagement of the coupling helices, are contingent on correct positioning of ICLs 2 and 4 and thus an important prerequisite for proper folding. Here, we show that active site compounds are capable of rescuing P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp) mutants ∆Y490 and ∆Y1133 in a concentration‐dependent manner. These trafficking deficient mutations are located at the transmission interface in pseudosymmetric position to each other. In addition, the ability of propafenone analogs to correct folding correlates with their ability to inhibit transport of model substrates. This finding indicates that folding correction and transport inhibition by propafenone analogs are brought about by binding to the active sites. Furthermore, this study demonstrates an asymmetry in folding correction with cis‐flupentixol, which reflects the asymmetric binding properties of this modulator to P‐gp. Our results suggest a mechanistic model for corrector action in a model ABC transporter based on insights into the molecular architecture of these transporters.Keywords: ABC transporter, folding correction, P‐glycoprotein, pharmacochaperone",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5464349/,abstract

Recently we showed that 2 h of LAN impaired glucose tolerance in rats. Several studies have suggested that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in communicating these acute effects of LAN to the periphery. Here, we investigated the acute effects of LAN on the liver transcriptome of male Wistar rats. Expression levels of individual genes were not markedly affected by LAN, nevertheless pathway analysis revealed clustered changes in a number of endocrine pathways. Subsequently, we used selective hepatic denervations [sympathetic (Sx), parasympathetic (Px), total (Tx, i.e., Sx plus Px), sham] to investigate the involvement of the ANS in the effects observed. Surgical removal of the sympathetic or parasympathetic hepatic branches of the ANS resulted in many, but small changes in the liver transcriptome, including a pathway involved with circadian clock regulation, but it clearly separated the four denervation groups. On the other hand, analysis of the liver metabolome was not able to separate the denervation groups, and only 6 out of 78 metabolites were significantly up- or downregulated after denervations. Finally, removal of the sympathetic and parasympathetic hepatic nerves combined with LAN exposure clearly modulated the effects of LAN on the liver transcriptome, but left most endocrine pathways unaffected.Conclusion: One-hour light-at-night acutely affects the liver transcriptome.

We linked our data to blood levels of T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) and κ-deleting recombination excision circles (KREC), determined as part of a neonatal screening program for immune-deficiencies, and representing quantities of newly formed T- and B-lymphocytes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for participants having TREC and KREC levels in the lowest quintile. Multivariate models were adjusted for postnatal age at blood sampling, and included perinatal (mode of delivery, infant sex, gestational age, and birth weight for gestational age), and maternal characteristics (age, parity, BMI, smoking, diabetes, and hypertensive disease).Low TREC was associated with cesarean section before labor (adjusted OR:1.32 [95% CI 1.08–1.62]), male infant sex (aOR:1.60 [1.41–1.83]), preterm birth at 35–36 weeks of gestation (aOR:1.89 [1.21–2.96]) and small for gestational age (aOR:1.67 [1.00–2.79]).

799,10.1186/s13039-019-0418-4,30766616,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundIn medical genetics, diseases are classified according to the nature (hypothetical nature) of the underlying genetic defect. The classification is “gene-centric” and “factor-centric”; a disease may be, thereby, designated as monogenic, oligogenic or polygenic/multifactorial. Chromosomal diseases/syndromes and abnormalities are generally considered apart from these designations due to distinctly different formation mechanisms and simultaneous encompassing from several to several hundreds of co-localized genes. These definitions are ubiquitously used and are perfectly suitable for human genetics issues in historical and academic perspective. However, recent achievements in systems biology have offered a possibility to explore the consequences of a genetic defect from genomic variations to molecular/cellular pathway alterations unique to a disease. Since pathogenetic mechanisms (pathways) are more influential on our understating of disease presentation and progression than genetic defects per se, a need for a disease classification reflecting both genetic causes and molecular/cellular mechanisms appears to exist. Here, we propose an extension to the common disease classification based on the underlying genetic defects, which focuses on disease-specific molecular pathways.ConclusionThe basic idea of our classification is to propose pathways as parameters for designating a genetic disease. To proceed, we have followed the tradition of using ancient Greek words and prefixes to create the terms for the pathway-based classification of genetic diseases. We have chosen the word “griphos” (γρῖφος), which simultaneously means “net” and “puzzle”, accurately symbolizing the term “pathway” currently used in molecular biology and medicine. Thus, diseases may be classified as monogryphic (single pathway is altered to result in a phenotype), digryphic (two pathways are altered to result in a phenotype), etc.; additionally, diseases may be designated as oligogryphic (several pathways are altered to result in a phenotype), polygryphic (numerous pathways or cascades of pathways are altered to result in a phenotype) and homeogryphic in cases of comorbid diseases resulted from shared pathway alterations. We suppose that classifying illness this way using both “gene-centric” and “pathway-centric” concepts is able to revolutionize current views on genetic diseases.Keywords: Chromosome, Disease, Genes, Classification, Genome, Pathway, Phenotype",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6362588/,abstract

VVC represents a major quality-of-life issue for women during their reproductive years, a stage of life where the vaginal epithelium is subject to periodic hormonally induced changes associated with menstruation and concomitant exposure to serum as well as potential intermittent contact with seminal fluid. Seminal fluid potently triggers Candida albicans to switch from yeastlike to filamentous modes of growth, a developmental response tightly linked to virulence. Conversely, vaginal fluid inhibits filamentation. Here, we used artificial formulations of seminal and vaginal fluids that faithfully mimic genuine fluids to assess the contribution of individual components within these fluids to filamentation. The high levels of albumin, amino acids, and N-acetylglucosamine in seminal fluid act synergistically as potent inducers of filamentous growth, even at atmospheric levels of CO2 and reduced temperatures (30°C). Using a simplified in vitro model that mimics the natural introduction of seminal fluid into the vulvovaginal environment, a pulse of artificial seminal fluid (ASF) was found to exert an enduring potential to overcome the inhibitory efficacy of artificial vaginal fluid (AVF) on filamentation.

Approximately 95% of all CAH cases are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency encoded by the CYP21A2 gene. The disorder is categorized into classical forms, including the salt-wasting and the simple virilizing types, and nonclassical forms based on the severity of the disease. The severity of the clinical features varies according to the level of residual 21-hydroxylase activity. Newborn screening for CAH is performed in many countries to prevent salt-wasting crises in the neonatal period, to prevent male sex assignment in affected females, and to reduce long-term morbidities, such as short stature, gender confusion, and psychosexual disturbances. 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is a marker for 21-hydroxylase deficiency and is measured using a radioimmunoassay, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or a fluoroimmunoassay. Recently, liquid chromatography linked with tandem mass spectrometry was developed for rapid, highly specific, and sensitive analysis of multiple analytes. Urinary steroid analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry also provides qualitative and quantitative data on the excretion of steroid hormone metabolites. Molecular analysis of CYP21A2 is useful for genetic counseling, confirming diagnosis, and predicting prognoses.

Stressful experiences increase the release of prefrontal amygdala neurotransmitters, a response that is relevant to cognitive, emotional, and behavioral coping. Moreover, exposure to stress elicits anxiety-like behavior and dendritic remodeling in the amygdala. Members of the miR-34 family have been suggested to regulate synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission processes, which mediate stress-related disorders. Using mice that harbored targeted deletions of all 3 members of the miR-34-family (miR-34-TKO), we evaluated acute stress-induced basolateral amygdala (BLA)-GABAergic and medial prefrontal cortex (mpFC) aminergic outflow by intracerebral in vivo microdialysis. Moreover, we also examined fear conditioning/extinction, stress-induced anxiety, and dendritic remodeling in the BLA of stress-exposed TKO mice.We found that TKO mice showed resilience to stress-induced anxiety and facilitation in fear extinction. Accordingly, no significant increase was evident in aminergic prefrontal or amygdala GABA release, and no significant acute stress-induced amygdalar dendritic remodeling was observed in TKO mice. Differential GRM7, 5-HT2C, and CRFR1 mRNA expression was noted in the mpFC and BLA between TKO and WT mice.

The objective of this study was to determine the appropriate dose of sapropterin in pediatric patients (0–6 years). The study design used D-optimization and was prospectively powered to achieve precise estimates of clearance and volume of distribution.MethodsOral sapropterin (5 or 20 mg/kg) was administered once daily.

We tested the technical reproducibility of this platform and applied it to the retrospective diagnosis of 190 individual plasma samples, 120 of which were collected from patients with a confirmed IEM. Our results demonstrate high intra-assay precision and linear detection for the majority compounds tested. Individual metabolomic profiles provided excellent sensitivity and specificity for the detection of a wide range of metabolic disorders and identified novel biomarkers for some diseases. With this platform, it is possible to use one test to screen for dozens of IEMs that might otherwise require ordering multiple unique biochemical tests. However, this test may yield false negative results for certain disorders that would be detected by a more well-established quantitative test and in its current state should be considered a supplementary test.

Personalized nutrition tailors dietary recommendations to specific biological requirements on the basis of a person’s health status and goals. The biology underpinning these recommendations is complex, and thus any recommendations must account for multiple biological processes and subprocesses occurring in various tissues and must be formed with an appreciation for how these processes interact with dietary nutrients and environmental factors. Therefore, a systems biology–based approach that considers the most relevant interacting biological mechanisms is necessary to formulate the best recommendations to help people meet their wellness goals. Here, the concept of “systems flexibility” is introduced to personalized nutrition biology. Systems flexibility allows the real-time evaluation of metabolism and other processes that maintain homeostasis following an environmental challenge, thereby enabling the formulation of personalized recommendations. Examples in the area of macro- and micronutrients are reviewed. Genetic variations and performance goals are integrated into this systems approach to provide a strategy for a balanced evaluation and an introduction to personalized nutrition.

In addition, this species is one of the few canids considered to be an obligate meat-eater, possessing a robust dentition for taking down large prey, and displays one of the most variable coat colorations amongst mammals. Here, we used comparative genomic analysis to investigate the evolutionary history and genetic basis for adaptations associated with cursoriality, hypercanivory, and coat color variation in African wild dogs. Genome-wide scans revealed unique amino acid deletions that suggest a mode of evolutionary digit loss through expanded apoptosis in the developing first digit. African wild dog-specific signals of positive selection also uncovered a putative mechanism of molar cusp modification through changes in genes associated with the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, required for spatial patterning of teeth, and three genes associated with pigmentation. Divergence time analyses suggest the suite of genomic changes we identified evolved ~1.7 Mya, coinciding with the diversification of large-bodied ungulates.

The aim of this study was to examine the polygenic overlap between ASD/ADHD and cognitive ability in individuals from the general population. Polygenic risk for ADHD and ASD was calculated from genome-wide association studies of ASD and ADHD conducted by the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium. Risk scores were created in three independent cohorts: Generation Scotland Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) (n=9863), the Lothian Birth Cohorts 1936 and 1921 (n=1522), and the Brisbane Adolescent Twin Sample (BATS) (n=921). We report that polygenic risk for ASD is positively correlated with general cognitive ability (beta=0.07, P=6 × 10−7, r2=0.003), logical memory and verbal intelligence in GS:SFHS. This was replicated in BATS as a positive association with full-scale intelligent quotient (IQ) (beta=0.07, P=0.03, r2=0.005). We did not find consistent evidence that polygenic risk for ADHD was associated with cognitive function; however, a negative correlation with IQ at age 11 years (beta=−0.08, Z=−3.3, P=0.001) was observed in the Lothian Birth Cohorts.

Spatial clustering of PKU cases was analysed using global and local spatial autocorrelation analysis in the geographic information system.ResultsThe database contained 4925 neonates with confirmed PKU during the study period, corresponding to an incidence of 6.28 (95% CI: 6.11 to 6.46) per 100 000 neonates screened. Incidence was highest in the provinces of Gansu, Ningxia and Qinghai, where it ranged from 19.00 to 28.63 per 100 000 neonates screened. Overall incidence was higher in the northern part of the country, where classical disease predominated, than in the southern part, where mild disease predominated. PKU cases clustered spatially (global Moran’s I=0.3603, Z=5.3097, p<0.001), and local spatial autocorrelation identified four northern provinces as high–high clusters (Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia and Shanxi).ConclusionsChina shows an intermediate PKU incidence among countries, and incidence differs substantially among Chinese provinces and between northern and southern regions.

Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of co-occurring NDDs that affect between 3% and 5% of the world population, thus presenting a great challenge to society. This problem calls for the need to understand the pathobiology of these disorders and to design new therapeutic strategies. One approach towards this has been the development of multiple analogous mouse models. This review discusses studies conducted in the mouse models of five major monogenic causes of ID and ASDs: Fmr1, Syngap1, Mecp2, Shank2/3 and Neuroligins/Neurnexins. These studies reveal that, despite having a diverse molecular origin, the effects of these mutations converge onto similar or related aetiological pathways, consequently giving rise to the typical phenotype of cognitive, social and emotional deficits that are characteristic of ID and ASDs. This convergence, therefore, highlights common pathological nodes that can be targeted for therapy.

Three databases were used to identify recent epidemiological studies (2003–2013) that examined exposure factors associated with general cognitive ability in children.

For each metabolic gene, a new computational approach can be developed for predicting a set of metabolites, whose concentration is predicted to change after gene knockout in urine, blood and other biological fluids. Both targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic approaches have been used to expand the range of disease-associate metabolites. The quantitative targeted approach, in conjunction with chemometrics, can be considered a basic tool for validating known diagnostic biomarkers in various metabolic disorders. The untargeted approach broadens the identification of new biomarkers in known IEMs and allows pathways analysis. Urine is an ideal biological fluid for metabolomics in neonatology; however, the lack of standardization of preanalytical phase may generate potential interferences in metabolomic studies.

Introduction: Most conventional drug delivery systems are not acceptable for pediatric patients as they differ in their developmental status and dosing requirements from other subsets of the population.

Areas covered: The current approaches and novel developments in the field of age-appropriate drug delivery for pediatric patients are critically discussed including patient-centric formulations, administration devices and packaging systems.
Expert opinion: Despite the incentives provided by recent regulatory modifications and the efforts of formulation scientists, there is still a need for implementation of pharmaceutical technologies that enable the manufacture of licensed age-appropriate formulations. Harmonization of endeavors from regulators, industry and academia by sharing learning associated with data obtained from pediatric investigation plans, product development pathways and scientific projects would be the way forward to speed up bench-to-market age appropriate formulation development.

This hypothesis is supported by observed long-term benefits associated with breastfeeding, such as better cognitive development in childhood, and lower risks of obesity and high blood pressure in later life. However, the possible underlying mechanisms are expected to be complex and may be difficult to disentangle due to the lack of understanding of the metabolic processes that differentiate breastfed infants compared to those receiving just formula feed.ObjectiveOur aim was to investigate the relationships between infant feeding and the lipid profiles and to validate specific lipids in separate datasets so that a small set of lipids can be used as nutritional biomarkers.MethodWe utilized a direct infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry method to analyse the lipid profiles of 3.2 mm dried blood spot samples collected at age 3 months from the Cambridge Baby Growth Study (CBGS-1), which formed the discovery cohort. For validation two sample sets were profiled: Cambridge Baby Growth Study (CBGS-2) and Pregnancy Outcome Prediction Study (POPS). Lipidomic profiles were compared between infant groups who were either exclusively breastfed, exclusively formula-fed or mixed-fed at various levels.

Selection of lipids was based on an iterative backward elimination procedure without compromising the class error in the classification mode.ConclusionFrom this study, we were able to identify and validate three lipids: PC(35:2), SM(36:2) and SM(39:1) that can be used collectively as biomarkers for infant nutrition during early development.

Quality nutrition during this brief window has been shown to have large and significant effects on health and development throughout childhood and even into adulthood. Despite the widespread understanding of this critical window, and the long-term consequences of leaving nutritional deficiencies unaddressed, little is known about the status of infant nutrition in rural China, or about the relationship between infant nutrition and cognitive development in rural China.Design, setting and participantsIn April 2013 and October 2013, we conducted a survey of 1808 infants aged 6–12 months living in 351 villages across 174 townships in nationally designated poverty counties in rural areas of southern Shaanxi Province, China.Main outcome measuresInfants were administered a finger prick blood test for haemoglobin and assessed according to the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. They were also measured for length and weight. Caregivers were administered a survey of demographic characteristics and feeding practices.ResultsWe found that 48.8% of sample infants were anaemic, 3.7% were stunted, 1.2% were underweight and 1.6% were wasted. Approximately 20.0% of the sample infants were significantly delayed in their cognitive development, while just over 32.3% of the sample infants were significantly delayed in their psychomotor development. After controlling for potential confounders, infants with lower haemoglobin counts were significantly more likely to be delayed in both their cognitive (p<0.01) and psychomotor development (p<0.01).ConclusionsThe anaemia rates that we identify in this study classify anaemia as a ‘severe’ public health problem according to the WHO. In contrast, there is virtually no linear growth failure among this population. We find that low haemoglobin levels among our sample population are associated with significant cognitive and psychomotor delays that could eventually affect children's schooling performance and labour force outcomes.Trial registration numberISRCTN44149146.Keywords: NUTRITION & DIETETICS, PUBLIC HEALTH",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4611485/,abstract

Haploinsufficiency of the RERE gene might contribute to different phenotypes seen in individuals with 1p36 deletions. We describe a neonate of an obese mother, diagnosed with type IV LTEC and type III esophageal atresia (EA), in which a 1p36 deletion including the RERE gene was detected. On the second day of life, a right thoracotomy and extrapleural esophagus atresia repair were attempted. One week later, a right cervical approach was performed to separate the cervical esophagus from the trachea. Three months later, a thoracic termino-terminal anastomosis of the esophagus was performed. An anterior fundoplication was required at 8 months of age due to severe gastroesophageal reflux and failure to thrive. A causal role of 1p36 deletions including the RERE gene in the malformation is proposed. Moreover, additional parental factors must be considered. Future studies are mandatory to elucidate genomic and epigenomic susceptibility factors that underlie these congenital malformations.

Recent policy recommendations and changes expand patient access to information about asymptomatic genetic conditions and create mechanisms for expanded insurance coverage for genetic tests. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends that laboratories provide incidental findings of medically actionable genetic variants after whole genome sequencing. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) established mechanisms to mandate coverage for genetic tests, such as BRCA. The ACA and ACMG, however, do not address insurance coverage for preventive interventions. These policies equate access to testing as access to prevention, without exploring the accessibility and affordability of interventions. In reality, insurance coverage for preventive interventions in asymptomatic adults is variable given the US health insurance system's focus on treatment. Health disparities will be exacerbated if only privileged segments of society can access preventive interventions, such as prophylactic surgeries, screenings, or medication. To ensure equitable access to interventions, federal or state legislatures should mandate insurance coverage for both predictive genetic testing and recommended follow-up interventions included in a list established by an expert panel or regulatory body.Keywords: ACA, ACMG, health disparity, insurance coverage, predictive genetic testing, prevention",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4555880/,abstract

838,10.1186/1471-2164-16-S8-S4,26110739,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundThere are now over 2000 loci in the human genome where genome wide association studies (GWAS) have found one or more SNPs to be associated with altered risk of a complex trait disease. At each of these loci, there must be some molecular level mechanism relevant to the disease. What are these mechanisms and how do they contribute to disease?ResultsHere we consider the roles of three primary mechanism classes: changes that directly alter protein function (missense SNPs), changes that alter transcript abundance as a consequence of variants close-by in sequence, and changes that affect splicing. Missense SNPs are divided into those predicted to have a high impact on in vivo protein function, and those with a low impact. Splicing is divided into SNPs with a direct impact on splice sites, and those with a predicted effect on auxiliary splicing signals. The analysis was based on associations found for seven complex trait diseases in the classic Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC1) GWA study and subsequent studies and meta-analyses, collected from the GWAS catalog. Linkage disequilibrium information was used to identify possible candidate SNPs for involvement in disease mechanism in each of the 356 loci associated with these seven diseases. With the parameters used, we find that 76% of loci have at least of these mechanisms. Overall, except for the low incidence of direct impact on splice sites, the mechanisms are found at similar frequencies, with changes in transcript abundance the most common. But the distribution of mechanisms over diseases varies markedly, as does the fraction of loci with assigned mechanisms. Many of the implicated proteins have previously been suggested as relevant, but the specific mechanism assignments are new. In addition, a number of new disease relevant proteins are proposed.ConclusionsThe high fraction of GWAS loci with proposed mechanisms suggests that these classes of mechanism play a major role. Other mechanism types, such as variants affecting expression of genes remote in the DNA sequence, will contribute in other loci. Each of the identified putative mechanisms provides a hypothesis for further investigation.Keywords: GWAS, SNPs, complex trait disease, missense, expression, splicing, functional annotation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480957/,abstract

Patients’ office visits with their PCPs were audio-recorded, and summative content analysis was used to describe how PCPs discussed genomic results.Key ResultsFor each genomic result discussed in 48 PCP–patient visits, we identified a “take-home” message (recommendation), categorized as continuing current management, further treatment, further evaluation, behavior change, remembering for future care, or sharing with family members. We analyzed how PCPs came to each recommendation by identifying 1) how they described the risk or importance of the given result and 2) the rationale they gave for translating that risk into a specific recommendation. Quantitative analysis showed that continuing current management was the most commonly coded recommendation across results overall (492/749, 66%) and for each individual result type except monogenic disease risk results. Pharmacogenetics was the most common result type to prompt a recommendation to remember for future care (94/119, 79%); carrier status was the most common type prompting a recommendation to share with family members (45/54, 83%); and polygenic results were the most common type prompting a behavior change recommendation (55/58, 95%). One-fifth of recommendation codes associated with monogenic results were for further evaluation (6/24, 25%). Rationales for these recommendations included patient context, family context, and scientific/clinical limitations of sequencing.ConclusionsPCPs distinguish substantive differences among categories of genome sequencing results and use clinical judgment to justify continuing current management in generally healthy patients with genomic results.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s11606-017-4295-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.KEY WORDS: genome sequencing, physician communication, medical decision-making",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5975138/,abstract

Despite the prenatal onset of the phenotype, most therapeutic trials have been conducted in adults. Here, we present evidence for fetal brain molecular and neonatal behavioral alterations in the Ts1Cje mouse model of Down syndrome. Embryonic day 15.5 brain hemisphere RNA from Ts1Cje embryos (n = 5) and wild type littermates (n = 5) was processed and hybridized to mouse gene 1.0 ST arrays. Bioinformatic analyses were implemented to identify differential gene and pathway regulation during Ts1Cje fetal brain development. In separate experiments, the Fox scale, ultrasonic vocalization and homing tests were used to investigate behavioral deficits in Ts1Cje pups (n = 29) versus WT littermates (n = 64) at postnatal days 3–21. Ts1Cje fetal brains displayed more differentially regulated genes (n = 71) than adult (n = 31) when compared to their age-matched euploid brains. Ts1Cje embryonic brains showed up-regulation of cell cycle markers and down-regulation of the solute-carrier amino acid transporters. Several cellular processes were dysregulated at both stages, including apoptosis, inflammation, Jak/Stat signaling, G-protein signaling, and oxidoreductase activity. In addition, early behavioral deficits in surface righting, cliff aversion, negative geotaxis, forelimb grasp, ultrasonic vocalization, and the homing tests were observed. The Ts1Cje mouse model exhibits abnormal gene expression during fetal brain development, and significant neonatal behavioral deficits in the pre-weaning period. In combination with human studies, this suggests that the Down syndrome phenotype manifests prenatally and provides a rationale for prenatal therapy to improve perinatal brain development and post-natal neurocognition.Keywords: Down syndrome, embryonic brain, systems biology, gene expression, neonatal behavior, genotype/phenotype correlation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4844354/,abstract

The inability to metabolize galactose results in galactosemia. Galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects newborns who are born asymptomatic, apparently well and healthy, then develop serious morbidity and mortality upon consuming milk that contains galactose. Those with galactosemia have a deficiency of an enzyme: classic galactosemia (type 1) results from severe deficiency of galactose-1-uridylyltransferase, while galactosemia type II results from galactokinase deficiency and type III results from galactose epimerase deficiency. Many countries include neonatal screening for galactosemia in their national newborn screening program; however, others do not, as the condition is rather rare, with an incidence of 1:30,000–1:100,000, and screening may be seen as not cost-effective and logistically demanding. Early detection and intervention by restricting galactose is not curative but is very rewarding, as it prevents deaths, mental retardation, liver cell failure, renal tubular acidosis and neurological sequelae, and may lead to resolution of cataract formation. Hence, national newborn screening for galactosemia prevents serious potential life-long suffering, morbidity and mortality.

Unfortunately, in a country where the burden of disease is high compared to other countries, only approximately 40% of children born in Jamaica currently benefit from NBS. As such, the future of NBS for SCD in Jamaica lies in island-wide screening.

Genome editing tools are necessary for the construction of strains for new applications and products, but can also play a crucial role in traditional ones, such as food and probiotics, as a research tool for gaining mechanistic insights and discovering new properties. Traditionally, recombinant DNA techniques for LAB have strongly focused on being food-grade, but they lack speed and the number of genetically tractable strains is still rather limited. Further tool development will enable rapid construction of multiple mutants or mutant libraries on a genomic level in a wide variety of LAB strains.

We report two siblings born 3 years apart with prenatal findings including facial dysmorphia, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, and premature delivery. They had severe lactic acidosis with onset within the first hours of life, had congenital dilated cardiomyopathy, and died at 16 h of life and 2 days of life, respectively.Biochemical evaluation of these patients showed elevated butyryl-carnitine in the blood and elevated methylmalonyl/succinyl-CoA and decreased hydroxybutyryl-CoA in frozen liver of patient 2, confirming abnormal short-chain fatty acid metabolism. Elevated butyryl-carnitine has been reported only in a single previous case of ECHS1 deficiency, which also had neonatal onset. Pyruvate and lactate levels were both elevated with a normal pyruvate-lactate ratio. This supports the previous hypothesis that lactic acidosis in these patients results from secondary inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The biomarker 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutyric acid was detected in patient 2, but at lower levels than in previously reported cases.These cases extend our understanding of the severe end of the phenotypic spectrum of ECHS1 deficiency, clarify the range of biochemical abnormalities associated with this new disorder, and highlight the need to suspect this disease in patients presenting with comparable metabolic derangements and dysmorphic features.Keywords: Enoyl-CoA hydratase, Lactic acidosis, Mitochondrial disease",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5110442/,abstract

Enzyme deficiency causes accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) and if left untreated will lead to profound and irreversible intellectual disability in most children. Traditionally, it has been managed with a low-Phe diet supplemented with a Phe-free protein substitute although newer treatment options mainly in combination with diet are available for some subgroups of patients with PKU, for example, sapropterin, large neutral amino acids, and glycomacropeptide. The diet consists of three parts: 1) severe restriction of dietary Phe; 2) replacement of non-Phe l-amino acids with a protein substitute commonly supplemented with essential fatty acids and other micronutrients; and 3) low-protein foods from fruits, some vegetables, sugars, fats and oil, and special low-protein foods (SLPF). The prescription of diet is challenging for health professionals. The high-carbohydrate diet supplied by a limited range of foods may program food preferences and contribute to obesity in later life. Abnormal tasting and satiety-promoting protein substitutes are administered to coincide with peak appetite times to ensure their consumption, but this practice may impede appetite for other important foods. Intermittent dosing of micronutrients when combined with l-amino acid supplements may lead to their poor bioavailability. Much work is required on the ideal nutritional profiling for special SLPF and Phe-free l-amino acid supplements.

In type II diabetes patients, amylin is abnormally increased, self-assembled into amyloid aggregates, and ultimately contributes to the apoptotic death of β-cells by mechanisms that are not completely understood. We have screened a library of approved drugs in order to identify inhibitors of amylin aggregation that could be used as tools to investigate the role of amylin aggregation in type II diabetes or as therapeutics in order to reduce β-cell damage. Interestingly, three of the compounds analyzed—benzbromarone, quercetin, and folic acid—are able to slow down amylin fiber formation according to Thioflavin T binding, turbidimetry, and Transmission Electron Microscopy assays. In addition to the in vitro assays, we have tested the effect of these compounds in an amyloid toxicity cell culture model and we have found that one of them, quercetin, has the ability to partly protect cultured pancreatic insulinoma cells from the cytotoxic effect of amylin. Our data suggests that quercetin can contribute to reduce oxidative damage in pancreatic insulinoma β cells by modulating the aggregation propensity of amylin.Keywords: quercetin, benzbromarone, folic acid, amylin, amyloid, aggregation, type II diabetes",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4926496/,abstract

White matter integrity was assessed using mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Eight lifetime indices of Phe control were computed to reflect average Phe (mean, index of dietary control), variability in Phe (standard deviation, standard error of estimate, % spikes), change in Phe with age (slope), and prolonged exposure to Phe (mean exposure, standard deviation exposure). Of these indices, mean Phe, mean exposure, and standard deviation exposure were the most powerful predictors of widespread microstructural white matter integrity compromise. Findings from the two previously unexamined exposure indices reflected the accumulative effects of elevations and variability in Phe.

Despite being an essentially linguistic function, its measurements are also used to evaluate executive aspects of verbal behavior. Performance in verbal fluency (VF) tasks varies according to age, education, and cognitive development. Neurodevelopmental disorders that affect the functioning of frontal areas tend to cause lower performance in VF tasks. Despite the relative consensus that has been reached in terms of the use of VF tasks for the diagnosis of dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, few studies have considered regional variations in Brazil. The present study sought to provide normative data on VF tasks in children by considering gender, age, education, and geopolitical region of origin with auxiliary purposes in neuropsychological diagnosis of disorders that occur with executive changes The study included 298 participants, 7–10 years of age of both genders, who performed three letter fluency tasks and three category fluency tasks. The data were subjected to correlational and variance analyses, with age and gender as factors. No effect of gender on the children's performance was found. However, significant differences between age groups were observed, with better performance in letter tasks in older children and better performance in letter tasks compared with category tasks. Significant regional differences in performance on the letter VF task were observed.

Synthetic BH4 is used medicinally for BH4-responsive phenylketonuria and inherited BH4 deficiency. BH4 supplementation has also drawn attention as a therapy for various NOS-related cardio-vascular diseases, but its use has met with limited success in decreasing BH2, the oxidized form of BH4. An increase in the BH2/BH4 ratio leads to NOS dysfunction. Previous studies revealed that BH4 supplementation caused a rapid urinary loss of BH4 accompanied by an increase in the blood BH2/BH4 ratio and an involvement of probenecid-sensitive but unknown transporters was strongly suggested in these processes. Here we show that OAT1 and OAT3 enabled cells to take up BP (BH4 and/or BH2) in a probenecid-sensitive manner using rat kidney slices and transporter-expressing cell systems, LLC-PK1 cells and Xenopus oocytes. Both OAT1 and OAT3 preferred BH2 and sepiapterin as their substrate roughly 5- to 10-fold more than BH4. Administration of probenecid acutely reduced the urinary exclusion of endogenous BP accompanied by a rise in blood BP in vivo. These results indicated that OAT1 and OAT3 played crucial roles: (1) in determining baseline levels of blood BP by excluding endogenous BP through the urine, (2) in the rapid distribution to organs of exogenous BH4 and the exclusion to urine of a BH4 excess, particularly when BH4 was administered, and (3) in scavenging blood BH2 by cellular uptake as the gateway to the salvage pathway of BH4, which reduces BH2 back to BH4.Keywords: Tetrahydrobiopterin, Dihydrobiopterin, Biopterin transport, NOS dysfunction, Organic anion transporter, Equilibrative nucleoside transporter",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5632347/,abstract

Part of the reason for this is difficulties in collecting, storing and shipping milk samples to the laboratory. Here we report the validation of a dried milk spot (DMS) system to measure FA composition to help overcome these obstacles.Milk FA were measured by gas chromatography and reported as percent of total FA; the FA of primary interest in this study were DHA and industrially produced trans FA (iTFA). Experiments were carried out using pooled milk samples from US (n = 5) and Malawian women (n = 50). Experiments compared liquid vs. DMS samples (n = 55), assessed stability of FA composition under different storage conditions (n = 5), and compared the results from two different labs using the same methods (n = 5).ResultsBoth % DHA and % iTFA levels in liquid and DMS samples were strongly correlated (R2 = 0.99 and 0.99, respectively, P < 0.0001). The % DHA in DMS samples was stable for up to four weeks at room temperature and up to three years at -80 °C; only slight deviations from the acceptable range of variability (±15 %) occurred in the 4 °C and -20 °C conditions for % DHA. The % iTFA was stable under all conditions.

Phylogenetic and sequence analyses confirmed that ApPAH is closely related to metazoan PAH, exhibiting the typical ACT regulatory and catalytic domains. Temporal expression patterns suggest that ApPAH has an important role in aphid developmental physiology, its mRNA levels peaking at the end of embryonic development. We used parental dsApPAH treatment to generate successful knockdown in aphid embryos and to study its developmental role. ApPAH inactivation shortens the adult aphid lifespan and considerably affects fecundity by diminishing the number of nymphs laid and impairing embryonic development, with newborn nymphs exhibiting severe morphological defects.

The recessive form presents with complex neurological and autonomic dysfunction whilst the dominant form presents as Dopa-responsive dystonia.Case presentationWe describe a South Asian child who initially presented with neurological dysfunction and recurrent vomiting and later developed recurrent hyperthermia for several months. The child did not have screening for hyperphenylalaninemia at birth and was found to have marked hyperphenylalaninemia after clinical presentation at 5 months. Further evaluation revealed BH4 deficiency. GTP-Cyclohydrolase I deficiency (GTPCH) was identified based on normal dihydro pteridine reductase activity and markedly reduced neopterin in dried blood spot test. After institution of treatment and control of high phenylalanine levels, clinical deterioration decelerated yet with noticeable residual neurological dysfunction.ConclusionTo authors’ knowledge, this is first report of GTPCH deficiency in a South Asian child.

The aim of the SPARK (Safety Paediatric efficAcy phaRmacokinetic with Kuvan®) trial was to assess the efficacy (improvement in daily phenylalanine tolerance, neuromotor development and growth parameters), safety and pharmacokinetics of sapropterin dihydrochloride in children <4 years.ResultsIn total, 109 male or female children <4 years with confirmed BH4-responsive phenylketonuria or mild hyperphenylalaninemia and good adherence to dietary treatment were screened. 56 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 10 mg/kg/day oral sapropterin plus a phenylalanine-restricted diet or to only a phenylalanine-restricted diet for 26 weeks (27 to the sapropterin and diet group and 29 to the diet-only group; intention-to-treat population). Of these, 52 patients with ≥1 pharmacokinetic sample were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis, and 54 patients were included in the safety analysis. At week 26 in the sapropterin plus diet group, mean phenylalanine tolerance was 30.5 (95% confidence interval 18.7–42.3) mg/kg/day higher than in the diet-only group (p < 0.001). The safety profile of sapropterin, measured monthly, was acceptable and consistent with that seen in studies of older children. Using non-linear mixed effect modelling, a one-compartment model with flip-flop pharmacokinetic behaviour, in which the effect of weight was substantial, best described the pharmacokinetic profile. Patients in both groups had normal neuromotor development and stable growth parameters.ConclusionsThe addition of sapropterin to a phenylalanine-restricted diet was well tolerated and led to a significant improvement in phenylalanine tolerance in children <4 years with BH4-responsive phenylketonuria or mild hyperphenylalaninemia.

Here, we describe the mutational and phenotypic spectrum of PAHD in a cohort of 420 patients from neonatal screening between 1999 and 2016. The observed phenotypes comprised 43.57% classic phenylketonuria, 33.10% mild PKU, and 23.33% mild hyperphenylalaninemia, with an overall PAHD incidence of 1 in 20,445. Genetic testing was performed for 209 patients and 72 variants including seven novel variants were identified. These included two synonymous and five pathogenic nonsynonymous variants (p.S36*, p.T186I, p.L255W, p.F302V and p.R413H). The most common variant among all patients was p.R243Q, followed by p.R241C, p.Y204C, p.R111* and c.442-1G > A. Variants p.R53H and p.F392I occurred only in MHP with 19.3% and 8.0% of the observed alleles respectively. The genotypes p.[R241C];[R243Q], p.[R243Q];[R243Q], and p.[Y204C];[R243Q] were abundant across all PAHD patients. The distributions of the null allele and the three defined genotypes, null/null, null/missense, and missense/missense, were significantly different between the cPKU and mPKU patients. However, no significant differences were found between mPKU and MHP patients, indicating that other modifier factors influence the phenotypic outcome in these patients. The data presented here will provide a valuable tool for improved genetic counseling and management of future cases of PAHD in China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6244417/,abstract

We performed electronic and manual literature searches in February 2016 for published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2016), MEDLINE (1950 to 2016), EMBASE (1980 to 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 2016). We did not impose language restrictions.Selection criteriaRCTs in which term or preterm neonates (postnatal age maximum of 28 days after reaching 40 weeks' postmenstrual age), or both, received sucrose for procedural pain. Control interventions included no treatment, water, glucose, breast milk, breastfeeding, local anaesthetic, pacifier, positioning/containing or acupuncture.Data collection and analysisOur main outcome measures were composite pain scores (including a combination of behavioural, physiological and contextual indicators). Secondary outcomes included separate physiological and behavioural pain indicators. We reported a mean difference (MD) or weighted MD (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed‐effect model for continuous outcome measures. For categorical data we used risk ratio (RR) and risk difference. We assessed heterogeneity by the I2 test. We assessed the risk of bias of included trials using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE system.Main resultsSeventy‐four studies enrolling 7049 infants were included. Results from only a few studies could be combined in meta‐analyses and for most analyses the GRADE assessments indicated low‐ or moderate‐quality evidence. There was high‐quality evidence for the beneficial effect of sucrose (24%) with non‐nutritive sucking (pacifier dipped in sucrose) or 0.5 mL of sucrose orally in preterm and term infants: Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) 30 s after heel lance WMD ‐1.70 (95% CI ‐2.13 to ‐1.26; I2 = 0% (no heterogeneity); 3 studies, n = 278); PIPP 60 s after heel lance WMD ‐2.14 (95% CI ‐3.34 to ‐0.94; I2 = 0% (no heterogeneity; 2 studies, n = 164). There was high‐quality evidence for the use of 2 mL 24% sucrose prior to venipuncture: PIPP during venipuncture WMD ‐2.79 (95% CI ‐3.76 to ‐1.83; I2 = 0% (no heterogeneity; 2 groups in 1 study, n = 213); and intramuscular injections: PIPP during intramuscular injection WMD ‐1.05 (95% CI ‐1.98 to ‐0.12; I2 = 0% (2 groups in 1 study, n = 232). Evidence from studies that could not be included in RevMan‐analyses supported these findings. Reported adverse effects were minor and similar in the sucrose and control groups. Sucrose is not effective in reducing pain from circumcision. The effectiveness of sucrose for reducing pain/stress from other interventions such as arterial puncture, subcutaneous injection, insertion of nasogastric or orogastric tubes, bladder catherization, eye examinations and echocardiography examinations are inconclusive. Most trials indicated some benefit of sucrose use but that the evidence for other painful procedures is of lower quality as it is based on few studies of small sample sizes. The effects of sucrose on long‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes are unknown.Authors' conclusionsSucrose is effective for reducing procedural pain from single events such as heel lance, venipuncture and intramuscular injection in both preterm and term infants. No serious side effects or harms have been documented with this intervention. We could not identify an optimal dose due to inconsistency in effective sucrose dosage among studies. Further investigation of repeated administration of sucrose in neonates is needed. There is some moderate‐quality evidence that sucrose in combination with other non‐pharmacological interventions such as non‐nutritive sucking is more effective than sucrose alone, but more research of this and sucrose in combination with pharmacological interventions is needed. Sucrose use in extremely preterm, unstable, ventilated (or a combination of these) neonates needs to be addressed. Additional research is needed to determine the minimally effective dose of sucrose during a single painful procedure and the effect of repeated sucrose administration on immediate (pain intensity) and long‐term (neurodevelopmental) outcomes.Keywords: Humans, Infant, Newborn, Administration, Oral, Analgesics, Analgesics/administration & dosage, Infant, Premature, Pain, Pain/physiopathology, Pain/prevention & control, Pain Measurement, Punctures, Punctures/adverse effects, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Sucrose, Sucrose/administration & dosage",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6457867/,abstract

Blood samples were collected on filter paper between 3 and 7 days after birth, and TSH level was measured by time-resolved fluorescence assay. Individuals with increased TSH (TSH ≥ 8 IU/L) levels detected by newborn screening were recalled for further evaluation. Serum TSH, FT3 and FT4 were determined by electrochemiluminescence assay using venous blood samples. Diagnosis of CH is based on elevated TSH levels (>10 IU/L) and decreased FT4 levels (<12 pmol/L). Patients with elevated TSH levels and normal FT4 levels were diagnosed as hyperthyrotropinemia. Permanent or transient CH was determined by using the results of thyroid function tests after temporary withdrawal of L-T4 therapy at approximately 2–3 years of age.ResultsAmong 1,238,340 infants in the newborn screening program, 14,443 individuals were recalled for reevaluation (re-call rate 1.18%), 911 and 731 individuals were subsequently determined to have hyperthyrotropinemia and CH respectively; thus, a prevalence of 1:1359 and 1:1694 for hyperthyrotropinemia and CH. Of the 731 patients with CH, 161 patients were diagnosed with permanent CH (PCH), and 159 patients were diagnosed with transient CH (TCH), the other 411 patients are too young to determine their subtypes. Patients with PCH required an increasing dose of L-T4 during the first few years, whereas patients with TCH required a decreased dose of L-T4. The TSH levels at diagnosis and the dose of L-T4 used were significantly higher in PCH cases than in transient cases. The FT4 levels at diagnosis were significantly lower in PCH cases than in TCH cases. The TSH levels at diagnosis, FT4 levels at diagnosis and L-T4 doses at 90 days were evaluated as predictors for differentiating PCH and TCH, and their accuracy at their respective optimal cutoffs were determined to be 60.6%, 66.7% and 93.9%, respectively.ConclusionsThe CH incidence in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is slightly higher (1:1694) compared to the worldwide levels (1/2000–1/4000). The PCH and TCH ratio is close to 1; thus, the estimated PCH incidence is 1/3388, which is similar to reported worldwide average incidence (1/3000). The L-T4 dose required at 90 days (>30 μg/day) has the highest predictive value for PCH. Earlier differentiation of PCH and TCH helps to determine appropriate treatment course.Keywords: congenital hypothyroidism, prevalence, predictor, L-T4 dose, Guangxi, China",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5704446/,abstract

883,10.5607/en.2016.25.1.1,26924928,"Go to:AbstractAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by a deficit in social behaviors and nonverbal interactions such as reduced eye contact, facial expression, and body gestures in the first 3 years of life. It is not a single disorder, and it is broadly considered to be a multi-factorial disorder resulting from genetic and non-genetic risk factors and their interaction. Genetic studies of ASD have identified mutations that interfere with typical neurodevelopment in utero through childhood. These complexes of genes have been involved in synaptogenesis and axon motility. Recent developments in neuroimaging studies have provided many important insights into the pathological changes that occur in the brain of patients with ASD in vivo. Especially, the role of amygdala, a major component of the limbic system and the affective loop of the cortico-striatothalamo-cortical circuit, in cognition and ASD has been proved in numerous neuropathological and neuroimaging studies. Besides the amygdala, the nucleus accumbens is also considered as the key structure which is related with the social reward response in ASD. Although educational and behavioral treatments have been the mainstay of the management of ASD, pharmacological and interventional treatments have also shown some benefit in subjects with ASD. Also, there have been reports about few patients who experienced improvement after deep brain stimulation, one of the interventional treatments. The key architecture of ASD development which could be a target for treatment is still an uncharted territory. Further work is needed to broaden the horizons on the understanding of ASD.Keywords: Autistic Disorders, Review, Neurobiology, Amygdala",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4766109/,abstract
884,10.1371/journal.pone.0163234,27695036,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundGlycomacropeptide (GMP) is a 64-amino acid glycophosphopeptide released from κ-casein during cheesemaking that promotes satiety, reduces body fat, increases bone mass and infers prebiotic and anti-inflammatory effects. The impact of adiposity and gender on bone health is unclear.ObjectiveTo determine how feeding female mice diets providing 60% Fat Kcal (high-fat) or 13% Fat Kcal (control) with either GMP or casein as the protein source impacts: body composition, ex vivo fatty acid oxidation, bone (femoral) biomechanical performance, and the relationship between body composition and bone.MethodsWeanling female C57Bl/6 mice were fed high-fat (60% Fat Kcal) or control diets (13% Fat Kcal) with GMP or casein from 3 to 32 weeks of age with assessment of body weight and food intake. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Fatty acid oxidation was measured in liver, muscle, and fat tissues using 14C-palmitate. Plasma concentrations of hormones and cytokines were determined. Bone biomechanical performance was assessed by the 3-point bending test.ResultsFemale mice fed high-fat diets showed increased fatty acid oxidation capacity in both gastrocnemius muscle and brown adipose tissue compared to mice fed the control diets with a lower fat content. Despite increased fat mass in mice fed the high-fat diets, there was little evidence of glucose impairment or inflammation. Mice fed the high-fat diets had significantly greater total body bone mineral density (BMD), femoral BMD, and femoral cross-sectional area than mice fed the control diets. Femora of mice fed the high-fat diets had increased yield load and maximum load before fracture, consistent with greater bone strength, but reduced post-yield displacement or ductility, consistent with bone brittleness. Female mice fed a high-fat GMP diet displayed increased fat oxidation capacity in subcutaneous fat relative to mice fed the high-fat casein diet. Regardless of dietary fat content, GMP increased total body bone mineral content and femur length. The prebiotic properties of GMP may mediate the beneficial effects of GMP on bone.ConclusionsFemale mice adapt to high-fat feeding by increasing oxidative capacity in muscle tissue and to a lesser extent brown adipose tissue. High-fat feeding in female mice leads to development of a bone phenotype where femora show increased BMD and are stronger, yet more brittle. The increased brittleness of bone was associated with increased body fat content due to high-fat feeding. In summary, high-fat feeding in female mice increases mineralization of bone, but negatively impacts bone quality resulting in brittle bones.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5047596/,abstract

The most severe forms of laminopathies feature, among other symptoms, congenital scoliosis, osteoporosis, osteolysis or delayed cranial ossification.Importantly, specific bone districts are typically affected in laminopathies. Spine is severely affected in LMNA-linked congenital muscular dystrophy. Mandible, terminal phalanges and clavicles undergo osteolytic processes in progeroid laminopathies and Restrictive Dermopathy, a lethal developmental laminopathy. This specificity suggests that lamin A/C regulates fine mechanisms of bone turnover, as supported by data showing that lamin A/C mutations activate non-canonical pathways of osteoclastogenesis, as the one dependent on TGF beta 2.Here, we review current knowledge on laminopathies affecting bone and LMNA involvement in bone turnover and highlight lamin-dependent mechanisms causing bone disorders.

888,10.1161/JAHA.118.009624,30608180,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundTetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), which is critical to embryonic heart development. We aimed to study the effects of sapropterin (Kuvan), an orally active synthetic form of tetrahydrobiopterin on eNOS uncoupling and congenital heart defects (CHDs) induced by pregestational diabetes mellitus in mice.Methods and ResultsAdult female mice were induced to pregestational diabetes mellitus by streptozotocin and bred with normal male mice to produce offspring. Pregnant mice were treated with sapropterin or vehicle during gestation. CHDs were identified by histological analysis. Cell proliferation, eNOS dimerization, and reactive oxygen species production were assessed in the fetal heart. Pregestational diabetes mellitus results in a spectrum of CHDs in their offspring. Oral treatment with sapropterin in the diabetic dams significantly decreased the incidence of CHDs from 59% to 27%, and major abnormalities, such as atrioventricular septal defect and double‐outlet right ventricle, were absent in the sapropterin‐treated group. Lineage tracing reveals that pregestational diabetes mellitus results in decreased commitment of second heart field progenitors to the outflow tract, endocardial cushions, and ventricular myocardium of the fetal heart. Notably, decreased cell proliferation and cardiac transcription factor expression induced by maternal diabetes mellitus were normalized with sapropterin treatment. Furthermore, sapropterin administration in the diabetic dams increased eNOS dimerization and lowered reactive oxygen species levels in the fetal heart.ConclusionsSapropterin treatment in the diabetic mothers improves eNOS coupling, increases cell proliferation, and prevents the development of CHDs in the offspring. Thus, sapropterin may have therapeutic potential in preventing CHDs in pregestational diabetes mellitus.Keywords: animal model cardiovascular disease, cardiac embryology, congenital cardiac defect, diabetes mellitusSubject Categories: Animal Models of Human Disease, Basic Science Research, Congenital Heart Disease, Pharmacology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6404194/,abstract

To achieve this goal, we propose a metacognitive approach that integrates basic science with the humanistic and health system aspects of medical education.Intervention:During the week, via problem-based learning and lectures, first-year medical students were taught the basic science underlying a disease. Each Friday, a patient with the disease spoke to the class. Students then wrote illness scripts, which required them to metacognitively reflect not only on disease pathophysiology, complications, and treatments but also on the humanistic and health system issues revealed during the patient encounter. Evaluation of the intervention was conducted by measuring results on course exams and national board exams and analyzing free responses on the illness scripts and student course feedback. The course exams and National Board of Medical Examiners questions were divided into 3 categories: content covered in lecture, problem-based learning, or patient + illness script. Comparisons were made using Student t-test. Free responses were inductively analyzed using grounded theory methodology.Context:This curricular intervention was implemented during the first 13-week basic science course of medical school. The main objective of the course, Scientific Principles of Medicine, is to lay the scientific foundation for subsequent organ system courses. A total of 150 students were enrolled each year. We evaluated this intervention over 2 years, totaling 300 students.Outcome:Students scored significantly higher on illness script content compared to lecture content on the course exams (mean difference = 11.1, P = .006) and national board exams given in December (mean difference = 21.8, P = .0002) and June (mean difference = 12.7, P = .016).

This study describes the epidemiology of transition in a population of RD patients, using data from the Veneto Region Rare Diseases Registry (VRRDR), a web-based registry monitoring since 2002 a consistent number of RD in a defined area (4.9 million inhabitants). Methods: Longitudinal cohorts of patients born in the years 1988 to 1998 and enrolled in the VRRDR in their paediatric age were identified. Data referred to this group of patients, experiencing transition from paediatric to adult age during the years 2006–2016, are presented. Results: 2153 RD patients (44.1% females and 55.9% males) passed from childhood to adulthood in the study period, corresponding to a 3-fold increase from 2006 to 2016. The majority of these patients was affected by congenital anomalies (32.0%), by hematologic diseases (15.9%), eye disorders (12.1%) and neoplasms (7.9%). RD patients who experienced transition from paediatric age to adulthood represent the 9.2% of adult patients enrolled in the Registry at 31 December 2016. Conclusions: We described a subset of RD young adults experiencing transition into adulthood. The data reported can be considered as minimum values for estimating the size of this increasing population presenting specific transition needs. These figures are valuable for clinicians, patients and health planners.

However, much current clinical research and practice falls short of this objective by selecting outcome measures which do not capture patient value to the fullest. In this Opinion, we discuss Patient-Centered Outcomes Measures (PCOMs), which have the potential to systematically incorporate patient perspectives to measure those outcomes that matter most to patients. We argue for greater multi-stakeholder collaboration to develop PCOMs, with rare disease patients and families at the center. Beyond advancing the science of patient input, PCOMs are powerful tools to translate care or observed treatment benefit into an ‘interpretable’ measure of patient benefit, and thereby help demonstrate clinical effectiveness. We propose mixed methods psychometric research as the best route to deliver fit-for-purpose PCOMs in rare diseases, as this methodology brings together qualitative and quantitative research methods in tandem with the explicit aim to efficiently utilise data from small samples. And, whether one opts to develop a brand-new PCOM or to select or adapt an existing outcome measure for use in a rare disease, the anchors remain the same: patients, their daily experience of the rare disease, their preferences, core concepts and values. Ultimately, existing value frameworks, registries, and outcomes-based contracts largely fall short of consistently measuring the full range of outcomes that matter to patients. We argue that greater use of PCOMs in rare diseases would enable a fast track to Patient-Centered Care.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13023-017-0718-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Patient-centered outcome measures, Rare diseases, Patient-focused drug development (PFDD), Clinical outcome assessments, Patient-reported outcomes, Patient-relevant outcomes, Mixed methods research, Patient centricity, Rasch measurement theory",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5667521/,abstract

A significant proportion is amenable to treatment either directly targeting the underlying pathophysiology (often with improvement of symptoms) or with the potential to halt disease progression and prevent/minimize further damage.MethodsWe performed a systematic literature review to identify all reports of IEMs presenting with CP-like symptoms before 5 years of age, and selected those for which evidence for effective treatment exists.ResultsWe identified 54 treatable IEMs reported to mimic CP, belonging to 13 different biochemical categories. A further 13 treatable IEMs were included, which can present with CP-like symptoms according to expert opinion, but for which no reports in the literature were identified. For 26 of these IEMs, a treatment is available that targets the primary underlying pathophysiology (e.g. neurotransmitter supplements), and for the remainder (n = 41) treatment exerts stabilizing/preventative effects (e.g. emergency regimen). The total number of treatments is 50, and evidence varies for the various treatments from Level 1b, c (n = 2); Level 2a, b, c (n = 16); Level 4 (n = 35); to Level 4–5 (n = 6); Level 5 (n = 8). Thirty-eight (57%) of the treatable IEMs mimicking CP can be identified by ready available metabolic screening tests in blood or urine, while the remaining IEMs require more specific and sometimes invasive tests.ConclusionsLimited by the rare nature of IEMs and incomplete information in the literature, we conclude that (1) A surprisingly large number of IEMs can present with CP symptoms, as ‘CP mimics’, (2) although individually rare, a large proportion of these diseases are treatable such that neurological damage can either be reversed or prevented, (3) clinician awareness of treatable CP mimics is important for appropriate screening, diagnosis, and early intervention, and (4) systematic studies are required to elucidate the collective frequency of treatable IEMs in CP.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13023-014-0197-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Inherited metabolic diseases, Therapy, Diagnosis, Atypical cerebral palsy, Movement disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4273454/,abstract

High levels of Methymalonic Acid (MMA) and Homocysteine (HC) have been identified as better indicators of B-12 deficiency than the actual serum B-12 level itself. We evaluated the prevalence of vitamin B-12 deficiency using appropriate cut-off levels of vitamin B-12, MMA and HC, and determined the relationship between serum levels of vitamin B-12, MMA and HC in cancer.MethodsThis is a cross-sectional study using a consecutive case series of 316 cancer patients first seen at Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA) at Midwestern Regional Medical Center between April 2014 and June 2014. All patients were evaluated at baseline for vitamin B-12 (pg/mL), MMA (nmol/L) and HC (μmol/L) levels. In accordance with previously published research, the following cut-offs were used to define vitamin B-12 deficiency: <300 pg/mL for vitamin B-12, >260 nmol/L for MMA and >12 μmol/L for HC. The relationship between B-12, MMA and HC was evaluated using Spearman's rho correlation coefficient and cross-tabulation analysis. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were estimated using the non-parametric method to further evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of vitamin B-12 using Fedosov quotient as the ""gold standard"".ResultsMean age at presentation was 52.5 years. 134 (42.4%) patients were males while 182 (57.6%) were females. Median vitamin B-12, MMA and HC levels were 582.5 pg/mL, 146.5 nmol/L and 8.4 μmol/L respectively. Of 316 patients, 28 (8.9%) were vitamin B-12 deficient based on vitamin B-12 (<300pg/mL), 34 (10.8%) were deficient based on MMA (>260 nmol/L) while 55 (17.4%) were deficient based on HC (>12 μmol/L). Correlation analysis revealed a significant weak negative correlation between vitamin B-12 and MMA (rho = -0.22) as well as B-12 and HC (rho = -0.35). ROC curves suggested MMA to have the best discriminatory power in predicting B-12 deficiency.ConclusionVitamin B-12 is poorly correlated with MMA and HC in cancer. Using serum vitamin B-12 alone to evaluate B-12 status in cancer may fail to identify those with functional deficiency. A thorough clinical assessment is important to identify patients that may have risk factors and/or symptoms suggestive of deficiency. These patients should have additional testing of MMA and HC regardless of their B-12 levels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4725715/,abstract

However, these processes can be compromised by neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterized by the presence of social and communicative deficits, and restricted interests/repetitive behaviors. Although prior investigations have attempted to elucidate the nature of cognitive control deficits in ASD, whether there is an underlying information processing deficit associated with cognitive control remains unclear. The present study challenged cognitive control in 15 high-functioning adults with ASD and 15 typically developing (TD) controls using three novel tasks designed to systematically manipulate uncertainty. We aimed to investigate the efficiency of cognitive control in sequential information processing, cognitive control of non-sequential information processing across a range of cognitive load, and cognitive control capacity under time constraints. Results demonstrated that the ASD group performed less efficiently under sequential and non-sequential information processing, and had reduced cognitive control capacity under time constraints relative to the TD group.

In this paper, we first discuss the research on the strength of the link between early-life health and adult outcomes, and then provide an evidence-based review of the effectiveness of existing U.S. policies targeting the early-life environment. We conclude that there is a robust and economically meaningful relationship between early-life conditions and well-being throughout the lifecycle, as measured by adult health, educational attainment, labor market attachment, and other indicators of socio-economic status. However, there is some variation in the degree to which current policies in the U.S. are effective in improving early-life conditions.

Based on HPLC analysis, the underlying mechanism for this uncoupling is a reduced tetrahydrobiopterin: dihydrobiopterin ratio (BH4:BH2) found in breast, colorectal, epidermoid and head and neck tumors compared to normal tissues. Increasing BH4:BH2 and reconstitution of coupled NOS activity in breast cancer cells with the BH4 salvage pathway precursor, sepiapterin, causes significant shifts in downstream signaling including increased cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activity, decreased β-catenin expression and TCF4 promoter activity, and reduced NF-κB promoter activity. Sepiapterin inhibited breast tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo as measured by clonogenic assay, Ki67 staining and 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). In summary, using diverse tumor types, it is demonstrated that the BH4:BH2 ratio is lower in tumor tissues and as a consequence nitric oxide synthase activity generates more peroxynitrite and superoxide anion than nitric oxide resulting in important tumor growth promoting and anti-apoptotic signaling properties.ImplicationsThe synthetic BH4, Kuvan®, is used to elevate BH4:BH2 in some phenylketonuria patients and to treat diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction suggesting a novel, testable approach for correcting an abnormality of tumor metabolism to control tumor growth.Keywords: Nitric Oxide, tetrahydrobiopterin, sepiapterin, cGMP, breast cancer",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4470720/,abstract

Recently developed new techniques, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9), significantly facilitate the progression in this field. However, mutations associated with the double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) introduced by these systems hampered their direct usage in clinic. In order to prevent the mutations caused by DSBs, we have designed a novel mean to induce homology-directed recombination (HDR) without DSBs, i.e., the fusion protein of RecA with cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). The involvement of RecA in these fusion proteins will play important roles in formation of the nucleoprotein filament with single strand DNA (ssDNA) in vitro and promoting HDR in vivo; whereas the involvement of CPP in these fusion proteins will mainly play a role in facilitating cellular intake/uptake of the nucleoprotein filaments. Our results indicated that certain amount of the fusion proteins expressed in bacteria is in soluble fraction, whereas majority of the fusion proteins expressed in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells is in soluble fraction. Interestingly, expression of these fusion proteins in bacteria completely blocked cell growth, whereas expression of them in BHK cells significantly inhibited cell growth, implying that these fusion proteins may bind to ssDNA regions, such as ssDNA regions in DNA replication forks, and inhibit cell growth.

All subjects were interviewed face-to-face to fill in a questionnaire that covered 36 CHD-related variables. The 358 subjects were randomly divided into a training set and a testing set at the ratio of 85:15. The training set was used to identify the significant predictors of CHD by univariate logistic regression analyses and develop a standard feed-forward back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model for the prediction of CHD. The testing set was used to test and evaluate the performance of the ANN model. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed on SPSS 18.0. The ANN models were developed on Matlab 7.1.The univariate logistic regression identified 15 predictors that were significantly associated with CHD, including education level (odds ratio  = 0.55), gravidity (1.95), parity (2.01), history of abnormal reproduction (2.49), family history of CHD (5.23), maternal chronic disease (4.19), maternal upper respiratory tract infection (2.08), environmental pollution around maternal dwelling place (3.63), maternal exposure to occupational hazards (3.53), maternal mental stress (2.48), paternal chronic disease (4.87), paternal exposure to occupational hazards (2.51), intake of vegetable/fruit (0.45), intake of fish/shrimp/meat/egg (0.59), and intake of milk/soymilk (0.55). After many trials, we selected a 3-layer BPNN model with 15, 12, and 1 neuron in the input, hidden, and output layers, respectively, as the best prediction model. The prediction model has accuracies of 0.91 and 0.86 on the training and testing sets, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and Yuden Index on the testing set (training set) are 0.78 (0.83), 0.90 (0.95), and 0.68 (0.78), respectively. The areas under the receiver operating curve on the testing and training sets are 0.87 and 0.97, respectively.This study suggests that the BPNN model could be used to predict the risk of CHD in individuals.

Yet, many patients still fail to be systematically investigated.MethodsTo improve access to services, an ambulatory team has been established since 1998, delivering on-site clinical genetics consultations and gradually upgrading services to 502 children and young adults with ASD in their standard environment across 26 day-care hospitals and specialized institutions within the Greater Paris region. The evaluation included a clinical genetics consultation, screening for fragile X syndrome, metabolic workup, chromosomal microarray analysis, and, in a proportion of patients, next-generation sequencing of genes reported in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.ResultsFragile X syndrome and pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) accounted for the disease in 10% of cases, including 4/312 (1.3%) with fragile X syndrome and 34/388 (8.8%) with pathogenic CNVs (19 de novo and 4 inherited). Importantly, adding high-throughput resequencing of reported intellectual disability/ASD genes to the screening procedure had a major impact on diagnostic yield in the 141 patients examined most recently. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic sequence variants in 27 disease genes were identified in 33/141 patients (23.4%; 23 were de novo and 10 inherited, including five X-linked and five recessive compound heterozygous variants). Diagnosed cases presented atypical and/or syndromic ASD with moderate to severe intellectual disability. The diagnostic yield of fragile X syndrome and array CGH testing combined with next-generation sequencing was significantly higher than fragile X syndrome and array CGH alone (p value 0.009). No inborn errors of metabolism were detected with the metabolic screening.ConclusionBased on the diagnostic rate observed in this cohort, we suggest that a stepwise procedure be considered, first screening pathogenic CNVs and a limited number of disease genes in a much larger number of patients, especially those with syndromic ASD and intellectual disability.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13229-019-0284-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Autism spectrum disorder, Gene panel, Next-generation sequencing, Microarray, Copy number variant, Sequence variant, Fragile X syndrome, Genetic counseling, Genetic diagnosis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6686526/,abstract

A global, untargeted identification of the metabolic fingerprint may help elucidate the etiology of sIUGR. Umbilical cord blood and placentas collected from 15 pairs of sIUGR monochorionic twins, 24 pairs of uncomplicated twins, and 14 singletons diagnosed with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolomic analyses. Supervised multivariate regression analysis and pathway analysis were performed to compare control twins with sIUGR twins. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was utilized to explore metabolic differences within sIUGR co-twins. Linear logistic regression was applied to screen metabolites that significantly differed in concentration between control twins and sIUGR twins or IUGR singletons. Umbilical cord blood demonstrated better global metabolomic separation of sIUGR and control twins compared to the placenta. Disrupted amino acid and fatty acid metabolism as well as high levels of exposure to environmental xenobiotics were associated with sIUGR. The metabolic abnormalities in MCDA twins suggested that in utero growth discordance is caused by intrauterine and extrauterine environmental factors, rather than genetics.

The present study demonstrated that proteins were easily extracted from dried NAF spots on Guthrie cards and were suitable for mass spectrometry analysis. NAF was obtained from 80 women, collected on Guthrie cards, between 2007 and 2010. The NAF-proteins were extracted from the card by incubating the card in water. These proteins were then quantified and separated using one-dimensional, 12% SDS-PAGE, gel electrophoresis and on high-resolution gradient gels at different concentrations (4–12, 8–16 and 4–20%). The bands with the most abundant proteins were excised from the gradient gels and the proteins were identified by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight. Immunoglobulins, Zn-α2-glicoprotein, apoliprotein D and prolactin inducible protein were among those identified. The NAF-Guthrie card collection method has not been applied previously, however, NAF proteins have been identified using other collecting techniques, confirming the feasibility of the NAF Guthrie card collection method for analyzing the proteins within NAF. The NAF-Guthrie card collecting method has multiple advantages, including being inexpensive, non-invasive, reliable and painless, and the cards can be stored at room temperature. Examining NAF may assist in identifying individuals at a higher risk of breast cancer and in improving patient prognosis.Keywords: nipple aspirate fluid, breast neoplasms, proteome, mass spectrometry, Guthrie card",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4438942/,abstract

Simultaneously, we used RFLP to detect the c.1331+2T>C mutation in 85 Hungarian deaf Roma patients, control groups of 702 normal hearing Romanies from both countries and 375 hearing impaired Slovak Caucasians. We analyzed the haplotype using 21 SNPs spanning a 5.34Mb around the mutation c.1331+2T>C.ResultsOne pathogenic mutation (c.1331+2T>C) was identified in 12 homozygous hearing impaired Roma patients.

In a first series of experiment, the frontoparietal electrocorticogram was recorded 15 min before and 60 min after injection. In a second series of experiments, the whole brain of each animal was rapidly removed at 40 min post-injection, and different regions were separated: amygdala, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain and ventral striatum on ice followed by DNA microarray (4 × 44 K whole rat genome chip) analysis.RESULTS: Spectral analysis revealed that a single systemic injection of MK-801 significantly and selectively augmented the power of baseline gamma frequency (30-80 Hz) oscillations in the frontoparietal electroencephalogram. DNA microarray analysis showed the largest number (up- and down- regulations) of gene expressions in the cerebral cortex (378), midbrain (376), hippocampus (375), ventral striatum (353), amygdala (301), and hypothalamus (201) under low-dose (0.08 mg/kg) of MK-801.

Similarly, male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to social defeat in mid-adolescence (P35-39) show impaired working memory in adulthood (P56-70), along with decreased medial PFC (mPFC) dopamine activity that results in part from increased dopamine transporter-mediated clearance. Here, we determined if dopamine synthesis and D2 autoreceptor-mediated inhibition of dopamine release in the adult mPFC are also enhanced by adolescent defeat to contribute to later dopamine hypofunction. Control and previously defeated rats did not differ in either DOPA accumulation following amino acid decarboxylase inhibition (NSD-1015 100 mg/kg ip.) or total/phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase protein expression, suggesting dopamine synthesis in the adult mPFC is not altered by adolescent defeat. However, exposure to adolescent defeat caused greater decreases in extracellular dopamine release (measured using in vivo chronoamperometry) in the adult mPFC upon local infusion of the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole (3 nM), implying greater D2 autoreceptor function. Equally enhanced D2 autoreceptor-mediated inhibition of dopamine release is seen in the adolescent (P40 or P49) mPFC, which declines in control rats by adulthood. However, this developmental decrease in autoreceptor function is absent following adolescent defeat, suggesting retention of an adolescent-like phenotype into adulthood. Current and previous findings indicate adolescent defeat decreases extracellular dopamine availability in the adult mPFC via both enhanced inhibition of dopamine release and increased dopamine clearance, which may be viable targets for improving treatment of cognitive deficits seen in neuropsychiatric disorders promoted by adolescent stress.Keywords: Bullying, Social defeat, Tyrosine hydroxylase, Dopamine transporter",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6105450/,abstract

We provide a conceptual discussion of these issues and follow with a concrete demonstration of our proposed solution. Using two different disorders – depression and substance use – as examples, we illustrate how we can evaluate competing theories regarding their etiology by integrating information from various domains including latent variable models, neurobiology, and quasi-experimental data such as twin and adoption studies, rather than relying on any single methodology alone. More broadly, we discuss the extent to which such integrative thinking allows for inferences about the etiology of mental disorders, rather than focusing on descriptive correlates alone.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of BBR on HNF1α-mediated PCSK9 transcription. Administration of BBR to hyperlipidemic mice and hamsters lowered circulating PCSK9 concentrations and hepatic PCSK9 mRNA levels without affecting the gene expression of HNF1α. However, hepatic HNF1α protein levels were markedly reduced in BBR-treated animals as compared with the control. Using HepG2 cells as a model system, we obtained evidence that BBR treatment let to accelerated degradation of HNF1α protein. By applying inhibitors to selectively block the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosomal pathway, we show that HNF1α protein content in HepG2 cells was not affected by bafilomycin A1 treatment, but it was dose-dependently increased by UPS inhibitors bortezomib and MG132. Bortezomib treatment elevated HNF1α and PCSK9 cellular levels with concomitant reductions of LDL receptor protein. Moreover, HNF1α protein displayed a multiubiquitination ladder pattern in cells treated with BBR or overexpressing ubiquitin. By expressing GFP-HNF1α fusion protein in cells, we observed that blocking UPS resulted in accumulation of GFP-HNF1α in cytoplasm. Importantly, we show that the BBR reducing effects on HNF1α protein and PCSK9 gene transcription can be eradicated by proteasome inhibitors. Altogether, our studies using BBR as a probe uncovered a new aspect of PCSK9 regulation by ubiquitin-induced proteasomal degradation of HNF1α.Keywords: Dyslipidemia, Lipid Metabolism, Nuclear Receptor, Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9), Proteasome, Ubiquitylation (Ubiquitination), HNF1a, LDL Receptor",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4326815/,abstract

Current research regarding the serotonin system revolves around its dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders, but there is no database collating genetic mutations that result in serotonin abnormalities. To bridge this gap, we developed a list of genes in mice that, when perturbed, result in altered levels of serotonin either in brain or blood. Due to the intrinsic limitations of search, the current list should be considered a preliminary subset of all relevant cases. Nevertheless, it offered an opportunity to gain insight into what types of genes have the potential to impact serotonin by using gene ontology (GO). This analysis found that genes associated with monoamine metabolism were more often associated with increases in brain serotonin than decreases. Speculatively this could be because several pathways (and therefore many genes) are responsible for the clearance and metabolism of serotonin whereas only one pathway (and therefore fewer genes) is directly involved in the synthesis of serotonin. Another contributor could be cross talk between monoamine systems such as dopamine. In contrast, genes that were associated with decreases in brain serotonin were more likely linked to a developmental process. Sensitivity of serotonin neurons to developmental perturbations could due to their complicated neuroanatomy or possibly they may be negatively regulated by dysfunction of their innervation targets. Thus these observations suggest hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying the vulnerability of brain serotonin neurotransmission.Keywords: serotonin, neurodegenerative disease, gene ontology, raphe, dopamine, monoamine, platelet",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493142/,abstract

Here, we review the principles and methodology behind untargeted metabolomics, recent pilot studies utilizing this technology, and areas in which it may be integrated into the care of children with this disorder in the future.Keywords: autism, untargeted metabolomics, inborn errors of metabolism, metabolome, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6746843/,abstract

MAT1A encodes the subunit that forms two methionine adenosyltransferase isoenzymes, tetrameric MAT I and dimeric MAT III, that catalyze the conversion of methionine and ATP to S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). Subnormal MAT I/III activity leads to hypermethioninemia. Individuals, with hypermethioninemia due to one of the MAT1A mutations that in heterozygotes cause relatively mild and clinically benign hypermethioninemia are currently often being flagged in screening programs measuring methionine elevation to identify newborns with defective cystathionine β-synthase activity. Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for MAT1A mutations are less frequent. Some but not all, such individuals have manifested demyelination or other CNS abnormalities.Purpose of the studyThe goals of the present effort have been to determine the frequency of such abnormalities, to find how best to predict whether they will occur, and to evaluate the outcomes of the variety of treatment regimens that have been used. Data have been gathered for 64 patients, of whom 32 have some evidence of CNS abnormalities (based mainly on MRI findings), and 32 do not have such evidence.Results and DiscussionThe results show that mean plasma methionine concentrations provide the best indication of the group into which a given patient will fall: those with means of 800 μM or higher usually have evidence of CNS abnormalities, whereas those with lower means usually do not. Data are reported for individual patients for MAT1A genotypes, plasma methionine, total homocysteine (tHcy), and AdoMet concentrations, liver function studies, results of 15 pregnancies, and the outcomes of dietary methionine restriction and/or AdoMet supplementation. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms that might contribute to CNS damage are discussed, and tentative suggestions are put forth as to optimal management.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545930/,abstract

Neonatal screening for CAH is effective in detecting the salt-wasting (SW) form and in reducing mortality. In this study, our aim was to estimate the incidence of CAH in Turkey and to assess the characteristics and efficacy of the adopted newborn CAH screening strategy.Methods:A pilot newborn CAH screening study was carried out under the authority of the Turkish Directorate of Public Health. Newborn babies of ≥32 gestational weeks and ≥1500 gr birth weight from four cities, born between March 27-September 15, 2017 were included in the study. Screening protocol included one sample two-tier testing. In the first step, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) was measured by fluoroimmunoassay in dried blood spots (DBS) obtained at 3-5 days of life. The cases with positive initial screening were tested by steroid profiling in DBS using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to measure 17-OHP, 21-deoxycortisol (21-S), cortisol (F), 11-deoxycortisol and androstenedione as a second-tier test. The babies with a steroid ratio (21-S+17-OHP)/F of ≥0.5 were referred to pediatric endocrinology clinics for diagnostic assessment.Results:38,935 infants were tested, 2265 (5.82%) required second-tier testing and 212 (0.54%) were referred for clinical assessment, six of whom were diagnosed with CAH (four males, two females). Four cases were identified as SW 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) (two males, two females). One male baby had simple virilizing 21-OHD and one male baby had 11-OHD CAH. The incidence of classical 21-OHD in the screened population was 1:7,787.Conclusion:The incidence of CAH due to classical 21-OHD is higher in Turkey compared to previous reports. We, therefore, suggest that CAH be added to the newborn screening panel in Turkey. The use of steroid profiling as a second-tier test was found to improve the efficacy of the screening and reduce the number of false-positives.Keywords: Newborn screening, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, second-tier, steroid profiling",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6398187/,abstract

ACAD9 also retains enzyme ACAD activity for long-chain fatty acids in vitro, but the biological relevance of this function remains controversial partly because of the tissue specificity of ACAD9 expression: high in liver and neurons and minimal in skin fibroblasts. In this study, we hypothesized that this enzymatic ACAD activity is required for full fatty acid oxidation capacity in cells expressing high levels of ACAD9 and that loss of this function is important in determining phenotype in ACAD9-deficient patients. First, we confirmed that HEK293 cells express ACAD9 abundantly. Then, we showed that ACAD9 knockout in HEK293 cells affected long-chain fatty acid oxidation along with Cl, both of which were rescued by wild type ACAD9. Further, we evaluated whether the loss of ACAD9 enzymatic fatty acid oxidation affects clinical severity in patients with ACAD9 mutations. The effects on ACAD activity of 16 ACAD9 mutations identified in 24 patients were evaluated using a prokaryotic expression system. We showed that there was a significant inverse correlation between residual enzyme ACAD activity and phenotypic severity of ACAD9-deficient patients. These results provide evidence that in cells where it is strongly expressed, ACAD9 plays a physiological role in fatty acid oxidation, which contributes to the severity of the phenotype in ACAD9-deficient patients. Accordingly, treatment of ACAD9 patients should aim at counteracting both CI and fatty acid oxidation dysfunctions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4424958/,abstract

Cystine and theanine were reported to attenuate some chemotherapy-associated AEs, and are also expected to attenuate the AEs caused by capecitabine treatment. Therefore, our present study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of cystine/theanine therapy in patients with colorectal cancer undergoing capecitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.Methods and analysisA multi-institutional, prospective, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II trial is being planned. Patients with colorectal cancer treated with capecitabine as an adjuvant chemotherapy will be randomised into either the cystine/theanine group (n=50) or placebo group (n=50). Data will be collected during four courses of capecitabine therapy. The primary endpoint will be incidence rate of diarrhoea of grade 1 or higher in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) v.4.0, Japanese Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) version. The secondary endpoints are incidence rates of other AEs (CTCAE v.4.0-JCOG), scores of the Japanese version of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire module for all patients with cancer (QLQ-C30) and for patients with colorectal cancer (QLQ-CR29), incidence rate of HFS according to the HFS grading scale, protocol adherence, completion rate of four courses of capecitabine therapy and the proportion of completion without delay or dose reduction, time to completion of four courses of capecitabine and total dose of capecitabine.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 100 participants (81 females and 19 males). The participants had high education levels (only 2% had not completed high school), a mean age of 44 years (SD ± 9.899) and had at least one child with a neurodevelopmental disorder. The diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) had a significant association with past participation in CTs (p < 0.001). A statistical significance for age of diagnosis and participation in CTs was also found (z = −2.01, p = 0.045). The motivating factors were to help find cures/treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders and to relieve symptoms related to child's diagnosis. Factors explaining lack of participation, unwillingness to participate or unsure of participation were: lack of information/knowledge about the trials, time commitment to participation (screening, appointments, assessments, laboratory tests, etc.) and low annual household income. These results show that a portion of underrepresented minorities (URM) not participating in CTs are willing to participate and suggests that reducing barriers, particularly lack of knowledge/information and time commitment to trials are needed to improve recruitment.Keywords: Fragile X syndrome, autism, ASD, clinical trials, health disparities, URM, under represent minorities",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4298644/,abstract

There are important evidence gaps related to the comparative effectiveness of therapies for IMD, which are in part due to challenges in conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for rare diseases. Registry-based RCTs present a unique opportunity to address these challenges provided the registries implement standardized collection of outcomes that are important to patients and their caregivers and to clinical providers and healthcare systems. Currently there is no core outcome set (COS) for studies evaluating interventions for paediatric IMD. This protocol outlines a study that will establish COS for each of two relatively common IMD in children, phenylketonuria (PKU) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency.MethodsThis two-part study is registered with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative. Part 1 includes a rapid review and development of an evidence map to identify a comprehensive listing of outcomes reported in past studies of PKU and MCAD deficiency. The review follows established methods for knowledge synthesis, including a comprehensive search strategy, two stages of screening citations against inclusion/exclusion criteria by two reviewers working independently, and extraction of important data elements from eligible studies, including details of the outcomes collected and outcome measurement instruments. The review findings will inform part 2 of our study, a set of Delphi surveys to establish consensus on the highest priority outcomes for each condition. Healthcare providers, families of children with PKU or MCAD deficiency, and health system decision-makers will be invited to participate in two to three rounds of Delphi surveys. The design of the surveys will involve parents of children with IMD who are part of a family advisory forum.DiscussionThis protocol is a crucial step in developing the capacity to launch RCTs with meaningful outcomes that address comparative effectiveness questions in the field of paediatric IMD. Such trials will contribute high-quality evidence to inform decision-making by patients and their family members, clinicians, and policy-makers.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-017-2327-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Inherited metabolic diseases, Core outcome set, Registry-based randomized trials, PKU, MCAD deficiency, Delphi",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5735866/,abstract

Southeast Brazil, by investigating a series of cases in which the screening test
was abnormal. More specifically, it was aimed to know the information regarding
the neonatal screening received by mothers at the hospital and at primary health
care, in addition to information related to genetic counseling. METHODS: A descriptive study that enrolled 119 mothers, accounting for 73% of all children
born between 2010 and 2011 with abnormal results of neonatal screening for
hemoglobinopathies. The mothers completed a questionnaire that assessed the
information received at hospital and primary health care, and issues related to
genetic counseling. Descriptive statistics was performed. RESULTS: Of the 119 participating mothers, 69 (58%) had children with sickle cell trait,
22 (18.5%) with hemoglobin C trait, 18 (15.1%) with alpha thalassemia trait and,
in 10 cases (8.4%), the result was inconclusive. At the hospital, 118 mothers
(99.2%) received information about where to go to collect the test and 115 (96.6%)

were informed about which diseases are investigated and the risks of not
performing the screening. Seventeen mothers (14.3%) recognized the difference
between trait and disease, and 42 (35.3%) considered that a positive screening
test could have implications for future pregnancies. In 70 cases (58.8%), the

Responders to BH4 may experience a reduction in certain nutrients if not compensated through intact foods or supplements. This study investigated B6, B12, folate, and iron status based on blood levels and dietary intake in patients with PKU responsive to BH4 over 1 year.MethodsFifty-eight patients with PKU, ages 4–50 years were recruited and initiated on BH4 therapy. Patients were monitored for BH4 response, and nutritional status was recorded at regular intervals over 12 months. The analysis included 33 patients with known BH4 response status and complete nutritional data. Nutrient intake was determined by National Data System for Research (NDSR) analysis of self reported 3 day diet records and compared to Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). Blood biomarkers were analyzed by Quest Diagnostics and compared to laboratory reference ranges. Patient laboratory values were compared to controls from the National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES). Differences in nutrient intakes across time points were examined, stratified by age, using nonparametric methods. Statistical analyses were completed with SAS 9.4, with significance set at α = 0.05.ResultsMedical food intake declined among pediatric (p < 0.01) and adult (p = 0.06) BH4 responders over 1 year. Among those < 18 years of age, mean percent of calories obtained from MF declined from 21.3 to 4.7%. In adults, percent calories from MF dropped from 19.5 to 4.0%. Though maintaining laboratory and dietary values within reference ranges, responders < 18 years experienced a significant decline in serum B12 (p = 0.01), dietary folate (p = 0.006), and dietary iron (p = 0.004) over the study.ConclusionAlthough mean dietary and laboratory values for B12, B6, folate, and iron in BH4 responders and non-responders were adequate at baseline and 12-month follow-up, responders experienced a significant decline in serum B12 over 1 year, which may be explained by decreased intake of fortified MF. Both response groups had lower serum B12 than NHANES controls at baseline and 12 months.

However, over the years, it became clear that the strain of mice can influence these results. Nevertheless, identical gene mutations in different strains are often still considered equals. An example of this, is the research done in phenylketonuria (PKU), an inheritable metabolic disorder. In this field, a PKU mouse model (either on a BTBR or C57Bl/6 background) is often used to examine underlying mechanisms of the disease and/or new treatment strategies. Both strains have a point mutation in the gene coding for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase which causes toxic concentrations of the amino acid phenylalanine in blood and brain, as found in PKU patients. Although the mutation is identical and therefore assumed to equally affect physiology and behavior in both strains, no studies directly compared the two genetic backgrounds to test this assumption. Therefore, this study compared the BTBR and C57Bl/6 wild-type and PKU mice on PKU-relevant amino acid- and neurotransmitter-levels and at a behavioral level. The behavioral paradigms were selected from previous literature on the PKU mouse model and address four domains, namely (1) activity levels, (2) motor performance, (3) anxiety and/or depression-like behavior, and (4) learning and memory. The results of this study showed comparable biochemical changes in phenylalanine and neurotransmitter concentrations. In contrast, clear differences in behavioral outcome between the strains in all four above-mentioned domains were found, most notably in the learning and memory domain. The outcome in this domain seem to be primarily due to factors inherent to the genetic background of the mouse and much less by differences in PKU-specific biochemical parameters in blood and brain. The difference in behavioral outcome between PKU of both strains emphasizes that the consequence of the PAH mutation is influenced by other factors than Phe levels alone. Therefore, future research should consider these differences when choosing one of the genetic strains to investigate the pathophysiological mechanism underlying PKU-related behavior, especially when combined with new treatment strategies.Keywords: strain, pah mutation, novel object recognition, spatial memory, phenylketonuria, mouse models, genotype, phenotype",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5167755/,abstract

However, the contribution of aging processes to AD etiology remains unclear. Emerging evidence shows that reduced brain metabolic and vascular functions occur decades before the onset of cognitive impairments, and these reductions are highly associated with low-grade, chronic inflammation developed in the brain over time. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that the gut microbiota may also play a critical role in modulating immune responses in the brain via the brain-gut axis. In this study, our goal was to identify associations between deleterious changes in brain metabolism, cerebral blood flow (CBF), gut microbiome and cognition in aging, and potential implications for AD development. We conducted our study with a group of young mice (5–6 months of age) and compared those to old mice (18–20 months of age) by utilizing metabolic profiling, neuroimaging, gut microbiome analysis, behavioral assessments and biochemical assays. We found that compared to young mice, old mice had significantly increased levels of numerous amino acids and fatty acids that are highly associated with inflammation and AD biomarkers. In the gut microbiome analyses, we found that old mice had increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and alpha diversity. We also found impaired blood-brain barrier (BBB) function and reduced CBF as well as compromised learning and memory and increased anxiety, clinical symptoms often seen in AD patients, in old mice. Our study suggests that the aging process involves deleterious changes in brain metabolic, vascular and cognitive functions, and gut microbiome structure and diversity, all which may lead to inflammation and thus increase the risk for AD. Future studies conducting comprehensive and integrative characterization of brain aging, including crosstalk with peripheral systems and factors, will be necessary to define the mechanisms underlying the shift from normal aging to pathological processes in the etiology of AD.Keywords: aging, MRI, brain metabolism, neurovascular function, gut microbiome, cognition, anxiety, Alzheimer’s disease",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5622159/,abstract

Cognitive functions are generally thought to be spared, but have not yet been studied in detail.MethodsThirty patients detected by newborn screening (n = 13), high-risk screening (n = 3) or targeted metabolic testing (n = 14) were studied for simple reaction time (SRT), continuous performance (CP), visual working memory (VWM), visual-motor coordination (Tracking) and visual search (VS). Dystonia (n = 13 patients) was categorized using the Barry-Albright-Dystonia Scale (BADS). Patients were compared with 196 healthy controls. Developmental functions of cognitive performances were analysed using a negative exponential function model.ResultsBADS scores correlated with speed tests but not with tests measuring stability or higher cognitive functions without time constraints. Developmental functions of GA-I patients significantly differed from controls for SRT and VS but not for VWM and showed obvious trends for CP and Tracking. Dystonic patients were slower in SRT and CP but reached their asymptote of performance similar to asymptomatic patients and controls in all tests. Asymptomatic patients did not differ from controls, except showing significantly better results in Tracking and a trend for slower reactions in visual search. Data across all age groups of patients and controls fitted well to a model of negative exponential development.ConclusionsDystonic patients predominantly showed motor speed impairment, whereas performance improved with higher cognitive load. Patients without motor symptoms did not differ from controls. Developmental functions of cognitive performances were similar in patients and controls.

The present study aimed to investigate the status of molecular defects in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in western Iranian PKU patients (predominantly from Kermanshah, Hamadan, and Lorestan provinces) during 2014-2016. Additionally, the results were compared with similar studies in Iran. Nucleotide sequence analysis of all 13 exons and their flanking intronic regions of the PAH gene was performed in 18 western Iranian PKU patients. Moreover, a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) located in the PAH gene was studied. The results revealed a mutational spectrum encompassing 11 distinct mutations distributed along the PAH gene sequence on 34 of the 36 mutant alleles (diagnostic efficiency of 94.4%). Also, four PAH VNTR alleles (with repeats of 3, 7, 8 and 9) were detected. The three most frequent mutations were IVS9+5G>A, IVS7-5T>C, and p.P281L with the frequency of 27.8%, 11%, and 11%, respectively. The results showed that there is not only a consanguineous relation, but also a difference in PAH characters of mutations between Kermanshah and the other two parts of western Iran (Hamadan and Lorestan). Also, it seems that the spectrum of mutations in western Iran is relatively distinct from other parts of the country, suggesting that this region might be a special PAH gene distribution region. Moreover, our findings can be useful in the identification of genotype to phenotype relationship in patients, and provide future abilities for confirmatory diagnostic testing, prognosis, and predict the severity of PKU patients.

An early diagnosis, treatment, and specific medical support must be performed to prevent Status Epilepticus (SE). Seizure onset, especially in the child population, is related to specific risk factors like positive family history, fever, infections, neurological comorbidity, premature birth, mother’s alcohol abuse, and smoking in pregnancy. Early death risk in children without neurological comorbidity is similar to the general population. Diagnosis is generally based on the identification of continuous or recurrent seizures but Electroencephalogram (EEG) evaluation could be useful if SE condition is suspected. The main goal of therapy is to counteract the pathological mechanism which occurs in SE before neural cells are irreversibly damaged. According to the latest International Guidelines and Recommendations of seizure related diseases, a schematic and multi-stage pharmacological and diagnostic approach is proposed especially in the management of SE and its related causes in children.

Therefore, the stable expression of specific inhibitors of E6 and E7 in cancer cells is expected to provide effective treatment for cervical cancer without affecting normal tissue. In this study, we propose a novel therapeutic approach using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against the onco-proteins E6 and E7 (shE6E7) of HPV type 16 (HPV-16), termed AAV-shE6E7. Three different HPV-16-positive cervical cancer cell lines (BOKU, SiHa and SKG-IIIa cells) were tested for gene transfer efficiency using serotypes of AAV vectors. For in vitro analysis, the cells were transduced AAV-shE6E7; alternatively, in vivo studies were performed via the administration of a direct injection of AAV-shE6E7 into cervical cancer cell-derived tumors in mice. The high gene transfer efficiency was observed using AAV2 in all three cervical cancer cell lines. Following transduction, we observed apoptosis, G1 phase arrest and cell growth inhibition. Additionally, in the transduced cells, the E6, E7 and p16 expression levels decreased, whereas the expression levels of p53, p21 and pRb levels were enhanced. The growth of subcutaneously transplanted tumors was markedly inhibited by the single administration of AAV2-shE6E7, and the tumors were almost completely eradicated without any adverse effects. These results provided evidence of the utility of AAV2-shE6E7 as a novel treatment approach for cervical cancer.Keywords: cervical cancer, adeno-associated virus vector, short hairpin RNA, human papillomavirus, E6, E7, p53, Rb, apoptosis, gene transfer efficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5807046/,abstract

Although the underlying biological mechanisms remain largely unknown, clefts are thought to be complex disorders influenced by genetic, environmental, and potentially epigenetic factors.MethodsIn blood samples from 2- to 3-day-old infants (n = 747) collected in a nationwide population-based study of orofacial clefts in Norway, we measured DNA methylation profiles for more than 450,000 CpGs and then conducted epigenome-wide association analyses (EWAS). We tested methylation profile difference at each CpG between controls (n = 436) and each of the cleft subtypes (92 cleft lip only, CLO; 84 cleft palate only, CPO; 132 cleft lip and palate, CLP). We also compared controls to various combinations of case groups and compared case subtypes to each other. Finally, using the EWAS results, we searched for larger differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with orofacial clefts.ResultsIn EWAS comparing controls to individual cleft subtypes, we found no significant associations at a Bonferroni P value threshold of 10−7. After pooling case groups, we found two significantly differentially methylated CpGs: cg09696939 near gene BICC1 is associated with CLO+CLP (P = 9.58 × 10−8); cg26985354 in gene CLASRP is associated with CPO+CLP (P = 7.38 × 10−8). In DMR analysis, we identified a total of 56 significant regions when comparing controls to individual cleft subtypes (10 for CLO, 6 for CPO, 41 for CLP). Only one DMR is shared among the three cleft groups. In combined case group analysis, we found 26 DMRs for CLP+CLO, 31 for CLP+CPO, and 37 when all subtypes are combined. Finally, in case-case comparisons of subtypes, we identified 10 DMRs when comparing CLP to CPO, 9 in CLP compared to CLO, and 13 in CLP compared to CPO.ConclusionsWe identified two individual CpGs and multiple DMRs that differ between controls and cleft case subtypes.

Clinical presentation varies, but typically includes infant-onset chronic diarrhea, juvenile-onset bilateral cataracts, and later-onset tendinous xanthomas and progressive neurological dysfunction. CYP27A1 plays an essential role in side-chain oxidation of cholesterol necessary for the synthesis of the bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and perturbations in this gene that reduce enzyme activity result in elevations of cholestanol. It is commonly held that CTX is exceedingly rare, but epidemiological studies are lacking. In order to provide an accurate incidence estimate of CTX, we studied the ExAC cohort of ~60,000 unrelated adults from global populations to determine the allele frequency of the 57 variants in CYP27A1 reported pathogenic for CTX. In addition, we conducted bioinformatics analyses on these CTX-causing variants and determined a bioinformatics profile to predict variants that may be pathogenic but have not yet been reported in the CTX patient literature. An additional 29 variants were identified that met bioinformatics criteria for being potentially pathogenic. Incidence was estimated based allele frequencies of pathogenic CTX variants plus those determined to be potentially pathogenic. One variant, p.P384L, previously reported in three unrelated CTX families had an allele frequency ≥ 1% in European, Latino and Asian populations. Three additional mutations had a frequency of ≥ 0.1% in Asian populations. CTX disease incidence was calculated excluding the high frequency p.P384L and separately using a genetic paradigm where this high frequency variant only causes classic CTX when paired in trans with a null variant. These calculations place CTX incidence ranging from 1:134,970 – 1:461,358 in Europeans, 1:263,222 – 1:468,624 in Africans, 1:71,677 – 1:148,914 in Americans, 1:64,267 – 1:64,712 in East Asians and 1:36,072 – 1:75,601 in South Asians.

It is well-recognized that studying ADHD dimensionally is more controlled for comorbid problems and medication effects, and provides more accurate assessment of the symptoms. Therefore, the present study applied the dimensional approach to test the relationship between brain lateralization and self-reported ADHD symptoms in a population sample. Eighty-five right-handed university students filled in the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales and performed a lateralization reaction time task. The task consists of two matching conditions: one condition requires nominal identification for letters tapping left hemisphere specialization (Letter Name-Identity condition) and the other one requires physical and visuospatial identification for shapes tapping right hemisphere specialization (Shape Physical-Identity condition). The letters or shapes to be matched are presented in left or right visual field of a fixation cross. For both task conditions, brain lateralization was indexed as the difference in mean reaction time between left and right visual field. Linear regression analyses, controlled for mood symptoms reported by a depression, anxiety, and stress scale, showed no relationship between the variables. These findings from a population sample of adults do not support the dimensionality of lateralized information processing deficit in ADHD symptomatology. However, group comparison analyses showed that subjects with high level of inattention symptoms close to or above the clinical cut-off had a reduced right hemisphere processing in the Shape Physical-Identity condition.Keywords: self-report, adults population, ADHD symptoms, brain lateralization, dimensional approach",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4585266/,abstract

Multicomponent driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) has been proposed as a rapid approach for multicomponent relaxometry and has been applied to map MWF in human brain. However, even for the simplest two-pool signal model consisting of MWF and non-myelin-associated water, the dimensionality of the parameter space for obtaining MWF estimates remains high. This renders parameter estimation difficult, especially at low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), due to the presence of local minima and the flatness of the fit residual energy surface used for parameter determination using conventional nonlinear least squares (NLLS)-based algorithms. In this study, we introduce three Bayesian approaches for analysis of the mcDESPOT signal model to determine MWF. Given the high dimensional nature of mcDESPOT signal model, and, thereby, the high dimensional marginalizations over nuisance parameters needed to derive the posterior probability distribution of MWF parameter, the introduced Bayesian analyses use different approaches to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space. The first approach uses normalization by average signal amplitude, and assumes that noise can be accurately estimated from signal-free regions of the image. The second approach likewise uses average amplitude normalization, but incorporates a full treatment of noise as an unknown variable through marginalization. The third approach does not use amplitude normalization and incorporates marginalization over both noise and signal amplitude. Through extensive Monte Carlo numerical simulations and analysis of in-vivo human brain datasets exhibiting a range of SNR and spatial resolution, we demonstrated the markedly improved accuracy and precision in the estimation of MWF using these Bayesian methods as compared to the stochastic region contraction (SRC) implementation of NLLS.Keywords: mcDESPOT, Myelin water fraction, Bayesian analysis, Stochastic region contraction algorithm, Nonlinear least squares, Brain",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854306/,abstract

Current treatment consists of 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) and a tyrosine and phenylalanine restricted diet. Recently, neuropsychological deficits have been seen in HT1 patients. These deficits are possibly associated with low blood phenylalanine concentrations and/or high blood tyrosine concentrations. Therefore, the aim of the present study was threefold. Firstly, we aimed to calculate how the plasma amino acid profile in HT1 patients may influence the presumptive brain influx of all large neutral amino acids (LNAA). Secondly, we aimed to investigate the effect of phenylalanine supplementation on presumptive brain phenylalanine and tyrosine influx. Thirdly, we aimed to theoretically determine minimal target plasma phenylalanine concentrations in HT1 patient to ensure adequate presumptive brain phenylalanine influx.MethodsData of plasma LNAA concentrations were obtained. In total, 239 samples of 9 HT1 children, treated with NTBC, diet, and partly with phenylalanine supplementation were collected together with 596 samples of independent control children. Presumptive brain influx of all LNAA was calculated, using Michaelis-Menten parameters (Km) and Vmax-values obtained from earlier articles.ResultsIn HT1 patients, plasma concentrations and presumptive brain influx of tyrosine were higher. However, plasma and especially brain influx of phenylalanine were lower in HT1 patients. Phenylalanine supplementation did not only tend to increase plasma phenylalanine concentrations, but also presumptive brain phenylalanine influx, despite increased plasma tyrosine concentrations. However, to ensure sufficient brain phenylalanine influx in HT1 patients, minimal plasma phenylalanine concentrations may need to be higher than considered thus far.ConclusionThis study clearly suggests a role for disturbed brain LNAA biochemistry, which is not well reflected by plasma LNAA concentrations.

This study investigates the potential for an innovative intervention combining two existing services; a free state-wide telephone-based health coaching service and hospital-based antenatal care to support pregnant women to achieve healthy weight gain during pregnancy. The use of existing services provides the potential for immediate post-study implementation. While the impacts of telephone-based lifestyle programmes have been tested in a number of settings, there are few studies which evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of telephone support in achieving healthy gestational weight gain in association with routine antenatal care.Trial registrationACTRN12615000397516 (Registration date: 26 June 2014, retrospectively registered).Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12913-016-1704-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Health promotion, Health coaching, Gestational weight gain, Obesity, Maternal obesity",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5006383/,abstract

The duration of recently completed drug trials that support approval for drug therapy in children with chronic diseases has not been systematically evaluated. Such information is a vital first step in forming safety pharmacovigilance strategies for drugs used for long-term therapy in children.OBJECTIVETo characterize the duration of clinical trials submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pediatric drug approvals, with a focus on drugs used for long-term therapy.DESIGN AND SETTINGA review was performed of all safety and efficacy clinical trials conducted under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act or the Pediatric Review Equity Act and submitted to the FDA from September 1, 2007, to December 31, 2014, to support the approval of drugs frequently used for long-term therapy in children. Statistical analysis was performed from July 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESMaximum duration of trials submitted to support FDA approval of drugs for children.RESULTSA total of 306 trials supporting 86 drugs intended for long-term use in children were eligible for the primary analysis. The drugs most commonly evaluated were for treatment of neurologic (25 [29%]), pulmonary (16 [19%]), and anti-infective (14 [16%]) indications. The median maximum trial duration by drug was 44 weeks (minimum, 1.1 week; maximum, 364 weeks). For nearly two-thirds of the drugs (52 [61%]), the maximum trial duration was less than 52 weeks. For 10 of the drugs (12%), the maximum trial duration was 3 years or more. Maximum duration of trials did not vary by therapeutic category, minimum age of enrollment, calendar year, or legislative mandate.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEPediatric clinical trials designed to sufficiently investigate drug safety and efficacy to support FDA approval are of relatively limited duration. Given the potential long-term exposure of patients to these drugs, the clinical community should consider whether new approaches are needed to better understand the safety associated with long-term use of these drugs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6526087/,abstract

In PKU, the metabolic pathway of phenylalanine is disrupted, which, among others, causes deficits in the neurotransmitters and sleep modulators dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Understanding sleep problems in PKU patients may help explain the pathophysiology of brain dysfunction in PKU patients. In this explorative study, we investigated possible sleep problems in adult treated PKU patients and untreated PKU mice. In the PKU patients, sleep characteristics were compared to healthy first degree relatives by assessment of sleep disturbances, sleep–wake patterns, and sleepiness with the help of four questionnaires: Holland sleep disorder questionnaire, Pittsburgh sleep quality index, Epworth sleepiness scale, and Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. The results obtained with the questionnaires show that PKU individuals suffer more from sleep disorders, a reduced sleep quality, and an increased latency to fall asleep and experience more sleepiness during the day. In the PKU mice, activity patterns were recorded with passive infrared recorders. PKU mice switched more often between active and non-active behavior and shifted a part of their resting behavior into the active period, confirming that sleep quality is affected as a consequence of PKU. Together, these results give the first indication that sleep problems are present in PKU. More detailed future research will give a better understanding of these problems, which could ultimately result in the improvement of treatment strategies by including sleep quality as an additional treatment target.Keywords: inherited metabolic disorder, Pahenu2 mice, phenylketonuria patients, phenylketonuria mice, neurotransmitters, sleep disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405067/,abstract

For many years the regulation of practices was self-imposed, decentralised and idiosyncratic. The advent of ‘therapeutic modernity’ in the 1990s gave rise to an ethical, legal and scientific framework designed to homogenise PND at a national level, with the creation of multidisciplinary centres (CPDPN) and the Agence de la biomédecine. This article first recovers the history of PND in France. It then compares the activities of two CPDPNs, using ethnographic fieldwork and by analysing national quantitative data compiled by the Agence. It argues that the official policy of nationally homogeneous practices is not born out in practice, at the local level. This lack of homogeneity is most apparent in the number of authorisations for pregnancy termination due to foetal malformation, which varies considerably from one centre to another. Rooted in local culture, this variation relates to organisational methods, decision-making processes and variable levels of tolerance towards the risk of disability. Foetal medicine practitioners, thus, maintain a certain amount of autonomy that is collective rather than individual and that is reflected in the particular ‘identity’ of a given centre.

Genetic competencies common to all health professionals have been identified by the US National Coalition for Health Professional Education in Genetics (NCHPEG), which defined the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required to achieve these competencies. The aim of this study is to analyze genetic competencies of primary health care professionals in Brazil. It is a descriptive survey study, whereby doctors, nurses, and dentists were invited to participate by answering a questionnaire including 11 issues based on competencies established by the NCHPEG. Data were presented as percentages. Differences between groups of participants were assessed by the Fisher exact test, with the level of significance set at p < 0.05. Results showed that concerning knowledge, about 80 % of the participants recognized basic genetics terminology, but practitioners had difficulty in identifying patterns of inheritance. Regarding clinical skills, practitioners were able to recognize facial dysmorphias and identify situations where referral of patients to specialists was necessary. Nevertheless, there were challenges in the process of valuing and gathering information about family history. Regarding attitudes, 68.9 % of the participants thought about the comprehensiveness of care but faced challenges in counselling parents. The results of this study may contribute to developing an ongoing education program for primary health care professionals, leading to a strategy to overcome the challenges of including genetics in the Brazilian Unified Health System.Keywords: Brazil, Unified Health System, Primary health care, Medical genetics, Clinical competence, Continuous professional development",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4524835/,abstract

Neuropsychological functioning was assessed in 1549 adolescents, at baseline and follow-up (mean ages 11 and 19 years). The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to classify adolescents into 4 groups: ADHD with onset of depression, only ADHD, only depression, and neither ADHD nor depression. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyse group differences in cognitive functioning at baseline and follow-up, and the change in cognitive functioning between these 2 time-points. Results showed a significant main effect of group on response time variability at baseline, working memory maintenance at follow up, and change in response time variability scores between baseline and follow-up. As compared to the healthy and depressed-only groups, adolescents with only ADHD showed longer response time variability at baseline and, which declined between baseline and follow-up. Adolescents with ADHD plus depression showed higher reaction time for working memory maintenance than the depressed only and healthy groups at follow-up. In conclusion, adolescents with self-reported ADHD show poorer cognitive functioning than healthy adolescents and those with only depression. Amongst adolescents with ADHD, specific cognitive domains show poor functioning depending on the presence or absence of comorbid depression.

Technological developments have triggered a two-fold transition in carrier screening: the expansion from screening one single disorder to many disorders simultaneously, and offering screening universally, regardless of ancestry. This study aims to identify general and population-specific barriers and needs reflected by stakeholders regarding the implementation of carrier screening in a changing landscape.MethodsSeventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with Dutch key stakeholders working in the practical and scientific field of carrier screening. The constellation approach was used to categorise barriers and needs into three levels: culture, structure and practice.ResultsBarriers on a cultural level include: undecidedness about the desirability of carrier screening, and a lack of priority of screening in mainstream healthcare. On a structural level barriers included: need for organisational structures in healthcare for embedding carrier screening, need for guidelines, financial structures, practical tools for overcoming challenges during counselling, and a need for training and education of both professionals and the public. A lack of demand for screening by the public, and a need for a division of responsibilities were barriers on a practical level.ConclusionThe absence of a collective sense of urgency for genetic carrier screening, a lack of organisational structures, and uncertainty or even disagreement about the responsibilities seem to be important barriers in the implementation of carrier screening.

Many lines of evidence indicated that ASD shares common genetic variants with other psychiatric disorders (for example, schizophrenia). Previous studies detected that calcium channels are involved in the etiology of many psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and autism. Significant association between CACNA1C (calcium channel, voltage-dependent, L type, alpha 1C subunit) and schizophrenia was detected. Furthermore, rare mutation in CACNA1C is suggested to cause Timothy syndrome, a multisystem disorder including autism-associated phenotype. However, there is no evidence for association between CACNA1C and autism in Chinese Han population. To investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in CACNA1C and autism, we first performed a family-based association study between eighteen SNPs in CACNA1C and autism in 239 trios. All SNPs were genotyped by using Sequenom genotyping platform. Two SNPs (rs1006737 and rs4765905) have a trend of association with autism. To further confirm the association between these two SNPs with autism, we expanded the sample size to 553 trios by adding 314 trios. Association analyses for SNPs and haplotype were performed by using family-based association test (FBAT) and Haploview software. Permutation tests were used for multiple testing corrections of the haplotype analyses (n=10,000). The significance level for all statistical tests was two-tailed (p<0.05). The results demonstrated that G allele of rs1006737 and G allele of rs4765905 showed a preferential transmission to affected offspring in 553 trios (p=0.035). Haplotype analyses showed that two haplotypes constructed from rs1006737 and rs4765905 were significantly associated with autism (p=0.030, 0.023, respectively; Global p=0.046).

Background: Knowing the phenylalanine (Phe) content of foods is essential for managing the diet of patients with phenylketonuria. Data on the Phe content of foods are scarce and sometimes vary between different Food Composition Tables (FCT). Brazil created its own table of the Phe contents of fruits and vegetables based exclusively on the chemical analysis of protein content, considering that proteins contain 3–4% Phe (TCFA/ANVISA). This study compared the protein and Phe contents of vegetables and fruits provided by the TCFA/ANVISA with those listed in international food composition tables.
Methods: The Phe content of 71 fruits and vegetables listed in TCFA/ANVISA was classified into four subgroups, and the Wilcoxon nonparametric test compared the Phe and mean protein contents provided by the FCTs. All tests considered the bilateral hypothesis, and the level of significance was set at 5%. The Spearman’s correlation coefficient measured the statistical dependence between Phe and protein contents.
Results: The mean Phe content was <50 mg Phe/100 g for 15 fruits; >50 mg/100 g for 11 type-A vegetables; <50 mg/100 g for 8 type-B vegetables; ≤50 mg/100 g for 7 type-C vegetables. The percentage of Phe in protein varied from 3.13 ± 1.03% to 3.74 ± 2.55% in fruits; 3.33 ± 1.41 to 4.82 ± 1.17 in type-A vegetables; 3.46 ± 1.25% to 4.83 ± 2.46 in type-B vegetables; and 3.14% ± 1.49 to 4.62% ± 2.26 in type-C vegetables.
Conclusions: The Phe and protein contents provided by most FCTs were positively correlated, suggesting that it is possible to estimate the Phe content of fruits by multiplying its protein content by 3%. For type-A, -B, and -C vegetables, 4% may be used.Keywords: Food composition tables, Phenylalanine, Phenylalanine restricted diet, Phenylketonuria",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5509543/,abstract

Growing evidence suggests that wheel running simulates exercise effects in many mouse models of human conditions, but this activity also might change other aspects of mouse behavior. In this case study, we show that the presence of running wheels leads to pronounced and permanent circling behavior with route-tracing in a proportion of the male mice of a genetically distinct cohort. The genetic background of this cohort includes a mutation in Arhgap19, but genetic crosses showed that an unknown second-site mutation likely caused the induced circling behavior. Behavioral tests for inner-ear function indicated a normal sense of gravity in the circling mice. However, the levels of dopamine, serotonin, and some dopamine metabolites were lower in the brains of circling male mice than in mice of the same genetic background that were weaned without wheels. Circling was seen in both singly and socially housed male mice. The additional stress of fighting may have exacerbated the predisposition to circling in the socially housed animals. Singly and socially housed male mice without wheels did not circle. Our current findings highlight the importance and possibly confounding nature of the environmental and genetic background in mouse behavioral studies, given that the circling behavior and alterations in dopamine and serotonin levels in this mouse cohort occurred only when the male mice were housed with running wheels.Abbreviation: DOPAC, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5361047/,abstract

Thus, the elaboration of new evidence-based recommendations for iNMD diagnosis and management is increasingly requested by health care professionals and patients, even though the methodological quality of existing guidelines is largely unclear. InNerMeD-I-Network is the first European network on iNMDs that was created with the aim of sharing and increasing validated information about diagnosis and management of neurometabolic disorders.

Background: High phenylalanine levels in phenylketonuria (PKU) have been associated with brain oxidative stress and amino acid imbalance. Exercise has been shown to improve brain function in hyperphenylalaninemia and neurodegenerative diseases. This study aimed to verify the effects of exercise on coordination and balance, plasma and brain amino acid levels, and brain oxidative stress markers in PKU mice.
Methods: Twenty wild-type (WT) and 20 PAHenu2 (PKU) C57BL/6 mice were placed in cages with (exercise, Exe) or without (sedentary, Sed) running wheels during 53 days. At day 43, a balance beam test was performed. Plasma and brain were collected for analyses of amino acid levels and the oxidative stress parameters superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, sulfhydryl and reduced glutathione (GSH) contents, total radical-trapping antioxidant potential (TRAP), and total antioxidant reactivity (TAR).
Results: SedPKU showed poor coordination (p < 0.001) and balance (p < 0.001), higher plasma and brain phenylalanine (p < 0.001), and increased brain oxidative stress (p < 0.05) in comparison to SedWT. ExePKU animals ran less than ExeWT (p = 0.018). Although no improvement was seen in motor coordination and balance, exercise in PKU restored SOD, sulfhydryl content, and TRAP levels to controls. TAR levels were increased in ExePKU in comparison to SedPKU (p = 0.012). Exercise decreased plasma and brain glucogenic amino acids in ExePKU, but did not change plasma and brain phenylalanine in both WT and PKU.
Conclusions: Exercise prevents oxidative stress in the brain of PKU mice without modifying phenylalanine levels. Hence, exercise positively affects the brain, demonstrating its value as an intervention to improve brain quality in PKU.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this chapter (doi:10.1007/8904_2015_498) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5580734/,abstract
1002,10.1186/s12881-015-0240-8,26542245,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundIn humans, Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (MTOR) encodes a 300 kDa serine/ threonine protein kinase that is ubiquitously expressed, particularly at high levels in brain. MTOR functions as an integrator of multiple cellular processes, and in so doing either directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of at least 800 proteins. While somatic MTOR mutations have been recognized in tumors for many years, and more recently in hemimegalencephaly, germline MTOR mutations have rarely been described.Case presentationWe report the successful application of family-trio Diagnostic Exome Sequencing (DES) to identify the underlying molecular etiology in two brothers with multiple neurological and developmental lesions, and for whom previous testing was non-diagnostic. The affected brothers, who were 6 and 23 years of age at the time of DES, presented symptoms including but not limited to mild Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), megalencephaly, gross motor skill delay, cryptorchidism and bilateral iris coloboma. Importantly, we determined that each affected brother harbored the MTOR missense alteration p.E1799K (c.5395G>A). This exact variant has been previously identified in multiple independent human somatic cancer samples and has been shown to result in increased MTOR activation. Further, recent independent reports describe two unrelated families in whom p.E1799K co-segregated with megalencephaly and intellectual disability (ID); in both cases, p.E1799K was shown to have originated due to germline mosaicism. In the case of the family reported herein, the absence of p.E1799K in genomic DNA extracted from the blood of either parent suggests that this alteration most likely arose due to gonadal mosaicism. Further, the p.E1799K variant exerts its effect by a gain-of-function (GOF), autosomal dominant mechanism.ConclusionHerein, we describe the use of DES to uncover an activating MTOR missense alteration of gonadal mosaic origin that is likely to be the causative mutation in two brothers who present multiple neurological and developmental abnormalities. Our report brings the total number of families who harbor MTOR p.E1799K in association with megalencephaly and ID to three. In each case, evidence suggests that p.E1799K arose in the affected individuals due to gonadal mosaicism. Thus, MTOR p.E1799K can now be classified as a pathogenic GOF mutation that causes megalencephaly and cognitive impairment in humans.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12881-015-0240-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Diagnostic exome sequencing, Family-trio, MTOR, Autism, ASD, Macrocephaly, Megalencephaly, Gonadal mosaicism, Gain-of-function, Missense alteration",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4635597/,abstract

Male ENU2 mice showed increased mGlu5 receptor protein levels in the hippocampus and corpus striatum (but not in the prefrontal cortex) whereas the transcript of the mGlu5 receptor was unchanged. No changes in mGlu1 receptor mRNA and protein levels were found in any of the three brain regions of ENU2 mice. We extended the analysis to Homer proteins, which act as scaffolds by linking mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors to effector proteins. Expression of the long isoforms of Homer was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of ENU2 mice, whereas levels of the short Homer isoform (Homer 1a) were unchanged. mGlu5 receptors were less associated to immunoprecipitated Homer in the hippocampus of ENU2 mice. The lack of mGlu5 receptor-mediated long-term depression (LTD) in wild-type mice (of BTBR strain) precluded the analysis of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in ENU2 mice. We therefore performed a behavioral analysis to examine whether pharmacological blockade of mGlu5 receptors could correct behavioral abnormalities in ENU2 mice. Using the same apparatus we sequentially assessed locomotor activity, object exploration, and spatial object recognition (spatial novelty test) after displacing some of the objects from their original position in the arena. Systemic treatment with the mGlu5 receptor antagonist, MPEP (20 mg/kg, i.p.), had a striking effect in the spatial novelty test by substantially increasing the time spent in exploring the displaced objects in ENU2 mice (but not in wild-type mice). These suggest a role for mGlu5 receptors in the pathophysiology of ID in PKU and suggest that, also in adult untreated animals, cognitive dysfunction may be improved by targeting these receptors with an appropriate therapy.Keywords: phenylketonuria, mGluR5, hippocampus, intellectual disability, ENU2 mice",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5864888/,abstract

Consistently, SNAP-25 polymorphisms in humans are associated with hyperactivity and/or with low cognitive scores. We analysed five SNAP-25 gene polymorphisms (rs363050, rs363039, rs363043, rs3746544 and rs1051312) in 46 autistic children trying to correlate them with Childhood Autism Rating Scale and electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities. The functional effects of rs363050 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the gene transcriptional activity, by means of the luciferase reporter gene, were evaluated. To investigate the functional consequences that SNAP-25 reduction may have in children, the behaviour and EEG of SNAP-25+/− adolescent mice (SNAP-25+/+) were studied. Significant association of SNAP-25 polymorphism with decreasing cognitive scores was observed. Analysis of transcriptional activity revealed that SNP rs363050 encompasses a regulatory element, leading to protein expression decrease. Reduction of SNAP-25 levels in adolescent mice was associated with hyperactivity, cognitive and social impairment and an abnormal EEG, characterized by the occurrence of frequent spikes. Both EEG abnormalities and behavioural deficits were rescued by repeated exposure for 21 days to sodium salt valproate (VLP). A partial recovery of SNAP-25 expression content in SNAP-25+/− hippocampi was also observed by means of western blotting. A reduced expression of SNAP-25 is responsible for the cognitive deficits in children affected by autism spectrum disorders, as presumably occurring in the presence of rs363050(G) allele, and for behavioural and EEG alterations in adolescent mice. VLP treatment could result in novel therapeutic strategies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4312830/,abstract

The present study evaluated the impact of two doses of EA extract compared with ibuprofen on the severity of disease in patients with knee OA. This study was designed as a randomized, double blind, active-controlled and parallel group trial. Patients with OA were randomized to receive 300 mg/day (n=33) or 600 mg/day (n=32) of EA aqueous extract, or 800 mg/day ibuprofen (n=32) for 7 weeks. EA extract contained 0.21 % (w/w) kaempferol according to HPLC. Efficacy of treatment was assessed using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain, Lequesne's Pain-Function Index (LPFI), and patient's global assessment (PGA) index. The amount of kaempferol in the extract was determined by HPLC method to be 0.21 % w/w. There were significant reductions in WOMAC, VAS, LPFI and PGA scores by the end of trial with all three interventions. Comparison of the changes in WOMAC, VAS and LPFI scores among the treatment groups did not reveal any significant difference between EA and ibuprofen, and between low and high doses of EA. EA was safe and well tolerated during the course of trial and no adverse event was reported.

The BOD1 protein is required for proper chromosome segregation, regulating phosphorylation of PLK1 substrates by modulating Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity during mitosis. We report that fibroblast cell lines derived from homozygous BOD1 mutation carriers show aberrant localisation of the cell cycle kinase PLK1 and its phosphatase PP2A at mitotic kinetochores. However, in contrast to the mitotic arrest observed in BOD1-siRNA treated HeLa cells, patient-derived cells progressed through mitosis with no apparent segregation defects but at an accelerated rate compared to controls. The relatively normal cell cycle progression observed in cultured cells is in line with the absence of gross structural brain abnormalities in the affected individuals. Moreover, we found that in normal adult brain tissues BOD1 expression is maintained at considerable levels, in contrast to PLK1 expression, and provide evidence for synaptic localization of Bod1 in murine neurons. These observations suggest that BOD1 plays a cell cycle-independent role in the nervous system. To address this possibility, we established two Drosophila models, where neuron-specific knockdown of BOD1 caused pronounced learning deficits and significant abnormalities in synapse morphology. Together our results reveal novel postmitotic functions of BOD1 as well as pathogenic mechanisms that strongly support a causative role of BOD1 deficiency in the aetiology of intellectual disability. Moreover, by demonstrating its requirement for cognitive function in humans and Drosophila we provide evidence for a conserved role of BOD1 in the development and maintenance of cognitive features.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4864283/,abstract

In this study, we confirmed the occurrence of brain dopamine and serotonin deficiencies in association with severe behavioral alterations and cognitive impairments in hyperphenylalaninemic C57BL/6-Pahenu2/enu2 mice, a model of human PKU. Phenylalanine-reducing treatments, including either dietary phenylalanine restriction or liver-directed gene therapy, initiated during adulthood were associated with increased brain monoamine content along with improvements in nesting behavior but without a change in the severe cognitive deficits exhibited by these mice. At euthanasia, there was in Pahenu2/enu2 brain a significant reduction in the protein abundance and maximally stimulated activities of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), the rate limiting enzymes catalyzing neuronal dopamine and serotonin synthesis respectively, in comparison to levels seen in wild type brain. Phenylalanine-reducing treatments initiated during adulthood did not affect brain TH or TPH2 content or maximal activity. Despite this apparent fixed deficit in striatal TH and TPH2 activities, initiation of phenylalanine-reducing treatments yielded substantial correction of brain monoamine neurotransmitter content, suggesting that phenylalanine-mediated competitive inhibition of already constitutively reduced TH and TPH2 activities is the primary cause of brain monoamine deficiency in Pahenu2 mouse brain. We propose that CNS monoamine deficiency may be the cause of the partially reversible adverse behavioral effects associated with chronic HPA in Pahenu2 mice, but that phenylalanine-reducing treatments initiated during adulthood are unable to correct the neuropathology and attendant cognitive deficits that develop during juvenile life in late-treated Pahenu2/enu2 mice.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine, tryptophan, dopamine, serotonin, tyrosine hydroxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase, cognition, behavior",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5786171/,abstract

The impact of metabolic diseases and concordant movement disorders upon children’s health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its physical and psychosocial domains of functioning has never been investigated. We therefore conducted a case study on the HRQOL and development of adaptive functioning in children with an IEM and a movement disorder.MethodsChildren with co-existent IEM and movement disorders were recruited from paediatric outpatient clinics. We systematically collected clinical data and videotaped examinations. The movement disorders were diagnosed by a panel of specialists. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale were used to assess the HRQOL and adaptive functioning, respectively.ResultsWe recruited 24 children (10 boys, mean age 7y 5 m). Six types of movement disorders were recognised by the expert panel, most frequently dystonia (16/24), myoclonus (7/24) and ataxia (6/24). Mean HRQOL (49.63, SD 21.78) was significantly lower than for other chronic disorders in childhood (e.g. malignancy, diabetes mellitus, rheumatic disease, psychiatric disorders; p <0.001) and tended to diminish with the severity of the movement disorder. The majority of participants had delayed adaptive functioning, most evident in their activities of daily living (51.92%, SD 27.34). Delay in adaptive functioning had a significant impact upon HRQOL (p = 0.018).ConclusionsA broad spectrum of movement disorders was seen in patients with IEM, although only five were receiving treatment. The overall HRQOL in this population is significantly reduced. Delay in adaptive functioning, most frequently seen in relation to activities of daily living, and the severity of the movement disorder contribute to this lower HRQOL.

By analysis of more than 600 metabolites in the Oat3KO (Oat3 knockout) by LC/MS, we demonstrate OAT3 involvement in the movement of gut microbiome products, key metabolites, and signaling molecules, including those flowing through the gut–liver–kidney axis. Major pathways affected included those involved in metabolism of bile acids, flavonoids, nutrients, amino acids (including tryptophan-derivatives that are uremic toxins), and lipids. OAT3 is also critical in elimination of liver-derived phase II metabolites, particularly those undergoing glucuronidation. Analysis of physicochemical features revealed nine distinct metabolite groups; at least one member of most clusters has been previously validated in transport assays. In contrast to drugs interacting with the OATs, endogenous metabolites accumulating in the Oat1KO (Oat1 knockout) versus Oat3KO have distinct differences in their physicochemical properties; they are very different in size, number of rings, hydrophobicity, and molecular complexity. Consistent with the Remote Sensing and Signaling Hypothesis, the data support the importance of the OAT transporters in inter-organ and inter-organismal remote communication via transporter-mediated movement of key metabolites and signaling molecules (e.g. gut microbiome–to–intestine–to–blood–to–liver–to–kidney–to–urine). We discuss the possibility of an intimate connection between OATs and metabolite sensing and signaling pathways (e.g. bile acids). Furthermore, the metabolomics and pathway analysis support the view that OAT1 plays a greater role in kidney proximal tubule metabolism and OAT3 appears relatively more important in systemic metabolism, modulating levels of metabolites flowing through intestine, liver, and kidney.Keywords: drug transport, kidney, multidrug transporter, renal physiology, xenobiotic, OAT3, kidney drug transport, organic anion, solute carrier, uremic toxin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5612110/,abstract

We studied 80 obese children before and after a one-year lifestyle intervention programme inducing substantial weight loss >0.5 BMI standard deviation scores in 40 children and no weight loss in another 40 children. At baseline and after the 1-year intervention, we assessed insulin resistance (HOMA index), fasting glucose, HbA1c, 2 h glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test, AA, and Carn. BMI adjusted metabolite levels were associated with clinical markers at baseline and after intervention, and changes with the intervention period were evaluated. Only tyrosine was significantly associated with HOMA (p < 0.05) at baseline and end and with change during the intervention (p < 0.05). In contrast, ratios depicting BCAA metabolism were negatively associated with HOMA at baseline (p < 0.05), but not in the longitudinal profiling.

Dried blood spots samples (DBSS) belonging to 521 patients with MS were identified in the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank. For every patient with MS, 1–2 controls with the same sex and birth date were retrieved from the Biobank (n = 972). Level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in the DBSS was measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy. The association between different levels of 25(OH)D and risk of MS was evaluated by odds ratios (OR) calculated in conditional logistic regression models.Results: We observed that lower levels of 25(OH)D in neonates were associated with an increased risk of MS. In the analysis by quintiles, MS risk was highest among individuals in the bottom quintile (<20.7 nmol/L) and lowest among those in the top quintile of 25(OH)D (≥48.9 nmol/L), with an OR for top vs bottom of 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36–0.78). In the analysis treating 25(OH)D as a continuous variable, a 25 nmol/L increase in neonatal 25(OH)D resulted in a 30% reduced risk of MS (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57–0.84).Conclusion: Low concentrations of neonatal vitamin D are associated with an increased risk of MS.

Biomarkers do not only give us a better understanding of pathogenesis, but also increase treatment efficacy and safety, further enabling more precise clinical care. This paper focuses on the current use of biomarkers in atopic dermatitis, new developments and future perspectives. Biomarkers can be used for many different purposes, including the objective determination of disease severity, confirmation of clinical diagnosis, and to predict response to treatment. In atopic dermatitis, many biomarkers have been investigated as a marker for disease severity. Currently serum thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) is the superior biomarker for assessing disease severity. However, we have recently shown that the use of a panel of serum biomarkers is more suitable for assessing disease severity than an individual biomarker. In this overview, we will discuss alternative sources for biomarkers, such as saliva and capillary blood, which can increase the user friendliness of biomarkers in atopic dermatitis (AD). Both methods offer simple, non-invasive and cost effective alternatives to venous blood. This provides great translational and clinical potential.

If so, the public health challenge in relation to sugar-sweetened beverages may have less to do with regulating the market and more to do with harnessing it. Contrary to assertions that consumers fail to appreciate the links between their choice of beverage and its health consequences, the health conscious consumer appears to be driving the changes taking place in the beverage market. With the capacity to meet consumer expectations for convenience and indulgence without unwanted kilojoules, drinks containing non-nutritive sweeteners enable the “small change” in health behaviour that individuals are willing to consider.

New biochemical screening technologies led to expansions of NBS programs in the first decade of the 21st century. It is expected that they will in time be replaced by genetic sequencing technologies. These developments have raised a lot of ethical debate. We reviewed the ethical literature on NBS, analyzed the issues and values that emerged, and paid particular interest to the type of impacts authors think NBS should have on the lives of children and their families. Our review shows that most authors keep their ethical reflection confined to policy decisions, about for instance (a) the purpose of the program, and (b) its voluntary or mandatory nature. While some authors show appreciation of how NBS information empowers parents to care for their (diseased) children, most authors consider these aspects to be ‘private’ and leave their evaluation up to parents themselves. While this division of moral labor fits with the liberal conviction to leave individuals free to decide how they want to live their private lives, it also silences the ethical debate about these issues.

Carrier screening is defined here as the detection of carrier status of recessive diseases in couples or persons who do not have an a priori increased risk of being a carrier based on their or their partners' personal or family history. Expanded carrier screening offers carrier screening for multiple autosomal and X-linked recessive disorders, facilitated by new genetic testing technologies, and allows testing of individuals regardless of ancestry or geographic origin. Carrier screening aims to identify couples who have an increased risk of having an affected child in order to facilitate informed reproductive decision making. In previous decades, carrier screening was typically performed for one or few relatively common recessive disorders associated with significant morbidity, reduced life-expectancy and often because of a considerable higher carrier frequency in a specific population for certain diseases. New genetic testing technologies enable the expansion of screening to multiple conditions, genes or sequence variants.

The phenylketonuria – quality of life (PKU-QOL) questionnaire was the first self-administered disease-specific instrument developed to assess the impact of PKU and its treatment on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of patients and their caregivers. Available in four versions (child, adolescent, adult and parent), the PKU-QOL was simultaneously developed and validated in seven countries [i.e., France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom (UK)]. The objectives of our study were to develop and linguistically validate the PKU-QOL questionnaire for use in the United States (US).MethodsThe UK versions served as a basis for the development of the US English PKU-QOL questionnaire. The linguistic validation process consisted of 4 steps: 1) adaptation of the UK versions into US English by a translator native of US English and living in the US; 2) a clinician review; 3) cognitive interviews with patients and caregivers to test the appropriateness, understandability and clarity of the US translations; and 4) two proof-readings.ResultsThe adaptation from UK to US English revealed the usual syntactic and idiomatic differences between the two languages, such as differences in: 1) Spelling, e.g., “dietician” (UK) vs. “dietitian” (US), or “mum” (UK) vs. “mom” (US); 2) Syntax or punctuation; and 3) Words/expressions use, e.g., “holidays” (UK) vs. “vacation” (US), or “biscuits” (UK) vs. “crackers” (US). The major issue was cultural, and consisted of using a different terminology to describe PKU treatment throughout the questionnaires. The clinician, with the patients and the caregivers, during the interviews suggested to replace “supplement and amino-acid mixture” or “supplements” with “medical formula.” This wording was later changed to “medical food” to be consistent with the terminology used in current US published guidelines.ConclusionsThe translation of the UK English PKU-QOL questionnaire into US English did not raise critical semantic and cultural issues. The PKU-QOL will be valuable for US healthcare providers in individualizing treatment and managing patients with PKU.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, PKU-QOL questionnaire, Health-related quality of life, Translation, Linguistic validation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5343404/,abstract

No patient-reported outcome (PRO) HRQoL measure has been validated for use in an AL amyloidosis patient population, leaving a gap for researchers conducting observational studies and clinical trials for drug development. The SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36) has been the most frequently used PRO in AL amyloidosis studies to date, and early qualitative validation studies support its use in this population. The aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the SF-36 among patients with AL amyloidosis.MethodsData from community-based (n=341) and clinic-based (n=1,438) observational studies were used to document the psychometric properties of the SF-36 in this disease population. Reliability was estimated using internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation). Convergent validity, known-groups validity, and the ability to detect change were assessed with available criterion variables.ResultsScale reliability (Cronbach’s alpha ≥0.780 for all scores) and test–retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients ≥0.731 for all) were acceptable. Scale convergent validity was supported by strong correlations with conceptually related measures. Mean SF-36 scores varied by response to treatment (P<0.05 for all scores) and a self-reported measure of disease severity (P<0.001 for all scores). Data indicate that the SF-36 is sensitive to changes in other measures over time.ConclusionThis study provided clear and consistent evidence of the psychometric properties of the SF-36 in both community-based and clinic-based samples of patients with AL amyloidosis.Keywords: patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, psychometric properties",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5724409/,abstract

The pathophysiological bases of ASD have not been defined yet. Many factors seem to be involved in the onset of this disorder. These include genetic and environmental factors, but autism is not linked to a single origin, only. Autism onset can be connected with various factors such as metabolic disorders: including carnitine deficiency. Carnitine is a derivative of two amino acid lysine and methionine. Carnitine is a cofactor for a large family of enzymes: the carnitine acyltransferases. Through their action these enzymes (and L-carnitine) are involved in energy production and metabolic homeostasis. Some people with autism (less than 20%) seem to have L-carnitine metabolism disorders and for these patients, a dietary supplementation with L-carnitine is beneficial.

The questionnaire was designed to assess the characteristics regarding PKU management in three main areas: nation-wide characteristics, PKU screening, and characteristics of the PKU management in the responding centre. It consisted of 56 questions. The distribution and collection of the questionnaires (via e-mail) was taking place from December 2013 to March 2014.ResultsResponses from participants from 11 countries were included; the countries cumulative population is approx. 52.5 mio. PKU screening was not yet introduced in 4 of 11 countries. Reported PKU incidences ranged from 1/7325 to 1/39338 (and were not known for 5 countries). National PKU guidelines existed in 5 of 11 countries and 7 of 11 countries had PKU registry (registries included 40 to 194 patients). The number of PKU centers in each country varied from 1 to 6. Routine genetic diagnostics was reported in 4 of 11 countries. Most commonly used laboratory method to assess phenylalanine levels was fluorometric. Tetrahydrobiopterine was used in only 2 of 11 countries. Most frequently, pediatricians were caring for the patients. Dietitian was a member of PKU team in only 4 of 11 countries, while regular psychological assessments were performed in 6 of 11 countries. Patient’s PKU society existed in 7 of 11 countries.ConclusionsThe region of southeastern Europe was facing certain important challenges of PKU screening and management. Neonatal PKU screening should be introduced throughout the region.

1029,10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.10.003,26602589,"Go to:AbstractAlthough schizophrenia is defined by waking phenomena, abnormal sleep is a common feature. In particular, there is accumulating evidence of a sleep spindle deficit. Sleep spindles, a defining thalamocortical oscillation of non-rapid eye movement Stage 2 sleep, correlate with IQ and are thought to promote long-term potentiation and enhance memory consolidation. Here we review evidence that reduced spindle activity in schizophrenia is an endophenotype that impairs sleep-dependent memory consolidation, contributes to symptoms and is a novel treatment biomarker. Studies showing that spindles can be pharmacologically enhanced in schizophrenia and that increasing spindles improves memory in healthy individuals suggest that treating spindle deficits in schizophrenia may improve cognition. Spindle activity is highly heritable and recent large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified schizophrenia risk genes that may contribute to spindle deficits and illuminate their mechanisms. For example, the schizophrenia risk gene CACNA1I encodes a calcium channel that is abundantly expressed in the thalamic spindle generator and plays a critical role in spindle activity in a mouse knockout. Future genetic studies of animals and humans can delineate the role of this and other genes in spindles. Such cross-disciplinary research, by forging empirical links in causal chains from risk genes to proteins and cellular functions, through to endophenotypes, cognitive impairments, symptoms and diagnosis, has the potential to advance the mechanistic understanding, treatment and prevention of schizophrenia. This review highlights the importance of deficient sleep-dependent memory consolidation among the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia and implicates reduced sleep spindles as a potentially treatable mechanism.Keywords: schizophrenia, sleep, spindles, memory, cognition, genetics, endophenotype",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4833702/,abstract
1031,10.7717/peerj.5410,30186675,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundMetabolic syndrome (MS) is a construct used to separate “healthy” from “unhealthy” obese patients, and is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. There is controversy over whether obese “metabolically well” persons have a higher morbidity and mortality than lean counterparts, suggesting that MS criteria do not completely describe physiologic risk factors or consequences of obesity. We hypothesized that metabolomic analysis of plasma would distinguish obese individuals with and without MS and T2D along a spectrum of obesity-associated metabolic derangements, supporting metabolomic analysis as a tool for a more detailed assessment of metabolic wellness than currently used MS criteria.MethodsFasting plasma samples from 90 adults were assigned to groups based on BMI and ATP III criteria for MS: (1) lean metabolically well (LMW; n = 24); (2) obese metabolically well (OBMW; n = 26); (3) obese metabolically unwell (OBMUW; n = 20); and (4) obese metabolically unwell with T2D (OBDM; n = 20). Forty-one amino acids/dipeptides, 33 acylcarnitines and 21 ratios were measured. Obesity and T2D effects were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests comparing obese nondiabetics vs LMW, and OBDM vs nondiabetics, respectively. Metabolic unwellness was analyzed by Jonckheere-Terpstra trend tests, assuming worsening health from LMW → OBMW → OBMUW. To adjust for multiple comparisons, statistical significance was set at p < 0.005. K-means cluster analysis of aggregated amino acid and acylcarnitine data was also performed.ResultsAnalytes and ratios significantly increasing in obesity, T2D, and with worsening health include: branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), cystine, alpha-aminoadipic acid, phenylalanine, leucine + lysine, and short-chain acylcarnitines/total carnitines. Tyrosine, alanine and propionylcarnitine increase with obesity and metabolic unwellness. Asparagine and the tryptophan/large neutral amino acid ratio decrease with T2D and metabolic unwellness. Malonylcarnitine decreases in obesity and 3-OHbutyrylcarnitine increases in T2D; neither correlates with unwellness. Cluster analysis did not separate subjects into discreet groups based on metabolic wellness.DiscussionLevels of 15 species and metabolite ratios trend significantly with worsening metabolic health; some are newly recognized. BCAAs, aromatic amino acids, lysine, and its metabolite, alpha-aminoadipate, increase with worsening health. The lysine pathway is distinct from BCAA metabolism, indicating that biochemical derangements associated with MS involve pathways besides those affected by BCAAs. Even those considered “obese, metabolically well” had metabolite levels which significantly trended towards those found in obese diabetics. Overall, this analysis yields a more granular view of metabolic wellness than the sole use of cardiometabolic MS parameters. This, in turn, suggests the possible utility of plasma metabolomic analysis for research and public health applications.Keywords: Metabolomic, Metabolomics, Obesity, Metabolic syndrome, Metabolic wellness, Type 2 diabetes, Amino acids, Acylcarnitines",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6120443/,abstract

Here we describe a novel, versatile and simple PCR-RFLP procedure baptised ‘derived Polymorphic Amplified Cleaved Sequence’ (dPACS) for genotyping individual samples. The notable advantage of the method is that it employs a pair of primers that cover the entire fragment to be amplified except for one or few diagnostic bases around the SNP/DIP being investigated. As such, it provides greater opportunities to introduce mismatches in one or both of the 35–55 bp primers for creating a restriction site that unambiguously differentiates wild from mutant sequences following PCR-RFLP and horizontal MetaPhorTM gel electrophoresis. Selection of effective restriction enzymes and primers is aided by the newly developed dPACS 1.0 software. The highly transferable dPACS procedure is exemplified here with the positive detection (in up to 24 grass and broadleaf species tested) of wild type proline106 of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase and its serine, threonine and alanine variants that confer resistance to glyphosate, and serine264 and isoleucine2041 which are key target-site determinants for weed sensitivities to some photosystem II and acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibiting herbicides, respectively.Keywords: dPACS, PCR-RFLP, SNP, genotyping, herbicide resistance, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), photosystem II, EPSPS",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6651057/,abstract

As infection in pregnant women is usually symptomless, the diagnosis relies only on serological tests. Some countries like France and Austria have organized a regular serological testing of pregnant women, some others have no prenatal program of surveillance. Reasons for these discrepant attitudes are many and debatable. Among them are the efficacy of antenatal treatment and cost-effectiveness of such a program. A significant body of data demonstrated that rapid onset of treatment after maternal infection reduces the risk and severity of fetal infection. Recent cost-effectiveness studies support regular screening. This lack of consensus put both pregnant women and care providers in a difficult situation. Another reason why congenital toxoplasmosis is disregarded in some countries is the lack of precise information about its impact on the population. Precise estimations on the burden of the disease can be achieved by systematic screening that will avoid bias or underreporting of cases and provide a clear view of its outcome.Keywords: congenital toxoplasmosis, mass screening, antenatal treatment efficacy, cost effectiveness",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5874751/,abstract

The physiological function of GPR139 remains elusive despite the availability of pharmacological tool agonist compounds and knock-out mice. Whole tissue RNA sequencing data from human, mouse and rat tissues revealed that GPR139 and the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) exhibited some similarities in their distribution patterns in the brain and pituitary gland. To determine if there was true co-expression of these two receptors, we applied double in situ hybridization in mouse tissues using the RNAscope® technique. GPR139 and DRD2 mRNA co-expressed in a majority of same cells within part of the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathways (ventral tegmental area and olfactory tubercle), the nigrostriatal pathway (compact part of substantia nigra and caudate putamen), and also the tuberoinfundibular pathway (arcuate hypothalamic nucleus and anterior lobe of pituitary). Both receptors mRNA also co-express in the same cells of the brain regions involved in responses to negative stimulus and stress, such as lateral habenula, lateral septum, interpeduncular nucleus, and medial raphe nuclei. GPR139 mRNA expression was detected in the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus as well as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. The functional interaction between GPR139 and DRD2 was studied in vitro using a calcium mobilization assay in cells co-transfected with both receptors from several species (human, rat, and mouse). The dopamine DRD2 agonist did not stimulate calcium response in cells expressing DRD2 alone consistent with the Gi signaling transduction pathway of this receptor. In cells co-transfected with DRD2 and GPR139 the DRD2 agonist was able to stimulate calcium response and its effect was blocked by either a DRD2 or a GPR139 antagonist supporting an in vitro interaction between GPR139 and DRD2. Taken together, these data showed that GPR139 and DRD2 are in position to functionally interact in native tissue.Keywords: GPR139, dopamine D2 receptor, co-expression, in situ hybridization, in vitro interaction, calcium mobilization",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6443882/,abstract

Age, sex, plasma phenylalanine (Phe) level, DASS (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales) depression score, DASS anxiety score, BMI, salivary serotonin, salivary cortisol, 2-year average Phe, 2-year average tyrosine (Tyr), and 2-year average Phe:Tyr ratio were collected for each patient. Spearman's ρ correlation analysis was used to determine if there was any relationship between any of the parameters.ResultsThere were positive correlations between DASS anxiety and DASS depression scores (Spearman's ρ = 0.8708, p-value < 0.0001), BMI and plasma Phe level (Spearman's ρ = 0.6228, p-value = .0034), and 2-year average Phe and BMI (Spearman's ρ = 0.5448, p-value = .0130).

Eighteen children with severe CH and 21 healthy controls underwent a battery of behavioral measures of hearing, language and communication, along with diffusion MR imaging. Tract-based spatial statistics were performed on standard diffusion parameters of fractional anisotropy and diffusivity metrics. Microscopic diffusion anisotropy mapping based on the Spherical Mean Technique was also used to evaluate biologically specific metrics. Compared with age-matched controls, children with severe CH had poorer hearing and communication skills, albeit generally within normal limits. Children with severe CH had fractional anisotropy that was significantly lower in the cerebellum, bilateral thalami and right temporal lobe, and radial diffusivity that was significantly higher in the cerebellum and bilateral thalami. Microscopic fractional anisotropy and intra-neurite volume fraction were also significantly decreased, and transverse microscopic diffusivity was significantly increased, in the CH group in areas including the cerebellum, thalamus, occipital lobe, and corpus callosum, and in the white matter adjacent to sensorimotor cortex, particularly in the left hemisphere. Significant and widespread correlations were observed between behavioral measures and measures of white matter microstructural integrity in children with CH.

1038,10.3892/ijmm.2016.2461,26797017,"Go to:AbstractAcute liver failure, i.e., the fatal deterioration of liver function, is the most common indication that emergency liver transplantation is necessary. Moreover, in the USA, drug-induced liver injury (DILI), including acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity, is the main cause of acute liver failure. Matching a donor for liver transplantation is extremely difficult, and thus the development of a novel therapy for DILI is urgently needed. Following recent approval by the FDA of the proteasomal inhibitor bortezomib, its therapeutic effects on various human diseases, including solid and hematologic malignancies, have been validated. However, the specific action of proteasomal inhibition in cases of DILI had not been elucidated prior to this study. To examine the effects of proteasomal inhibition in DILI experimentally, male C56Bl/6 mice were injected with 1 mg bortezomib/kg before APAP treatment. Bortezomib not only alleviated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in a time- and dose-dependent manner, it also alleviated CCl4- and thioacetamide-induced hepatotoxicity. We also noted that bortezomib significantly reduced cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) expression and activity in the liver, which was accompanied by the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In addition, bortezomib decreased hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α-induced promoter activation of CYP2E1 in Hep3B cells. By contrast, another proteasome inhibitor, MG132, did not cause ER stress and did not markedly affect CYP2E1 enzyme activity. Liver injury induced by APAP was aggravated by MG132, possibly via elevation of connexin 32 expression. This study suggests that proteasome inhibition has different effects in cases of DILI depending on the specific inhibitor being used. Furthermore, results from the mouse model indicated that bortezomib, but not MG132, was effective in alleviating DILI. ER stress induced by proteasome inhibition has previously been shown to exert various effects on DILI patients, and thus each available proteasomal inhibitor should be evaluated individually in order to determine its potential for clinical application.Keywords: bortezomib, liver, cytochrome P450 2E1, toxicity, acetaminophen, proteasome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4771096/,abstract

of different conditions and significant total number of affected patients. The
study of these disorders is extremely helpful for the elucidation of
physiological processes related with complex disorders. Isolated populations are
instrumental for the study of genetic disorders, considering their homogeneity
and high proportion of affected patients in a small geographic area. These
favorable conditions lead to the creation of a new discipline, known as
“population medical genetics”, which integrates medical genetics, population
genetics, epidemiological genetics and community genetics. In order to develop
practical activities in this new discipline, the National Institute of
Population Medical Genetics (INaGeMP) was created in 2008 in Brazil. INaGeMP has
developed several tools and funded numerous research activities. In this review,
we highlight three successful projects developed in the first 10 years of
INaGeMP activities (2008-2018): a newborn screening pilot study for MPS VI in
Northeast Brazil, the study of Machado-Joseph disease in Brazilian families with
Azorian ancestry, and the high twinning rate in a small town in southern Brazil.

We investigated genetic associations with reflexive attention measures in infancy and childhood in the same group of children. The genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms and variable number tandem repeats on the genes APOE, BDNF, CHRNA4, COMT, DRD4, HTR4, IGF2, MAOA, SLC5A7, SLC6A3, and SNAP25) are related to brain development and/or to the availability of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, or serotonin. This study shows that typically developing children have differences in reflexive attention associated with their genes, as we found in adults (Lundwall, Guo, & Dannemiller, 2012). This effort to extend our previous findings to outcomes in infancy and childhood was necessary because genetic influence may differ over the course of development. Although two of the genes that were tested in our adult study (Lundwall et al., 2012) were significant in either our infant study (SLC6A3) or child study (DRD4), the specific markers tested differed. Performance on the infant task was associated with SLC6A3. In addition, several genetic associations with an analogous child task occurred with markers on CHRNA4, COMT, and DRD4. Interestingly, the child version of the task involved an interaction such that which genotype group performed poorer on the child task depended on whether we were examining the higher or lower infant scoring group.

Parents completed questionnaires of psychosocial and family functioning at one-month and one-year following diagnosis. Chart review and questionnaires were used to collect medical variables and seizure outcomes. Previously established two-year AED adherence trajectories (Severe Early Non-Adherence, Variable Non-Adherence, Moderate Non-Adherence, High Adherence) were used as the outcome variable.ResultsParticipants were 91 parents of youth with epilepsy (7.3 ± 2.8 years of age; 60% male) and their families. Early (one-month following diagnosis) predictors of two-year adherence trajectories included socioeconomic status, epilepsy knowledge, family problem-solving, and family communication. Significant predictors one-year following diagnosis included socioeconomic status, parent fears and concerns, and parent life stress.ConclusionThere are modifiable parent and family variables that predict two-year adherence trajectories above and beyond known medical (e.g., seizures, side effects) factors.

There have been some bottlenecks such as false-positives and imprecision in the current NBS tests. To overcome these issues, we developed a multigene panel for IMD testing and investigated the utility of our integrated screening model in a routine NBS environment. We also evaluated the genetic epidemiologic characteristics of IMDs in a Korean population.MethodsIn total, 269 dried blood spots with positive results from current NBS tests were collected from 120,700 consecutive newborns. We screened 97 genes related to NBS in Korea and detected IMDs, using an integrated screening model based on biochemical tests and next-generation sequencing (NGS) called NewbornSeq. Haplotype analysis was conducted to detect founder effects.ResultsThe overall positive rate of IMDs was 20%. We identified 10 additional newborns with preventable IMDs that would not have been detected prior to the implementation of our NGS-based platform NewbornSeq. The incidence of IMDs was approximately 1 in 2,235 births. Haplotype analysis demonstrated founder effects in p.Y138X in DUOXA2, p.R885Q in DUOX2, p.Y439C in PCCB, p.R285Pfs*2 in SLC25A13, and p.R224Q in GALT.ConclusionsThrough a population-based study in the NBS environment, we highlight the screening and epidemiological implications of NGS.

The study objectives were to: 1) identify the number of SLPF available for use in eight European countries and Turkey and 2) analyse the nutritional composition of SLPF available in one of these countries.MethodsEuropean Nutritionist Expert Panel on PKU (ENEP) members (Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, UK, Denmark and Turkey) provided data on SPLF available in each country. The nutritional composition of Portuguese SLPF was compared with regular food products.ResultsThe number of different SLPF available in each country varied widely with a median of 107 [ranging from 73 (Portugal) and 256 (Italy)]. Food analysis of SLPF available from a single country (Portugal) indicated that the mean phenylalanine content was higher in low protein baby cereals (mean 48 mg/100 g) and chocolate/energy bars/jelly (mean 41 mg/100 g). The energy content of different foods from a sub-group of SLPF (cookies) varied widely between 23 and 96 kcal/cookie. Low protein bread had a high fat content [mean 5.8 g/100 g (range 3.7 to 10)] compared with 1.6 g/100 g in regular bread. Seven of the 12 SLPF sub-groups (58 %) did not declare any vitamin content, and only 4 (33 %) identified a limited number of minerals.ConclusionsWhilst equal and free access to all SLPF is desirable, the widely variable nutritional composition requires careful nutritional knowledge of all products when prescribed for individual patients with PKU.

This study aimed to quantify the burden of AL amyloidosis in terms of health-related quality of life in a diverse, community-based sample of AL amyloidosis patients.ResultsThe SF-36v2® Health Survey (SF-36v2), a widely used generic measure of health-related quality of life (using physical and mental summary scales and subscales assessing eight aspects of functioning and well-being), was administered as an online survey of AL amyloidosis patients with AL amyloidosis (ClinicalTrials.gov, {""type"":""clinical-trial"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NCT02574676"",""term_id"":""NCT02574676""}}NCT02574676; n = 341). Compared with adjusted general population sample norms, health-related quality of life of AL amyloidosis patients was significantly worse across all SF-36v2 scales and summary measures based on analysis of variance (p < 0.05 for all). The largest decrement in AL amyloidosis patients was related to General Health (Δ = 9.7; p < 0.001). With the exception of Bodily Pain and Mental Health, differences were also clinically meaningful based on established clinically minimal important differences. The burden of AL amyloidosis overall and in key subgroups tended to be greater on physical health than on mental health. Stratified analyses indicated additional burden among patients with recently diagnosed disease and those with cardiac involvement than among their respective counterparts.ConclusionUnderstanding the burden of AL amyloidosis highlights the unmet need for treatment, helps physicians identify ancillary treatments and services geared towards improving patients’ functioning, well-being, and overall health-related quality of life.

Each year, around 10,000 parents of babies born in England are given a positive NBS result indicating their child may be affected or carriers of one of the nine conditions currently screened for. Despite guidance, these results are inconsistently delivered to parents across geographical regions. There is evidence that many parents are dissatisfied with how NBS results are communicated to them and that poor communication practices can lead to various negative sequelae. The purpose of this study is to co-design, implement and undertake a process evaluation of new, co-designed interventions to improve delivery of initial positive NBS results to parents.MethodsThis mixed-methods study will use four phases with defined outputs. Family Systems Theory will form the theoretical basis for the study. The principles and methods of experience-based co-design will underpin intervention development. Normalisation Process Theory will underpin the process evaluation of the interventions co-designed to improve the delivery of positive NBS results to parents. An economic analysis will determine resource use and costs of current practice and of implementing the new co-designed interventions. The nominal group technique will be used to inform the selection of suitable outcome measures for a future evaluation study.DiscussionThe main output of the proposed study will be co-designed interventions for initial communication of positive NBS results to parents ready to be evaluated in a definitive evaluation study.The interventions, co-designed with parents, will help to minimise potential negative sequelae associated with poor communication practices by considering parental and staff experiences as well as healthcare challenges such as finite resources. In addition, information about indicative costs associated with different communication strategies will be determined.It is anticipated it may also be possible to extrapolate principles of good communication practices from the present study for the delivery of bad news to parents for children newly diagnosed with other conditions including cancer and other chronic conditions such as diabetes or epilepsy.Trial registrationISRCTN 15330120 date of registration 17/01/2018Keywords: Newborn bloodspot screening, Cystic fibrosis, Sickle cell disease, Metabolic, Congenital hypothyroid",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6724281/,abstract

However, SSBs have a high content of fructose, the consumption of which acutely fails to trigger responses in key signals involved in energy homeostasis. It is unclear whether the fructose content of SSBs contributes to the increased energy intake in individuals drinking SSBs.Objective: We investigated whether the relative amounts of fructose and glucose in SSBs modifies ad libitum energy intake over 8 d in healthy adults without fructose malabsorption.Design: We conducted 2 randomized, controlled, double-blind crossover studies to compare the effects of consuming 4 servings/d of a fructose-, glucose-, or aspartame-sweetened beverage (study A; n = 9) or a fructose-, glucose-, or high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)–sweetened beverage (study B; n = 24) for 8 d on overall energy intake. SSBs were provided at 25% of estimated energy requirement, or an equivalent volume of the aspartame-sweetened beverage, and consumption was mandatory. All solid foods were provided at 125% of estimated energy requirements and were consumed ad libitum.Results: In study A, ad libitum energy intake was 120% ± 10%, 117% ± 12%, and 102% ± 15% of estimated energy requirements when subjects consumed the fructose-, glucose-, and aspartame-sweetened beverages. Energy intake was significantly higher in the fructose and glucose phases than in the aspartame phase (P < 0.003 for each), with no difference between the fructose and glucose phases (P = 0.462). In study B, total energy intake during the fructose, HFCS, and glucose phases was 116% ± 14%, 116% ± 16%, and 116% ± 16% of the subject’s estimated total energy requirements (P = 0.880).Conclusions: In healthy adults, total 8-d ad libitum energy intake was increased in individuals consuming SSBs compared with aspartame-sweetened beverages.

Here we attempt to clarify the issue, and offer a solution to this paradox that has been frequently overlooked: Intelligence is a trait with unusual properties that create a large reservoir of hidden Gene-Environment (GE) networks, allowing for the contribution of high genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in IQ. GE interplay (consisting of both interactions and correlations between genes and environment) is difficult to specify with current methods, and is underestimated in standard metrics of heritability (thus inflating estimates of “genetic” effects). We describe empirical evidence for GE interplay in intelligence, with malleability of intelligence existing on top of heritability. The evidence covers IQ gains consequent to adoption/immigration, changes in heritability across lifespan and socio-economic status, gains in IQ over time consequent to societal development (the Flynn effect), the slowdown of age-related cognitive declines, and IQ gains via early education. The GE solution has novel implications for enduring problems including our inability to identify intelligence-related genes (also known as IQ’s “missing heritability”), and the dissipation of initial benefits from early intervention programs (e.g., “Head Start”). The GE solution can be a powerful guide to future research, and may also aid in the implementation of policies to overcome barriers to the development of intelligence, particularly in impoverished and under-privileged populations.Keywords: Intelligence, Heritability, Gene-environment interplay, Adoption, Early intervention",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5754247/,abstract

Herein, we characterize the maternal urinary metabolome throughout pregnancy to identify maternal metabolic signatures of fetal growth in two subcohorts and explain potential sources of variation in metabolic profiles based on lifestyle and clinical data.MethodsWe used 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize maternal urine samples collected in the INMA birth cohort at the first (n = 412 and n = 394, respectively, in Gipuzkoa and Sabadell cohorts) and third trimesters of gestation (n = 417 and 469). Metabolic phenotypes that reflected longitudinal intra- and inter-individual variation were used to predict measures of fetal growth and birth weight.ResultsA metabolic shift between the first and third trimesters of gestation was characterized by 1H NMR signals arising predominantly from steroid by-products. We identified 10 significant and reproducible metabolic associations in the third trimester with estimated fetal, birth, and placental weight in two independent subcohorts. These included branched-chain amino acids; isoleucine, valine, leucine, alanine and 3 hydroxyisobutyrate (metabolite of valine), which were associated with a significant fetal weight increase at week 34 of up to 2.4 % in Gipuzkoa (P < 0.005) and 1 % in Sabadell (P < 0.05). Other metabolites included pregnancy-related hormone by-products of estrogens and progesterone, and the methyl donor choline. We could explain a total of 48–53 % of the total variance in birth weight of which urine metabolites had an independent predictive power of 12 % adjusting for all other lifestyle/clinical factors. First trimester metabolic phenotypes could not predict reproducibly weight at later stages of development. Physical activity, as well as other modifiable lifestyle/clinical factors, such as coffee consumption, vitamin D intake, and smoking, were identified as potential sources of metabolic variation during pregnancy.ConclusionsSignificant reproducible maternal urinary metabolic signatures of fetal growth and birth weight are identified for the first time and linked to modifiable lifestyle factors.

Given complexity of human phenotypes, much work is required. In this review, we deconstruct this challenge at a high level to define what is needed to move closer toward these aspirations. In the context of the variables that influence the diverse array of phenotypes across human health and disease – genetics, epigenetics, environmental influences, and the microbiome – we detail the factors behind why an individual's biochemical (metabolite) composition is increasingly regarded as a key element to precisely defining phenotypes. Although an individual's biochemical (metabolite) composition is generally regarded, and frequently shown, to be a surrogate to the phenotypic state, we review how metabolites (and therefore an individual's metabolic profile) are also functionally related to the myriad of phenotypic influencers like genetics and the microbiota. We describe how using the technology to comprehensively measure an individual's biochemical profile – metabolomics – is integrative to defining individual phenotypes and how it is currently being deployed in efforts to continue to elaborate on human health and disease in large population studies. Finally, we summarize instances where metabolomics is being used to assess individual health in instances where signatures (i.e. biomarkers) have been defined.Keywords: Precision Medicine, Metabolomics, Inborn Errors of Metabolism, Mass Spectrometry, Genome Wide Association Study, Untargeted Analysis, Diagnostics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4744241/,abstract

The current study aimed to estimate mean IQ with the Wechsler scale in Iran by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. In the current meta-analysis, all articles related to IQ conducted in Iran using the Wechsler scale were deeply searched by reviewing citation databases including Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Springer, SID, Magiran, Iranmedex, Medlib, and Google Scholar motor search and using valid keywords without time limits. Due to heterogeneity between studies, a random effects model was used to combine the results of studies. To investigate the heterogeneity of the studies, the I2 index was used. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA software version 11.1. The number of participants in the 51 studies was 5352. The mean total IQ score in Iran was estimated 97.12 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 88.71–105.52), the practical intelligence was 92.84 (95% CI: 79.14–106.55), and the verbal intelligence was 94.50 (95% CI: 83.90–105.10). The total IQ score in the northern, southern, central, eastern, and western regions of Iran was 97.08, 108.90, 92.31, 101.76, and 96.45, respectively. The mean IQ score in Iran in subjects under 20 years of age is 97.73 and in subjects over 20 years of age is 105.61. There is also no significant relationship between the mean total IQ in Iran and two parameters of the year of research and number of research samples. For prevention of decrease IQ and given that proper nutrition and breastfeeding directly contribute to increase IQ, nutrition should be provided free of charge in poorer areas during pregnancy until baby born. Moreover, the media should provide adequate education for breastfeeding and nutrition, because IQ affects people's academic, occupational, personal, and social performance, and also prevents elite immigration with suitable planning and provides conditions for elites to return to the country.Keywords: Iran, intelligence quotient, meta-analysis, practical intelligence, verbal intelligence, Wechsler",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6425765/,abstract

Diagnostic cutoff levels enabling identification of newborns with milder and reversible T and/or B cell lymphopenia were also evaluated. Sixty-four children were recalled for follow-up due to low TREC and/or KREC levels, and three patients with immunodeficiency (Artemis-SCID, ATM, and an as yet unclassified T cell lymphopenia/hypogammaglobulinemia) were identified. Of the positive samples, 24 were associated with prematurity. Thirteen children born to mothers treated with immunosuppressive agents during pregnancy (azathioprine (n = 9), mercaptopurine (n = 1), azathioprine and tacrolimus (n = 3)) showed low KREC levels at birth, which spontaneously normalized. Twenty-nine newborns had no apparent cause identified for their abnormal results, but normalized with time. Children with trisomy 21 (n = 43) showed a lower median number of both TREC (104 vs. 174 copies/μL blood) and KREC (45 vs. 100 copies/3.2 mm blood spot), but only one, born prematurely, fell below the cutoff level. Two children diagnosed with DiGeorge syndrome were found to have low TREC levels, but these were still above the cutoff level.

Over the past few decades, the public health community recognized that health risk is driven by interaction between the human genome and external environment. Now that the human genetic code has been sequenced, establishing this “G × E” (gene–environment) interaction requires a similar effort to decode the human exposome, which is the accumulation of an individual’s environmental exposures and metabolic responses throughout the person’s lifetime. The exposome is composed of endogenous and exogenous chemicals, many of which are measurable as biomarkers in blood, breath, and urine. Exposure to pollutants is assessed by analyzing biofluids for the pollutant itself or its metabolic products. New methods are being developed to use a subset of biomarkers, termed bioindicators, to demonstrate biological changes indicative of future adverse health effects. Typically, environmental biomarkers are assessed using noninvasive (excreted) media, such as breath and urine. Blood is often avoided for biomonitoring due to practical reasons such as medical personnel, infectious waste, or clinical setting, despite the fact that blood represents the central compartment that interacts with every living cell and is the most relevant biofluid for certain applications and analyses.

Although nocistatin inhibits some inflammatory pain responses, whether NIPSNAP1 affects inflammatory pain appears to be unclear. Here, we examined the nociceptive behavioral response of NIPSNAP1-deficient mice and the expression of NIPSNAP1 following peripheral inflammation to determine the contribution of NIPSNAP1 to inflammatory pain.ResultsNociceptive behavioral response increased in phase II of the formalin test, particularly during the later stage (26–50 min) in NIPSNAP1-deficient mice, although the response during phase I (0–15 min) was not significantly different between the deficient and wild-type mice. Moreover, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase was enhanced in the spinal dorsal horn of the deficient mice. The prolonged inflammatory pain induced by carrageenan and complete Freund’s adjuvant was exacerbated in NIPSNAP1-deficient mice. NIPSNAP1 mRNA was expressed in small- and medium-sized neurons of the dorsal root ganglion and motor neurons of the spinal cord. In the formalin test, NIPSNAP1 mRNA was slightly increased in dorsal root ganglion but not in the spinal cord. In contrast, NIPSNAP1 mRNA levels in dorsal root ganglion were significantly decreased during 24–48 h after carrageenan injection. Prostaglandin E2, a major mediator of inflammation, stimulated NIPSNAP1 mRNA expression via the cAMP-protein kinase A signaling pathway in isolated dorsal root ganglion cells.ConclusionsThese results suggest that changes in NIPSNAP1 expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory pain.Keywords: NIPSNAP1, inflammatory pain, gene expression, prostaglandin E2",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4956003/,abstract

Multivitamin/multimineral supplements (MVMS) are widely used by this population, which reduces inadequacies in micronutrient intake, but the potential for exceeding tolerable upper intake levels in others should be considered. There are concerns associated with the excessive intake of certain nutrients, particularly folic acid, and potential untoward consequences. The advent of nutrigenomics and the enhanced ability to directly study the interactions between nutrition and genetic variants and expression will allow for the conduct of more targeted studies with specific endpoints and may ultimately lead to progress in the field of personalized nutrition. The role of MVMS in health maintenance and chronic disease prevention remains controversial. Conducting studies in this area has been hampered by, among other factors, inconsistent definitions of MVMS, ranging from as few as three vitamins to broad-spectrum products containing more than two dozen vitamins and minerals. Results from some observational studies and large-scale, randomized, controlled trials suggest that MVMS may reduce the risk of some forms of cancer and, potentially, cardiovascular disease.

New insight into inherited diseases and the ability to test for numerous diseases using new technique such as tandem mass spectrometry have made it practical to greatly expand the number of conditions tested. The expanded neonatal screening is now available and relatively simple, but this represents only a part of the picture. Positive results require follow-up confirmation. Most disorders screened require confirmatory biochemical or genetic tests and specialist visits. An efficient system is needed for managing the care of affected newborns. Expanded newborn screening is not yet available in all Regions of Italy, but discussions aimed at organizing universal access are underway. If these are successful, the role of the pediatrician as the primary contact with the parents is expected to become even more important.MethodsWe have conducted a survey of Italian pediatricians to assess their familiarity and opinions on newborn screening in general and on expanded newborn screening. All members of the Italian Association of Pediatricians (n = 9000) were invited to compile a 10-item questionnaire online.ResultsThe response rate was 10 %, corresponding to 605 of 6000 active members. Respondents were from all Regions of Italy, with the highest number of responses coming from Lombardy (138, 22.8 %), Campania and Puglia (n = 61; 10.1 %). Interestingly, expanded neonatal screening was not available in any of these Regions at the time of the survey. Regarding their understanding of neonatal screening in general, most respondents (n = 552; 91.1 %) considered that they had at least a sufficient level of knowledge; however, only 59.6 % thought they had sufficient knowledge of expanded newborn screening.ConclusionsSuccessful implementation of a universal expanded NBS program will require efficient procedures for follow-up, diagnosis and treatment to prevent morbidity and mortality of infants and to reduce the period of uncertainty for unaffected families.

These drugs are widely prescribed, even during pregnancy considering their minimal extra‐pyramidal side effects and teratogenic potential compared to classical APDs. Among AAPDs, risperidone (RIS) is a first‐line drug of choice by physicians. The molecular weight of RIS is 410.49 g/mol; hence, it can easily cross the placental barrier and enter the foetal bloodstream. It is not known whether or not AAPDs like RIS may affect the developing placenta and foetus adversely. Reports on this issue are limited and sketchy. Therefore, this study has evaluated the effects of maternal exposure to equivalent therapeutic doses of RIS on placental growth, histopathological and cytoarchitectural changes, and to establish a relationship between placental dysfunction and foetal outcomes. Pregnant rats (n = 24) were exposed to selected doses (0.8, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) of RIS from gestation days 6–21. These dams were sacrificed; their placentas and foetuses were collected, morphometrically examined and further processed for histopathological examination. This study revealed that in utero exposure to equivalent therapeutic doses of RIS during organogenesis‐induced placental dystrophy (size and weight), disturbed cytoarchitectural organization (thickness of different placental layers), histopathological lesions (necrosis in trophoblast with disruption of trophoblastic septa and rupturing of maternal‐foetal interface) and intrauterine growth restriction of the foetuses.

Here, we review opportunities for intervention at critical points in developmental trajectories. We begin by discussing potential opportunities to prevent neuropsychiatric disorders. Once symptoms begin to emerge, a number of interventions have been studied either before a diagnosis can be made or shortly after diagnosis. Although some of these interventions are helpful, few are based upon an understanding of pathophysiology, and most ameliorate rather than resolve symptoms. As such, in the next portion of the review, we turn our discussion to genetic syndromes that are rare phenocopies of common diagnoses such as autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia. Cellular or animal models of these syndromes point to specific regulatory or signaling pathways. As examples, findings from the mouse models of Fragile X and Rett syndromes point to potential treatments now being tested in randomized clinical trials. Paralleling oncology, we can hope that our treatments will move from nonspecific, like chemotherapies thrown at a wide range of tumor types, to specific, like the protein kinase inhibitors that target molecularly defined tumors. Some of these targeted treatments later show benefit for a broader, yet specific, array of cancers.

We show here that this peptide lacks the ability to seed aggregation of tau244-372 in cells. However, as the hexapeptide is gradually extended to 31 residues, the peptides aggregate more slowly and gain potent activity to induce aggregation of tau244-372 in cells.

It is required for fibroblast cell survival and maintaining cardiac function. Very little is known about human Gab1 expression in response to chronic hypoxia. The present study examined the hypothesis that hypoxia regulates Gab1 expression in human paediatric myocardium and cultured rat cardiomyocytes. Here we showed that Gab1 is expressed in myocardial tissue in acyanotic and cyanotic children with congenital heart defects. Gab1 protein was upregulated in cyanotic compared to acyanotic hearts suggesting that Gab1 upregulation is a component of the survival program initiated by hypoxia in cyanotic children. The expression of other Gab1 interacting partners was not affected by hypoxia and Gab1 regulation. Additionally, using an in vitro model, we demonstrated that overexpressing Gab1 in neonatal cardiomyocytes, under hypoxic condition, resulted in the reduction of apoptosis suggesting a role for this protein in cardiomyocyte survival. Altogether, our data provide strong evidence that Gab1 is important for heart cell survival following hypoxic stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4452271/,abstract

In addition, assessment of the educational needs of families and providers with regard to the implications of NBS results is required to inform the development of appropriate informational resources and training opportunities. To begin to address these issues, we administered a web-based survey to state NBS coordinators within the Southeast Regional Newborn Screening & Genetics Collaborative (SERC). Fourteen coordinators responded to the survey, including at least one from each of the 10 SERC states/territories. Over one-third of respondents had never received formal training regarding the metabolic conditions identified on NBS. Most communicated results via telephone or fax, though two centers indicated use of a web-based platform. Only two programs were involved in directly reporting results to the family. Four programs reported a long-term follow-up protocol. Deficits were noted for primary care provider (PCP) knowledge of metabolic disorders identified on NBS, and how to inform parents of abnormal results. Close to half indicated that the adequacy of the number of genetic counselors, dietitians, and medical/biochemical geneticists was minimal to insufficient.

We identified cis-regulatory elements for critical genes in epididymis function, by mapping open chromatin genome-wide in human epididymis epithelial (HEE) cells. Bioinformatic predictions of transcription factors binding to the regulatory elements suggested an important role for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) in the transcriptional program of these cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed HNF1 target genes in HEE cells. In parallel, the contribution of HNF1 to the transcriptome of HEE cells was determined by RNA-seq, following siRNA-mediated depletion of both HNF1α and HNF1β transcription factors. Repression of these factors caused differential expression of 1892 transcripts (902 were downregulated and 990 upregulated) in comparison to a non-targeting siRNA. Differentially expressed genes with HNF1 ChIP-seq peaks within 20kb were subject to gene ontology process enrichment analysis. Among the most significant pathways associated with down-regulated genes were epithelial transport of water, phosphate and bicarbonate, all critical processes in epididymis epithelial function.

The therapeutic potential of peripheral 5-HT synthesis inhibitors has been demonstrated in a number of clinical and pre-clinical studies in diseases including carcinoid syndrome, lung fibrosis, ulcerative colitis and obesity. Due to the long half-life of 5-HT in blood and lung, changes in steady-state levels are slow to manifest themselves. Here, the administration of stable isotope labeled tryptophan (heavy “h-Trp”) and resultant in vivo conversion to h-5-HT is used to monitor 5-HT synthesis in rats. Dose responses for the blockade of h-5-HT appearance in blood with the TPH inhibitors L-para-chlorophenylalanine (30 and 100 mg/kg) and telotristat etiprate (6, 20 and 60 mg/kg), demonstrated that the method enables robust quantification of pharmacodynamic effects on a short time-scale, opening the possibility for rapid screening of TPH1 inhibitors in vivo. In the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis rat model, the mechanism of lung 5-HT increase was investigated using a combination of synthesis and steady state 5-HT measurement.

Although triptolide has demonstrated that it could suppress bone destruction in collagen-induced mice, its therapeutic mechanism remains unclear. Many studies have investigated the effect of triptolide on Tregs and Tregs-related cytokine involved in RA. Additionally, previous studies have implied that Tregs inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Thus, in this study we aimed to explore the regulatory mechanism by which triptolide influences the Treg-mediated production of IL-10 and TGF-β1 to affect osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. In cocultures system of Tregs and mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), Tregs inhibited the differentiation of osteoclasts and reduced the resorbed areas significantly and the production of both IL-10 and TGF-β1 was upregulated. When the coculture systems were pretreated with triptolide, they produced higher levels of IL-10 and TGF-β1. Our data indicate that triptolide enhances the suppressive effects of Tregs on osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption by enhancing the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β1. Tregs are most likely involved in the triptolide-mediated regulation of bone metabolism and may provide a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory bone destruction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4930824/,abstract

Whole genome sequence analysis of amino acid levels may establish a paradigm for analyzing quantitative risk factors.ResultsIn a discovery cohort of 1872 African Americans and a replication cohort of 1552 European Americans we sequenced exons and whole genomes and measured serum levels of 70 amino acids. Rare and low-frequency variants (minor allele frequency ≤5%) were analyzed by three types of aggregating motifs defined by gene exons, regulatory regions, or genome-wide sliding windows. Common variants (minor allele frequency >5%) were analyzed individually. Over all four analysis strategies, 14 gene–amino acid associations were identified and replicated. The 14 loci accounted for an average of 1.8% of the variance in amino acid levels, which ranged from 0.4 to 9.7%. Among the identified locus–amino acid pairs, four are novel and six have been reported to underlie known Mendelian conditions. These results suggest that there may be substantial genetic effects on amino acid levels in the general population that may underlie inborn errors of metabolism.

Quantitative data were collected from a cross-sectional web-based survey among 1227 parents and 1406 non-parents who were potential stakeholders in psychiatric genomic research.ResultsParticipants generally expressed positive views on children’s participation in genomic research. The informants in the qualitative interviews highlighted the age of the child as a critical aspect when disclosing genetic information. Other important aspects were the child’s right to an autonomous choice, the emotional burden of knowing imposed on both the child and the parents, and the possibility of receiving beneficial clinical information regarding the future health of the child. Nevertheless, there was no consensus whether the parent or the child should receive the findings. A majority of survey stakeholders agreed that children should be able to participate in genomic research. The majority agreed that both pertinent and incidental findings should be returned to the parents and to the child when of legal age. Having children does not affect the stakeholder’s attitudes towards the inclusion of children as research subjects in genomic research.ConclusionOur findings illustrate that both the child’s right to autonomy and the parents’ interest to be informed are important factors that are found valuable by the participants.

Today, dietary treatment with restricted phenylalanine intake supplemented with non-phenylalanine amino acids to support growth and maintain a healthy body composition remains the mainstay of therapy. However, a better understanding is needed of the factors that influence N balance in the context of amino acid supplementation. The aim of the present paper is to summarise considerations for improving N balance in patients with PKU, with a focus on gaining greater understanding of amino acid absorption, disposition and utilisation. In addition, the impact of phenylalanine-free amino acids on 24 h blood phenylalanine/tyrosine circadian rhythm is evaluated. We compare the effects of administering intact protein v. free amino acid on protein metabolism and discuss the possibility of improving outcomes by administering amino acid mixtures so that their absorption profile mimics that of intact protein. Protein substitutes with the ability to delay absorption of phenylalanine and tyrosine, mimicking physiological absorption kinetics, are expected to improve the rate of assimilation into protein and minimise fluctuations in quantitative plasma amino acid levels. They may also help maintain normal glycaemia and satiety sensation.

We have developed plasmid vectors for transformation of R. toruloides which include elements for Saccharomyces cerevisiae in-yeast assembly; this method is robust to the assembly of GC-rich DNA and of large plasmids. Using such vectors we screened for controllable promoters, and identified inducible promoters from the genes NAR1, ICL1, CTR3, and MET16. These four promoters have independent induction/repression conditions and exhibit different levels and rates of induction in R. toruloides, making them appropriate for controllable transgene expression in different experimental situations. Nested deletions were used to identify regulatory regions in the four promoters, and to delimit the minimal inducible promoters, which are as small as 200 bp for the NAR1 promoter. The NAR1 promoter shows very tight regulation under repressed conditions as determined both by an EGFP reporter gene and by conditional rescue of a leu2 mutant.

We assessed relationships between dietary intake and nutrient source (food or MF) on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers (BTM) in PAH deficiency. Blood from 44 fasted females 11–52 years of age was analyzed for plasma phenylalanine, serum BTM [CTx (resorption), P1NP (formation)], vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). BTM ratios were calculated to assess resorption relative to formation (CTx/P1NP). Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry measured total BMD and age-matched Z-scores. Three-day food records were analyzed for total nutrient intake, nutrients by source (food, MF), and compliance with MF prescription. Spearman’s partial coefficients (adjusted for age, BMI, energy intake, blood phenylalanine) assessed correlations. All had normal BMD for age (Z-score >−2). Sixty-four percent had high resorption and normal formation indicating uncoupled bone turnover. CTx/P1NP was positively associated with food phenylalanine (r

Females with PAH deficiency had normal BMD but elevated BTM, particularly resorption. More favorable ratios were associated with nutrients from MF and compliance. Younger females had less favorable BTM ratios. Promoting micronutrient intake through compliance with MF may impact bone metabolism in patients with PAH deficiency.

Emerging data suggests that altered blood levels of amino acids and acylcarnitines are also associated with common metabolic diseases in adults.

We applied a targeted mass-spectrometry-based method to analyze whole blood concentrations of 96 amino acids, acylcarnitines and pathway associated metabolite ratios in a Central European cohort of 2,107 adults and performed genome-wide association (GWA) to identify genetic modifiers of metabolite concentrations. We discovered and replicated six novel loci associated with blood levels of total acylcarnitine, arginine (both on chromosome 6; rs12210538, rs17657775), propionylcarnitine (chromosome 10; rs12779637), 2-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (chromosome 21; rs1571700), stearoylcarnitine (chromosome 1; rs3811444), and aspartic acid traits (chromosome 8; rs750472). Based on an integrative analysis of expression quantitative trait loci in blood mononuclear cells and correlations between gene expressions and metabolite levels, we provide evidence for putative causative genes: SLC22A16 for total acylcarnitines, ARG1 for arginine, HLCS for 2-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine, JAM3 for stearoylcarnitine via a trans-effect at chromosome 1, and PPP1R16A for aspartic acid traits. Further, we report replication and provide additional functional evidence for ten loci that have previously been published for metabolites measured in plasma, serum or urine.In conclusion, our integrative analysis of SNP, gene-expression and metabolite data points to novel genetic factors that may be involved in the regulation of human metabolism.

Often, algorithmic classifiers are tasked with predicting binary traits (e.g. positive or negative for a disease) from missense variation. Though useful, this arrangement is limiting and contrived, because human diseases often comprise a spectrum of severities, rather than a discrete partitioning of patient populations. Furthermore, labeling variants as causal or benign can be error prone, which is problematic for training supervised learning algorithms (the so-called garbage in, garbage out phenomenon). We explore the potential value of training classifiers using continuous-valued quantitative measurements, rather than binary traits. Using 20 variants from cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) nucleotide-binding domains and six quantitative measures of cystic fibrosis (CF) severity, we trained classifiers to predict CF severity from CFTR variants. Employing cross validation, classifier prediction and measured clinical/functional values were significantly correlated for four of six quantitative traits (correlation P-values from 1.35 × 10−4 to 4.15 × 10−3). Classifiers were also able to stratify variants by three clinically relevant risk categories with 85–100% accuracy, depending on which of the six quantitative traits was used for training. Finally, we characterized 11 additional CFTR variants using clinical sweat chloride testing, two functional assays, or all three diagnostics, and validated our classifier using blind prediction. Predictions were within the measured sweat chloride range for seven of eight variants, and captured the differential impact of specific variants on the two functional assays.

These epilepsies can present across the life span, and share features of refractoriness to anti-epileptic drugs, and are often associated with co-morbid developmental delay/regression, intellectual, and behavioral impairments. Some of these disorders are amenable to specific treatment interventions; hence timely and appropriate diagnosis is critical to improve outcomes. In this review, we discuss those disorders in which epilepsy is a dominant feature and present an approach to the clinical recognition, diagnosis, and management of these disorders, with a greater focus on primarily treatable conditions.

This study was conducted to determine if three prototype 4-mg nicotine lozenges produced locally in India were bioequivalent to a globally marketed reference product, Nicorette® 4-mg nicotine lozenge. Materials and methods: Healthy adult smokers (N = 39) were treated with three prototype 4-mg nicotine lozenges in comparison with a reference 4-mg lozenge in this single-center, randomized, open-label, single-dose, 4-way crossover study. Pharmacokinetic sampling was obtained to test for bioequivalence using maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and extent of absorption (AUC0–t). Secondarily, AUC0–∞, time to maximal plasma concentration (tmax), half-life (T1/2), elimination rate constant (Kel), and safety of the prototype lozenges versus the reference lozenge were compared. Results: Each prototype 4-mg nicotine lozenge was found to be bioequivalent to the reference 4-mg nicotine lozenge based on the ratio of geometric means and 90% confidence intervals for Cmax, AUC0–t, and AUC0–∞. Although tmax was significantly longer for prototype III, all four lozenges achieved maximum plasma nicotine concentrations at a median of 1.5 hours. The safety profiles of the three prototype 4-mg lozenges did not differ from that of the 4-mg reference product. Conclusion: Each prototype 4-mg nicotine lozenge was bioequivalent to the reference 4-mg nicotine lozenge and was well tolerated. Furthermore, as these bioequivalent prototypes differed in in-vitro dissolution profiles, these data suggest that performance from the in vitro method deployed is not a firm predictor of pharmacokinetic behavior.

Most individuals with HPA harbor mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), and a small proportion (2%) exhibit tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency with additional neurotransmitter (dopamine and serotonin) deficiency. Here we report six individuals from four unrelated families with HPA who exhibited progressive neurodevelopmental delay, dystonia, and a unique profile of neurotransmitter deficiencies without mutations in PAH or BH4 metabolism disorder-related genes. In these six affected individuals, whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified biallelic mutations in DNAJC12, which encodes a heat shock co-chaperone family member that interacts with phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylases catalyzing the BH4-activated conversion of phenylalanine into tyrosine, tyrosine into L-dopa (the precursor of dopamine), and tryptophan into 5-hydroxytryptophan (the precursor of serotonin), respectively. DNAJC12 was undetectable in fibroblasts from the individuals with null mutations. PAH enzyme activity was reduced in the presence of DNAJC12 mutations. Early treatment with BH4 and/or neurotransmitter precursors had dramatic beneficial effects and resulted in the prevention of neurodevelopmental delay in the one individual treated before symptom onset. Thus, DNAJC12 deficiency is a preventable and treatable cause of intellectual disability that should be considered in the early differential diagnosis when screening results are positive for HPA.

About 7,000 different rare entities are distinguished and, among them, rare diseases of the thyroid gland. Although not frequent, they can be found in the everyday practice of endocrinologists and should be considered in differential diagnosis. Rare non-neoplastic thyroid diseases will be discussed. Congenital hypothyroidism’s frequency is relatively high and its early treatment is of vital importance for neonatal psychomotor development; CH is caused primarily by thyroid dysgenesis (85%) or dyshormonogenesis (10-15%), although secondary defects - hypothalamic and pituitary - can also be found; up to 40% of cases diagnosed on neonatal screening are transient. Inherited abnormalities of thyroid hormone binding proteins (TBG, TBP and albumin) include alterations in their concentration or affinity for iodothyronines, this leads to laboratory test abnormalities, although usually with normal free hormones and clinical euthyroidism. Thyroid hormone resistance is most commonly found in THRB gene mutations and more rarely in THRA mutations; in some cases both genes are unchanged (non-TR RTH). Recently the term ‘reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormones’ was introduced, which encompass not only iodothyronine receptor defects but also their defective transmembrane transport or metabolism. Rare causes of hyperthyroidism are: activating mutations in TSHR or GNAS genes, pituitary adenomas, differentiated thyroid cancer or gestational trophoblastic disease; congenital hyperthyroidism cases are also seen, although less frequently than CH. Like other organs and tissues, the thyroid can be affected by different inflammatory and infectious processes, including tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. In most of the rare thyroid diseases genetic factors play a key role, many of them can be classified as monogenic disorders.

Several elements that affect CCHD screening costs were assessed in varying numbers of studies, including screening staff time, instrumentation, and consumables, as well as costs of diagnosis and treatment. A previous US study that used conservative assumptions suggested that CCHD screening is likely to be considered cost-effective from the healthcare sector perspective. Newly available estimates of avoided infant CCHD deaths in several US states that implemented mandatory CCHD screening policies during 2011–2013 suggest a substantially larger reduction in deaths than was projected in the previous US cost-effectiveness analysis. Taking into account these new estimates, we estimate that cost per life-year gained could be as low as USD 12,000.

The molecular mechanisms of protein aggregation and therefore the biophysical parameters favoring protein aggregation are better understood. Here we perform an in silico survey of the impact of human sequence variation on the aggregation propensity of human proteins. We find that disease-associated variations are statistically significantly enriched in mutations that increase the aggregation potential of human proteins when compared to neutral sequence variations. These findings suggest that protein aggregation might have a broader impact on human disease than generally assumed and that beyond loss-of-function, the aggregation of mutant proteins involved in cancer, immune disorders or inflammation could potentially further contribute to disease by additional burden on cellular protein homeostasis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4560525/,abstract

1128,,28149263,"Go to:AbstractIntroductionThrough the introduction of advanced analytical techniques and improved throughput, the scope of dried blood spot testing utilising mass spectrometric methods, has broadly expanded. Clinicians and researchers have become very enthusiastic about the potential applications of dried blood spot based mass spectrometric applications. Analysts on the other hand face challenges of sensitivity, reproducibility and overall accuracy of dried blood spot quantification. In this review, we aim to bring together these two facets to discuss the advantages and current challenges of non-newborn screening applications of dried blood spot quantification by mass spectrometry.MethodsTo address these aims we performed a key word search of the PubMed and MEDLINE online databases in conjunction with individual manual searches to gather information. Keywords for the initial search included; “blood spot” and “mass spectrometry”; while excluding “newborn”; and “neonate”. In addition, databases were restricted to English language and human specific. There was no time period limit applied.ResultsAs a result of these selection criteria, 194 references were identified for review. For presentation, this information is divided into: 1) clinical applications; and 2) analytical considerations across the total testing process; being pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical considerations.ConclusionsDBS analysis using MS applications is now broadly applied, with drug monitoring for both therapeutic and toxicological analysis being the most extensively reported. Several parameters can affect the accuracy of DBS measurement and further bridge experiments are required to develop adjustment rules for comparability between dried blood spot measures and the equivalent serum/plasma values. Likewise, the establishment of independent reference intervals for dried blood spot sample matrix is required.Key words: dried blood spots, mass spectrometry, total testing process",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5282914/,abstract

However, medical success is largely dependent on the identification of the large number of people unaware of these infections, especially in developing countries. Dried blood spots (DBS) have been demonstrated to be a good tool for collecting, storing and transporting clinical specimens from rural areas and limited-resource settings to laboratory facilities, where viral infections can be more reliably diagnosed.Methods:The seroprevalence and virological characterization of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as human retroviruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 [HTLV-1] and human T-cell leukaemia virus type 2 [HTLV-2]), were investigated in clinical specimens collected from DBS in Ghana.Results:A total of 305 consecutive DBS were collected. A high prevalence of chronic HBV (8.5%) and occult hepatitis B (14.2%) was found, whereas rates were lower for HIV-1, HTLV-1 and HCV (3.2%, 1.3% and 0.6%, respectively). HIV-2 and HTLV-2 were absent. CRF02_AG was the predominant HIV-1 subtype, whereas genotype E was the most frequent HBV variant.Conclusions:DBS are helpful in the diagnosis and virological characterization of hepatitis and retrovirus infections in resource-limited settings. The high rate of hepatitis B in Ghana, either overt or occult, is noteworthy and confirms recent findings from other sub-Saharan countries. This should encourage close clinical follow up and antiviral treatment assessment in this population, as well as universal HBV vaccine campaigns.Keywords: dried blood spots, Ghana, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV-1, human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1, occult hepatitis B",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535694/,abstract

The psychostimulant methylphenidate is the most frequently used medication to treat it. Several studies have investigated the benefits of methylphenidate, showing possible favourable effects on ADHD symptoms, but the true magnitude of the effect is unknown. Concerning adverse events associated with the treatment, our systematic review of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated no increase in serious adverse events, but a high proportion of participants suffered a range of non‐serious adverse events.ObjectivesTo assess the adverse events associated with methylphenidate treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD in non‐randomised studies.Search methodsIn January 2016, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 12 other databases and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional studies.Selection criteriaWe included non‐randomised study designs. These comprised comparative and non‐comparative cohort studies, patient‐control studies, patient reports/series and cross‐sectional studies of methylphenidate administered at any dosage or formulation. We also included methylphenidate groups from RCTs assessing methylphenidate versus other interventions for ADHD as well as data from follow‐up periods in RCTs. Participants had to have an ADHD diagnosis (from the 3rd to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the 9th or 10th edition of theInternational Classification of Diseases, with or without comorbid diagnoses. We required that at least 75% of participants had a normal intellectual capacity (intelligence quotient of more than 70 points) and were aged below 20 years. We excluded studies that used another ADHD drug as a co‐intervention.Data collection and analysisFourteen review authors selected studies independently. Two review authors assessed risk of bias independently using the ROBINS‐I tool for assessing risk of bias in non‐randomised studies of interventions. All review authors extracted data. We defined serious adverse events according to the International Committee of Harmonization as any lethal, life‐threatening or life‐changing event. We considered all other adverse events to be non‐serious adverse events and conducted meta‐analyses of data from comparative studies. We calculated meta‐analytic estimates of prevalence from non‐comparative cohorts studies and synthesised data from patient reports/series qualitatively. We investigated heterogeneity by conducting subgroup analyses, and we also conducted sensitivity analyses.Main resultsWe included a total of 260 studies: 7 comparative cohort studies, 6 of which compared 968 patients who were exposed to methylphenidate to 166 controls, and 1 which assessed 1224 patients that were exposed or not exposed to methylphenidate during different time periods; 4 patient‐control studies (53,192 exposed to methylphenidate and 19,906 controls); 177 non‐comparative cohort studies (2,207,751 participants); 2 cross‐sectional studies (96 participants) and 70 patient reports/series (206 participants). Participants' ages ranged from 3 years to 20 years. Risk of bias in the included comparative studies ranged from moderate to critical, with most studies showing critical risk of bias. We evaluated all non‐comparative studies at critical risk of bias. The GRADE quality rating of the evidence was very low.Primary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate increased the risk ratio (RR) of serious adverse events (RR 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.57; 2 studies, 72,005 participants); any psychotic disorder (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.57; 1 study, 71,771 participants); and arrhythmia (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.74; 1 study, 1224 participants) compared to no intervention.In the non‐comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate experiencing any serious adverse event was 1.20% (95% CI 0.70% to 2.00%; 50 studies, 162,422 participants). Withdrawal from methylphenidate due to any serious adverse events occurred in 1.20% (95% CI 0.60% to 2.30%; 7 studies, 1173 participants) and adverse events of unknown severity led to withdrawal in 7.30% of participants (95% CI 5.30% to 10.0%; 22 studies, 3708 participants).Secondary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate, compared to no intervention, increased the RR of insomnia and sleep problems (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.24 to 5.34; 3 studies, 425 participants) and decreased appetite (RR 15.06, 95% CI 2.12 to 106.83; 1 study, 335 participants).With non‐comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate with any non‐serious adverse events was 51.2% (95% CI 41.2% to 61.1%; 49 studies, 13,978 participants). These included difficulty falling asleep, 17.9% (95% CI 14.7% to 21.6%; 82 studies, 11,507 participants); headache, 14.4% (95% CI 11.3% to 18.3%; 90 studies, 13,469 participants); abdominal pain, 10.7% (95% CI 8.60% to 13.3%; 79 studies, 11,750 participants); and decreased appetite, 31.1% (95% CI 26.5% to 36.2%; 84 studies, 11,594 participants). Withdrawal of methylphenidate due to non‐serious adverse events occurred in 6.20% (95% CI 4.80% to 7.90%; 37 studies, 7142 participants), and 16.2% were withdrawn for unknown reasons (95% CI 13.0% to 19.9%; 57 studies, 8340 participants).Authors' conclusionsOur findings suggest that methylphenidate may be associated with a number of serious adverse events as well as a large number of non‐serious adverse events in children and adolescents, which often lead to withdrawal of methylphenidate. Our certainty in the evidence is very low, and accordingly, it is not possible to accurately estimate the actual risk of adverse events. It might be higher than reported here.Given the possible association between methylphenidate and the adverse events identified, it may be important to identify people who are most susceptible to adverse events. To do this we must undertake large‐scale, high‐quality RCTs, along with studies aimed at identifying responders and non‐responders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6494554/,abstract

There are no therapies that can delay the progression of this devastating disease. One feature of HD that may play a critical role in its pathogenesis is metabolic disruption. Consequently, we undertook a comparative study of metabolites in our transgenic sheep model of HD (OVT73). This model does not display overt symptoms of HD but has circadian rhythm alterations and molecular changes characteristic of the early phase disease. Quantitative metabolite profiles were generated from the motor cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and liver tissue of 5 year old transgenic sheep and matched controls by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Differentially abundant metabolites were evident in the cerebellum and liver. There was striking tissue-specificity, with predominantly amino acids affected in the transgenic cerebellum and fatty acids in the transgenic liver, which together may indicate a hyper-metabolic state. Furthermore, there were more strong pair-wise correlations of metabolite abundance in transgenic than in wild-type cerebellum and liver, suggesting altered metabolic constraints. Together these differences indicate a metabolic disruption in the sheep model of HD and could provide insight into the presymptomatic human disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4749952/,abstract

This paper aims to cross the boundaries between medicine and forensics by exploring the flows between the ethical issues presented in the two domains and the subsequent conceptualisation of public trust and legitimisation. We propose to introduce the concept of ‘solidarity’, traditionally applied only to medical and research biobanks, into a consideration of public engagement in medicine and forensics. Inclusion of a solidarity-based framework, in both medical biobanks and forensic DNA databases, raises new questions that should be included in the ethical debate, in relation to both health services/medical research and activities associated with the criminal justice system.Keywords: Genetic Information, Government/Criminal Justice, Public Policy, Rights, Social Aspects",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4621370/,abstract
1133,10.1002/mgg3.610,30829006,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundGenetic heterogeneity and compound heterozygosis give rise to a continuous spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency and metabolic phenotypes in phenylketonuria (PKU). The most used parameters for evaluating phenotype in PKU are pretreatment phenylalanine (Phe) levels, tolerance for dietary Phe, and Phe overloading test. Phenotype can vary from a “classic” (severe) form to mild hyperphenylalaninemia, which does not require dietary treatment. A subset of patients is responsive to treatment by the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Genotypes of PKU patients from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were compared to predicted and observed phenotypes. Genotype‐based estimations of responsiveness to BH4 were also conducted.MethodsPhenotype was defined by pretreatment Phe levels. A standard prediction system based on arbitrary assigned values was employed to measure genotype‐phenotype concordance. Patients were also estimated as BH4‐responders according to the responsiveness previously reported for their mutations and genotypes.ResultsA 48.3% concordance rate between genotype‐predicted and observed phenotypes was found. When the predicted phenotypes included those reported at the BIOPKU database, the concordance rate reached 77%. A total of 18 genotypes from 30 patients (29.4%) were estimated as of potential or probable BH4 responsiveness. Inconsistencies were observed in genotypic combinations including the common “moderate” mutations p.R261Q, p.V388M, and p.I65T and the mild mutations p.L48S, p.R68S, and p.L249F.ConclusionThe high discordance rate between genotype‐predicted and observed metabolic phenotypes in this study seems to be due partially to the high frequency of the so‐called “moderate” common mutations, p.R261Q, p.V388M, and p.I65T, which are reported to be associated to erratic or more severe than expected metabolic phenotypes. Although our results of BH4 estimated responsiveness must be regarded as tentative, it should be emphasized that genotyping and genotype‐phenotype association studies are important in selecting patients to be offered a BH4 overload test, especially in low‐resource settings like Brazil.Keywords: Brazil, genetic association studies, genotype, hyperphenylalaninemia, phenotype, phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylketonuria",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6503030/,abstract

The tests use either amino acid mixtures or proteins. Current amino acid mixtures lack specificity in humans, but not in rodents, because of the faster disposal of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) by the latter. The high content of BCAA (30-60%) is responsible for the poor specificity in humans and we recommend, in a 50g dose, the control formulation of Young et al. (1985) with a lowered BCAA content (18%) and minor modifications as a common control for the above tests. With protein-based formulations, α-lactalbumin is specific for ATL, whereas gelatine is only partially effective for ATD. We recommend the use of the whey protein fraction glycomacropeptide (GMP) as an alternative protein. Its BCAA content is ideal for specificity and the absence of Trp, Tyr and Phe render it suitable as a template for 7 formulations (separate and combined depletion or loading and a truly balanced control). We invite the research community to participate in standardization of the depletion and loading methodologies by using our recommended amino acid formulation and developing those based on GMP.Keywords: Acute tryptophan depletion and loading, Acute tyrosine and phenylalanine depletion, Anxiety, Behaviour, Branched-chain amino acids, Glutamatergic function, Glycomacropeptide, Serotonin, Tryptophan, Tyrosine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5516789/,abstract
1135,10.22074/cellj.2016.4318,27540528,"Go to:AbstractObjective The phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus has high linkage disequilibrium. Haplotypes related to this locus may thus be considered sufficiently informative for genetic diagnosis and carrier screening using multi-allelic markers. In this study, we present an efficient
method for haplotype analysis of PAH locus using multiplexing dyes. In addition, we explain
how to resolve the dye shift challenge in multiplex short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping.
Materials and Methods One hundred family trios were included in this descriptive
study. The forward primer of a tetra-nucleotide STR and the reverse primer of a variable
number tandem repeat (VNTR) were labeled with three different non-overlapping dyes
5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM), 6-carboxy-N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylrhodamine (HEX) and 6-carboxy-N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
products from each family trio were multiplexed for capillary electrophoresis and results
were analyzed using Peak Scanner software.
Results Multiplexing trio products decreased the cost significantly. The TAMRA labeled products had a significant predictable shift (migrated at a slower electrophoretic rate) relative to the
HEX and FAM labeled products. Through our methodology we achieve, the less inter-dye shift
than intra-dye shift variance. Correcting the dye shift in the labeled products, according to the
reference allele size, significantly decreased the inter-dye variability (P<0.001).
ConclusionMultiplexing trio products helps to detect and resolve the dye shift accurately
in each family, which otherwise would result in diagnostic error. The dye system of FAM,
HEX and TAMRA is more feasible and cheaper than other dye systems.Keywords: Microsatellite Repeats, Fluorescent Dyes, Capillary Electrophoresis, Diagnostic

This genetic diversity is responsible for many of the interindividual differences in food preferences, nutritional needs, and dietary responses between humans. The field of nutrigenetics aims to utilize this type of genetic information in order to personalize diets for optimal health. One of the most well-studied genetic variants affecting human dietary patterns and health is the lactase persistence mutation, which enables an individual to digest milk sugar into adulthood. Lactase persistence is one of the most influential Mendelian factors affecting human dietary patterns to occur since the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution. However, the lactase persistence mutation is only one of many mutations that can influence the relationship between dairy intake and disease risk. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available nutrigenetic literature investigating the relationships between genetics, dairy intake, and health outcomes. Nonetheless, the understanding of an individual’s nutrigenetic responses is just one component of personalized nutrition. In addition to nutrigenetic responses, future studies should also take into account nutrigenomic responses (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic), and phenotypic/characteristic traits (age, gender, activity level, disease status, etc.), as these factors all interact with diet to influence health.Keywords: nutrigenetics, gene–diet interactions, precision nutrition, polymorphisms, inter-individual response, dairy, milk, lactase persistence, obesity, cardiometabolic disease",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537825/,abstract

However, neither an official training program for genetic counseling, nor formal board certification, was available in China before 2015. In 2009, a genetic counseling training program based on role-playing was implemented as a pilot study at the Third Military Medical University to train third-year medical students.MethodsQuestionnaires on participant attitudes to the program and role-playing were randomly administered to 324 students after they had finished their training. Pre- and post-training instructional tests, focusing on 42 key components of genetic counseling, were administered randomly to 200 participants to assess mastery of each component. Finally, scores in final examinations of 578 participants from 2009 to 2011 were compared to scores obtained by 614 non-participating students from 2006 to 2008 to further assess program efficacy.ResultsBoth the training program and the instructional strategy of role-playing were accepted by most participants. Students believed that role-playing improved their practice of genetic counseling and medical genetics, enhanced their communication skills, and would likely contribute to future professional performance. The average understanding of 40 of the key points in genetic counseling was significantly improved, and most students approached excellent levels of mastery.

Experiences appear to be constant, regardless of the specific rare disease diagnosis. Systematically collected Australian data to support policy response on rare diseases are scarce. We address this gap by providing survey results about 462 children aged <19 years living with approximately 200 different rare diseases.ResultsOf 462 children, 96% were born in Australia, 55% were male, median age was 8.9 years (0–18.2). Four-hundred-and-twenty-eight (93%) had received a definitive diagnosis but 29 (7%) remained undiagnosed. Before receiving the correct diagnosis 38% consulted ≥ 6 different doctors. Among those with a diagnosis, 37% believed the diagnosis was delayed and 27% initially received a wrong diagnosis. Consequences of delayed diagnosis include anxiety, loss of reproductive confidence because of an ill-defined genetic risk, frustration and stress (54%), disease progression (37%), delays in treatment (25%) and inappropriate treatments (10%). Perceived reasons for diagnostic delays included lack of knowledge about the disease among health professionals (69.2%), lack of symptom awareness by the family (21.2%) and difficulties accessing tests (17.9%). Children with inborn errors of metabolism were less likely to have a delayed diagnosis compared with other disease groups (Chi-Sq = 17.1; P < 0.0001), most likely due to well-established and accessible biochemical screening processes. Diagnosis was given in person in 74% of cases, telephone in 18.5% and via a letter in 3.5%. Some families (16%) were dissatisfied with the way the diagnosis was delivered, citing lack of empathy and lack of information from health professionals. Psychological support at diagnosis was provided to 47.5%, but 86.2% believed that it should always be provided. Although 74.9% of parents believed that the diagnosis could have an impact on future family planning, only 44.8% received genetic counselling.ConclusionParents of children living with rare chronic and complex diseases have called for better education, resourcing of health professionals to prevent avoidable diagnostic delays, and to facilitate access to early interventions and treatments.

Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of the retrieved articles and extracted data from them. Study-specific relative risk estimates were pooled by random-effects or fixed-effects models. From the 11272 references, a total of 16 case-control studies and 3 cohort studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis.ResultsThe overall relative risk of CHD in parous versus nulliparous women was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.97–1.06; Q = 32.34; P = 0.006; I2 = 53.6%). Furthermore, we observed a significant association between the highest versus lowest parity number, with an overall RR = 1.20 (95% CI, 1.10–1.31; (Q = 74.61, P<0.001, I2 = 82.6%). A dose–response analysis also indicated a positive effect of maternal parity on CHD risk, and the overall increase in relative risk per one live birth was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.02–1.09); Q = 68.09; P<0.001; I2 = 80.9%). We conducted stratified and meta-regression analyses to identify the origin of the heterogeneity among studies. A Galbraith plot was created to graphically assess the sources of heterogeneity.ConclusionIn summary, this meta-analysis provided a robust estimate of the positive association between maternal parity and risk of CHD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4189919/,abstract

1146,10.1152/physrev.00006.2014,25540143,"Go to:AbstractMitochondrial respiration, an important bioenergetic process, relies on operation of four membranous enzymatic complexes linked functionally by mobile, freely diffusible elements: quinone molecules in the membrane and water-soluble cytochromes c in the intermembrane space. One of the mitochondrial complexes, complex III (cytochrome bc1 or ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase), provides an electronic connection between these two diffusible redox pools linking in a fully reversible manner two-electron quinone oxidation/reduction with one-electron cytochrome c reduction/oxidation. Several features of this homodimeric enzyme implicate that in addition to its well-defined function of contributing to generation of proton-motive force, cytochrome bc1 may be a physiologically important point of regulation of electron flow acting as a sensor of the redox state of mitochondria that actively responds to changes in bioenergetic conditions. These features include the following: the opposing redox reactions at quinone catalytic sites located on the opposite sides of the membrane, the inter-monomer electronic connection that functionally links four quinone binding sites of a dimer into an H-shaped electron transfer system, as well as the potential to generate superoxide and release it to the intermembrane space where it can be engaged in redox signaling pathways. Here we highlight recent advances in understanding how cytochrome bc1 may accomplish this regulatory physiological function, what is known and remains unknown about catalytic and side reactions within the quinone binding sites and electron transfers through the cofactor chains connecting those sites with the substrate redox pools. We also discuss the developed molecular mechanisms in the context of physiology of mitochondria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4281590/,abstract

However, due to the lack of clinical samples and records, the molecular cause for rare diseases is always hard to identify, significantly limiting the number of rare Mendelian diseases diagnosed through sequencing technologies. Clinical phenotype information therefore becomes a major resource to diagnose rare diseases. In this article, we adopted both a phenotypic similarity method and a machine learning method to build four diagnostic models to support rare disease diagnosis. All the diagnostic models were validated using the real medical records from RAMEDIS. Each model provides a list of the top 10 candidate diseases as the prediction outcome and the results showed that all models had a high diagnostic precision (≥98%) with the highest recall reaching up to 95% while the models with machine learning methods showed the best performance. To promote effective diagnosis for rare disease in clinical application, we developed the phenotype-based Rare Disease Auxiliary Diagnosis system (RDAD) to assist clinicians in diagnosing rare diseases with the above four diagnostic models.

A meta‐analysis of observational studies was performed to address the question of whether women who had a history of viral infection in early pregnancy were at an increased risk of CHD in offspring, compared with mothers without viral infection.Methods and ResultsUnrestricted searches were conducted, with an end date parameter of July 15, 2018, of PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Libraries, and Chinese databases, to identify studies that met prestated inclusion criteria. Seventeen case‐control studies involving 67 233 women were included for analysis. Both fixed‐effects models (odds ratio [OR], 1.83; 95% CI, 1.58–2.12; P<0.0001) and random‐effects models (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.54–3.36; P<0.0001) suggested that mothers who had a history of viral infection in early pregnancy experienced a significantly increased risk of developing CHD in offspring. For specific viral infections, the risk of developing CHD in offspring was significantly increased among mothers with rubella virus (OR, 3.49, 95% CI, 2.39–5.11 in fixed‐effects models; and OR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.75–7.15 in random‐effects models) and cytomegalovirus (OR, 3.95; 95% CI, 1.87–8.36 in fixed‐effects models) in early pregnancy; however, other maternal viral infections in early pregnancy were not significantly associated with risk of CHD in offspring.

Zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea is currently recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).ObjectivesTo evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, mRCT, and reference lists up to 30 September 2016. We also contacted researchers.Selection criteriaRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral zinc supplementation with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.Data collection and analysisBoth review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. The primary outcomes were diarrhoea duration and severity. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta‐analyses (using either a fixed‐effect or random‐effects model) and assessed heterogeneity.We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.Main resultsThirty‐three trials that included 10,841 children met our inclusion criteria. Most included trials were conducted in Asian countries that were at high risk of zinc deficiency.Acute diarrhoeaThere is currently not enough evidence from well‐conducted RCTs to be able to say whether zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea reduces death or number of children hospitalized (very low certainty evidence).In children older than six months of age, zinc supplementation may shorten the average duration of diarrhoea by around half a day (MD −11.46 hours, 95% CI −19.72 to −3.19; 2581 children, 9 trials, low certainty evidence), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 3865 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence). In children with signs of malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around a day (MD −26.39 hours, 95% CI −36.54 to −16.23; 419 children, 5 trials, high certainty evidence).Conversely, in children younger than six months of age, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no effect on the mean duration of diarrhoea (MD 5.23 hours, 95% CI −4.00 to 14.45; 1334 children, 2 trials, low certainty evidence), or the number of children who still have diarrhoea on day seven (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54; 1074 children, 1 trial, low certainty evidence).None of the included trials reported serious adverse events. However, zinc supplementation increased the risk of vomiting in both age groups (children greater than six months of age: RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.86; 2605 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence; children less than six months of age: RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.24; 1334 children, 2 trials, moderate certainty evidence).Persistent diarrhoeaIn children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the average duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (MD −15.84 hours, 95% CI −25.43 to −6.24; 529 children, 5 trials, moderate certainty evidence).Authors' conclusionsIn areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of malnutrition is high, zinc may be of benefit in children aged six months or more. The current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplementation in children less six months of age, in well‐nourished children, and in settings where children are at low risk of zinc deficiency.Keywords: Child, Preschool; Humans; Infant; Acute Disease; Age Factors; Developing Countries; Diarrhea; Diarrhea/drug therapy; Diarrhea/mortality; Diarrhea, Infantile; Diarrhea, Infantile/drug therapy; Diarrhea, Infantile/mortality; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time Factors; Trace Elements; Trace Elements/adverse effects; Trace Elements/deficiency; Trace Elements/therapeutic use; Zinc; Zinc/adverse effects; Zinc/deficiency; Zinc/therapeutic use",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5450879/,abstract

Few studies have evaluated health utilities for rare conditions; even fewer have incorporated disutility that may be experienced by caregivers. This study aimed to (1) estimate health utilities for three rare conditions currently recommended for newborn screening at the state or federal level, and (2) estimate the disutility, or spillover, experienced by parents of patients diagnosed with a rare, heritable disorder.MethodsA stated-preference survey using a time trade-off approach elicited health utilities for Krabbe disease, phenylketonuria, and Pompe disease at varying stages (mild, moderate, severe) and onset of disease symptoms (infancy, childhood, and adulthood). We recruited respondents from a nationally representative community sample (n = 862). Respondents valued disease specific health states in three consecutive question frames: (1) adult health state (> = 18 years of age), (2) child health state (< 18 years of age), and (3) as a parent of a child with a condition (parent spillover state). Corresponding mean utilities were calculated for plausible disease states in adulthood and childhood. Mean disutility was estimated for parental spillover. Predictors of utilities were evaluated using a negative binomial regression model.ResultsMore severe conditions and infant health states received lower estimated utility and greater estimated disutility among parents. Conditions with the lowest estimated health utilities were severe infantile Pompe disease (0.40, CI: 0.34–0.46) and infantile Krabbe disease (0.37, CI: 0.32–0.43). Disutility was evident for all conditions evaluated (range: 0.07–0.19).ConclusionsRare childhood conditions are associated with substantial estimated losses in quality of life.

Due to the limited study population, subjects were selected via census, therefore 82 patients were enrolled. The research material consisted of the Persian edition of World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), designed to examine physical, mental, social and environmental health. The data was gathered on two levels-descriptive and inferential- by using the SPSS software, V.20.Results: Results indicated that the low quality of life in the late-diagnosed patients suffering from PKU, with mental, physical, social, and environmental aspects, was below the average. Still, even if it was not gender dependent, QOL was greatly influenced by the educational level of the patients. Moreover, it was discovered that the mental health of the patients above 40 years old was significantly lower than the other age groups.Conclusions: According to the findings of this study, it was recommended that special attention should be given to the improvement of the social and mental health of PKU patients.Keywords: quality of life, social health, phenylketonuria (PKU) patients, WHOQOL BREF questionnaire",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5319252/,abstract

Fructose, a major component of SSBs, may acutely trigger inflammation, which may be one link between SSB consumption and cardiometabolic disease.Objective: We sought to determine whether beverages sweetened with fructose, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and glucose differentially influence systemic inflammation [fasting plasma C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as primary endpoints] acutely and before major changes in body weight. Secondary endpoints included adipose tissue inflammation, intestinal permeability, and plasma fetuin-A as potential mechanistic links between fructose intake and low-grade inflammation.Design: We conducted a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover design dietary intervention (the Diet and Systemic Inflammation Study) in 24 normal-weight to obese adults without fructose malabsorption. Participants drank 4 servings/d of fructose-, glucose-, or HFCS-sweetened beverages accounting for 25% of estimated calorie requirements while consuming a standardized diet ad libitum for three 8-d periods.Results: Subjects consumed 116% of their estimated calorie requirement while drinking the beverages with no difference in total energy intake or body weight between groups as reported previously. Fasting plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein and IL-6 did not differ significantly at the end of the 3 diet periods. We did not detect a consistent differential effect of the diets on measures of adipose tissue inflammation except for adiponectin gene expression in adipose tissue (P = 0.005), which was lowest after the glucose phase. We also did not detect consistent evidence of a differential impact of these sugars on measures of intestinal permeability (lactulose:mannitol test, plasma zonulin, and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein).Conclusion: Excessive amounts of fructose, HFCS, and glucose from SSBs consumed over 8 d did not differentially affect low-grade chronic systemic inflammation in normal-weight to obese adults.

Even though numerous genes have been discovered that play roles in ASD, a good understanding of the pathophysiologic process of ASD is still lacking. The protein–protein interactions between the products of NLGN, SHANK, and NRXN synaptic genes indicate that the dysfunction in synaptic plasticity could be one reason for the development of ASD.

These approaches are based on population allele frequency correlations, not genetic inheritance, and therefore cannot exploit the rich information about inheritance contained within families. They are also hampered by issues of rigorous phenotype definition, multiple test correction, and allelic and locus heterogeneity. We recently developed, tested, and published a powerful gene-gene interaction detection strategy based on conditioning family data on a known disease-causing allele or a disease-associated marker allele4. We successfully applied the method to disease data and used computer simulation to exhaustively test the method for some epistatic models. We knew that the statistic we developed to indicate interaction was less reliable when applied to more-complex interaction models. Here, we improve the statistic and expand the testing procedure. We computer-simulated multipoint linkage data for a disease caused by two interacting loci. We examined epistatic as well as additive models and compared them with heterogeneity models. In all our models, the at-risk genotypes are “major” in the sense that among affected individuals, a substantial proportion has a disease-related genotype. One of the loci (A) has a known disease-related allele (as would have been determined from a previous analysis). We removed (pruned) family members who did not carry this allele; the resultant dataset is referred to as “stratified.” This elimination step has the effect of raising the “penetrance” and detectability at the second locus (B). We used the lod scores for the stratified and unstratified data sets to calculate a statistic that either indicated the presence of interaction or indicated that no interaction was detectable. We show that the new method is robust and reliable for a wide range of parameters. Our statistic performs well both with the epistatic models (false negative rates, i.e., failing to detect interaction, ranging from 0 to 2.5%) and with the heterogeneity models (false positive rates, i.e., falsely detecting interaction, ≤1%). It works well with the additive model except when allele frequencies at the two loci differ widely. We explore those features of the additive model that make detecting interaction more difficult. All testing of this method suggests that it provides a reliable approach to detecting gene-gene interaction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4709060/,abstract

A common approach is to analyze the phenotypic traits separately using univariate analyses and combine the test results through multiple comparisons. This approach may lead to low power. Multivariate functional linear models are developed to connect genetic variant data to multiple quantitative traits adjusting for covariates for a unified analysis. Three types of approximate F-distribution tests based on Pillai–Bartlett trace, Hotelling–Lawley trace, and Wilks’s Lambda are introduced to test for association between multiple quantitative traits and multiple genetic variants in one genetic region. The approximate F-distribution tests provide much more significant results than those of F-tests of univariate analysis and optimal sequence kernel association test (SKAT-O). Extensive simulations were performed to evaluate the false positive rates and power performance of the proposed models and tests. We show that the approximate F-distribution tests control the type I error rates very well. Overall, simultaneous analysis of multiple traits can increase power performance compared to an individual test of each trait. The proposed methods were applied to analyze (1) four lipid traits in eight European cohorts, and (2) three biochemical traits in the Trinity Students Study. The approximate F-distribution tests provide much more significant results than those of F-tests of univariate analysis and SKAT-O for the three biochemical traits. The approximate F-distribution tests of the proposed functional linear models are more sensitive than those of the traditional multivariate linear models that in turn are more sensitive than SKAT-O in the univariate case.

Results from Western blots and enzyme activity assays confirmed the import of TAT-PCC into mitochondria, as well as into patient fibroblasts, where the colocalization of imported TAT-PCC and mitochondria was also confirmed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, a single-dose intraperitoneal injection into PCC-deficient mice decreased the propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine (C3/C2) ratio toward the normal level.

The purpose of this review is to summarize recent progress, in the field of nutritional genomics as it relates to cardiovascular disease.Recent findingsEvidence from recent studies has shown significant effects of gene-diet interactions on CVD biomarkers and the development and progression of CVD. The cardiovascular effects of gene-nutrient interactions with respect to macronutrients and genes such as FTO, ACE, PPARs, TCF7L2, BDNF, MC4R, APOAs, FADS, etc. have shown consistent results across age groups and populations whereas gene-nutrient interaction effects of other genes have only been limited to specific ages, genders or populations and need to validated and confirmed.SummaryThe identification of individual genetic variation influencing diet-related CVD risk is important and may inform future nutritional intervention studies. Although there is ample scientific evidence indicating that the genetic susceptibility to CVD can be modified by diet, we are still not at a stage where this information is easily translated into dietary plans.

Groups did not differ in looking time, pupilometry, or subjective ratings of faces during reappraisal. However, instructions to increase positive and negative emotional responses resulted in less increase in nucleus accumbens and amygdala activations (respectively) in the ASD group, and both regulation instructions resulted in less change in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation in the ASD group.

Background: Phenylketonuria as the most common genetic metabolic disorder is the result of disruption of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. This study was carried out to explore the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutation status of Iranian phenylketonuria patients.

Methods: Blood samples were collected from 30 patients, and hot spot areas of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, including exons 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12 were studied through polymerase chain reaction and sequencing techniques.

Results: Eight different mutations, including 5 missense mutations, 1 splice mutation, 1 nonsense mutation, and 1 Silent/Splice mutation were detected. These mutations were R243X, R261Q, R261X, P281L, R241C, V399V, E280K, and IVS11+1G>C. V399V and R241C were reported for the first time in Iranian population. Three polymorphisms including Q232Q, V245V and L385L and 3 novel intronic variants including IVS10-15A>C, IVS6+44T>G, and IVS6+36 T>G were also detected in this study.

Conclusion: The results of this study prove the heterogeneous status of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutations in the Iranian population, which can be useful in carrier testing and genetic counseling.

The objective of the study was to study mortality rates from congenital malformations among infants < 1 year and to compare them with those in mainland France.MethodsWe used the CEPI DC (INSERM) database, which compiles annual data from death certificates in all French territories using the International Classification of Diseases. Annual deaths for French Guiana and mainland France between 2005 and 2015 were compiled. The age category studied was children less than 1 year and deaths from congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities were compiled. Crude risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to quantify the excess risk of disease in French Guiana.ResultsIn French Guiana between 2005 and 2015 there were 666 deaths of children aged < 1 year, among which, 132 (19.8%) were due to congenital malformations and chromosomal anomalies. Overall the risk ratio of death from congenital malformations and chromosomal anomalies between French Guiana and mainland France was 2.7 (1.5–4.7), P < 0.001 for neurological congenital malformations it was 4.8 (1.2–19.7), P = 0.01 and for congenital malformations of the circulatory system it was 3.3 (1.5–6.9), P = 0.001.ConclusionsThe incidence of death from congenital malformations or chromosomal anomalies in French Guiana was significantly higher than in mainland France. Explanations for this may be infections, genetic causes, nutritional causes, and toxic causes that are prevalent.

Existing diagnostic methods focus on behavioral and performance characteristics, which complicates the diagnosis of patients younger than 3 years-old. The purpose of this study is to characterize metabolic features of ASD that could be used to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis and exploration of ASD etiology. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to evaluate major metabolic fluctuations in 76 organic acids present in urine from 156 children with ASD and from 64 non-autistic children. Three algorithms, Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were used to develop models to distinguish ASD from typically developing (TD) children and to detect potential biomarkers. In an independent testing set, full model of XGBoost with all 76 acids achieved an AUR of 0.94, while reduced model with top 20 acids discovered by voting from these three algorithms achieved 0.93 and represent a good collection of potential ASD biomarkers. In summary, urine organic acids detection with GC/MS combined with XGBoost algorithm could represent a novel and accurate strategy for diagnosis of autism and the discovered potential biomarkers could be valuable for future research on the pathogenesis of autism and possible interventions.Keywords: autism spectrum disorder, biomarker, urine organic acids, Chinese, metabolomics, diagnosis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502994/,abstract

Homozygous siblings with different treatment histories represent an excellent
model to study both the phenotypic manifestation of mutations and the efficacy
of therapy. We compared phenylketonuria (PKU) manifestations in two different
gender siblings who were homozygous carriers of a rare phenylalanine

treatments. PKU caused by mild mutations may be easily underdiagnosed if the
diagnosis is based solely on the phenylalanine (Phe) blood concentration. One
of the described patients is an example of this diagnostic error. For reducing

Dietary factors, physical inactivity, and sedentary behaviors are the major modifiable risk factors for obesity. Nevertheless, many overweight/obese people do not develop diabetes and lifestyle interventions focused on weight loss and diabetes prevention are often ineffective. Traditionally, chronically elevated blood glucose concentrations have been the hallmark of diabetes; however, many individuals will either remain ‘prediabetic’ or regress to normoglycemia. Thus, there is a growing need for innovative strategies to tackle diabetes at scale.

Sponsors included the NIH, the Wellcome Trust, and the United Mitochondrial Diseases Foundation. Dietary supplements have historically been used in the management of PMD due to their potential benefits and perceived low risk, even though little evidence exists regarding their effectiveness. PMD are rare and clinically, phenotypically, and genetically heterogeneous. Thus patient recruitment for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has proven to be challenging. Only a few RCTs examining dietary supplements, singly or in combination with other vitamins and cofactors, are reported in the literature. Regulatory issues pertaining to the use of dietary supplements as treatment modalities further complicate the research and patient access landscape. As a preface to exploring a research agenda, the workshop included presentations and discussions on what PMD are; how nutritional interventions are used in PMD; challenges and barriers to their use; new technologies and approaches to diagnosis and treatment; research opportunities and resources; and perspectives from patient advocacy, industry, and professional organizations. Seven key areas were identified during the workshop. These areas were: 1) defining the disease, 2) clinical trial design, 3) biomarker selection, 4) mechanistic approaches, 5) challenges in using dietary supplements, 6) standards of clinical care, and 7) collaboration issues.

Background. Skeletal fragility is a complication of phenylketonuria (PKU). A diet containing amino acids compared with glycomacropeptide reduces bone size and strength in mice. Objective. We tested the hypothesis that amino acid medical foods (AA-MF) provide a high dietary acid load, subsequently increasing urinary excretion of renal net acid, calcium, and magnesium, compared to glycomacropeptide medical foods (GMP-MF). Design. In a crossover design, 8 participants with PKU (16–35 y) provided food records and 24-hr urine samples after consuming a low-Phe diet in combination with AA-MF and GMP-MF for 1–3 wks. We calculated potential renal acid load (PRAL) of AA-MF and GMP-MF and determined bone mineral density (BMD) measurements using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Results. AA-MF provided 1.5–2.5-fold higher PRAL and resulted in 3-fold greater renal net acid excretion compared to GMP-MF (p = 0.002). Dietary protein, calcium, and magnesium intake were similar. GMP-MF significantly reduced urinary excretion of calcium by 40% (p = 0.012) and magnesium by 30% (p = 0.029). Two participants had low BMD-for-age and trabecular bone scores, indicating microarchitectural degradation. Urinary calcium with AA-MF negatively correlated with L1–L4 BMD. Conclusion. Compared to GMP-MF, AA-MF increase dietary acid load, subsequently increasing urinary calcium and magnesium excretion, and likely contributing to skeletal fragility in PKU.

We show here that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which has three AAAH genes and one AGMO gene, contains BH4 and has genes that function in BH4 synthesis and regeneration. Knockout mutants for putative BH4 synthetic enzyme genes lack the predicted enzymatic activities, synthesize no BH4, and have indistinguishable behavioral and neurotransmitter phenotypes, including serotonin and dopamine deficiency. The BH4 regeneration enzymes are not required for steady-state levels of biogenic amines, but become rate limiting in conditions of reduced BH4 synthesis. BH4-deficient mutants also have a fragile cuticle and are generally hypersensitive to exogenous agents, a phenotype that is not due to AAAH deficiency, but rather to dysfunction in the lipid metabolic enzyme AGMO, which is expressed in the epidermis. Loss of AGMO or BH4 synthesis also specifically alters the sensitivity of C. elegans to bacterial pathogens, revealing a cuticular function for AGMO-dependent lipid metabolism in host–pathogen interactions.Keywords: biopterin, epidermis, serotonin, dopamine, GTPCH, alkylglycerol monooxygenase, AGMO",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423366/,abstract

A total of thirty obese patients (BMI 46·0 (sd 4·4) kg/m2) followed an LCD (Cambridge Weight Plan®, 4184 kJ/d (1000 kcal/d)) for 7 or 11 weeks as preparation for BS. Anthropometric measurements including body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), blood parameters and blood pressure were assessed at weeks 0, 7 and 11. At week 7, the majority of patients (77 %) had reached their target weight, and this was achieved after 5·4 (sem 0·3) weeks. Mean weight loss was 9·3 (sem 0·5) % (P < 0·01) and consisted of 41·6 % fat-free mass (FFM) and 58·4 % fat mass. The weight loss was accompanied by a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (7·1 (sem 2·3) and 7·3 (sem 1·8) mmHg, respectively, all P < 0·01) as well as an improved metabolic profile (8·2 (sem 1·8) % decrease in fasting glucose (P < 0·01), 28·6 (sem 6·4) % decrease in fasting insulin (P < 0·01), 23·1 (sem 2·2) % decrease in LDL (P < 0·01), and 9·7 (sem 4·7) % decrease in TAG (P < 0·05)).

Most agree that mosaicism is less of an issue at the blastocyst stage than at the cleavage stage but whether mosaicism is no issue at all at the blastocyst stage is currently called into question.STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODSA questionnaire was developed on the three major aspects of PGS 2.0: the Why, with general questions such as PGS 2.0 indications; the How, specifically on genetic analysis methods; the When, on the ideal method and timing of embryo biopsy. Thirty-five colleagues have been selected to address these questions on the basis of their experience with PGS, and demonstrated by peer-reviewed publications, presentations at meetings and participation in the discussion. The first group of experts who were asked about ‘The Why’ comprised fertility experts, the second group of molecular biologists were asked about ‘The How’ and the third group of embryologists were asked about ‘The When’. Furthermore, the geographical distribution of the experts has been taken into account. Thirty have filled in the questionnaire as well as actively participated in the redaction of the current paper.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCEThe 30 participants were from Europe (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, UK) and the USA. Array comparative genome hybridization is the most widely used method amongst the participants, but it is slowly being replaced by massive parallel sequencing. Most participants offering PGS 2.0 to their patients prefer blastocyst biopsy. The high efficiency of vitrification of blastocysts has added a layer of complexity to the discussion, and it is not clear whether PGS in combination with vitrification, PGS alone, or vitrification alone, followed by serial thawing and eSET will be the favoured approach. The opinions range from in favour of the introduction of PGS 2.0 for all IVF patients, over the proposal to use PGS as a tool to rank embryos according to their implantation potential, to scepticism towards PGS pending a positive outcome of robust, reliable and large-scale RCTs in distinct patient groups.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONCare was taken to obtain a wide spectrum of views from carefully chosen experts. However, not all invited experts agreed to participate, which explains a lack of geographical coverage in some areas, for example China.

Background and Objective: Orphan drugs have been a highlight of discussions due to their higher prices than non-orphan drugs. There is currently no European consensus on the method of value assessment for orphan drugs. This study assessed the relationship between the prevalence of rare diseases and the annual treatment cost of orphan drugs in France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and UK.
Methods: Approved orphan drugs and prevalence data were extracted from the European Medicines Agency website. Annual treatment costs were calculated using ex-factory price. Simple regression was used to analyse the relationship between costs and prevalence. A specific bivariate analysis was performed for the rarest diseases (≤1 per 10,000).
Results: 120 drugs were analysed. Prevalence ranged from 0.001 to 5 per 10,000 (mean 1.24, median 1). Annual treatment costs per patient ranged from €755 to €1,051,956 (mean €100,000, median €39,303). Results show a statistically significant inverse correlation between annual treatment cost and disease prevalence in all countries (France: r = −0.370, p = 0.002; Germany: r = −0.365, p = 0.002; Italy: r = −0.340, p = 0.002; Spain: r = −0.316, p = 0.041; UK: r = −0.358, p = 0.0004; Sweden: r = −0.414, p = 0.014; Norway: r = −0.367, p = 0.002). When analysis was focused on the rarest diseases, a stronger correlation exists in all countries (France: r = −0.525, Germany: r = −0.482, Italy: r = −0.497, Spain: r = −0.531, UK: r = −0.436, Sweden: r = −0.455, Norway: r = −0.466; all p < 0.05 except Sweden p = 0.077).
Conclusions: This study shows an inverse correlation between annual treatment cost and prevalence with high statistical significance in the studied countries.

It is known that Phe levels are greatly elevated in blood of phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. The molecular mechanism underlying the brain dysfunction characteristic of PKU is unknown.

C57BL/6 mice were divided into control, IBS, and IBS + C. butyricum groups. In the IBS and IBS + C. butyricum groups, the mice were subjected to water avoidance stress (WAS) for 1 h/d for ten days. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) together with multivariate analysis was employed to compare the fecal samples between groups.RESULTSWAS exposure established an appropriate model of IBS in mice, with symptoms of visceral hyperalgesia and diarrhea. The differences in the metabolite profiles between the control group and IBS group significantly changed with the progression of IBS (days 0, 5, 10, and 17). A total of 14 differentially excreted metabolites were identified between the control and IBS groups, and phenylethylamine was a major metabolite induced by stress. In addition, phenylalanine metabolism was found to be the most relevant metabolic pathway. Between the IBS group and IBS + C. butyricum group, 10 differentially excreted metabolites were identified. Among these, pantothenate and coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis metabolites, as well as steroid hormone biosynthesis metabolites were identified as significantly relevant metabolic pathways.CONCLUSIONThe metabolic profile of IBS mice is significantly altered compared to control mice.

Nevertheless, children experience repeated attacks that develop into intractable epilepsy (IE).

Urine and blood samples of 56 children with IE served as the experimental group and 56 cases of children with IE, who were successfully treated served as the control group, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry for the metabolic screening of amino, organic, and fatty acids. Urine routine, hepatic function, blood biochemistry, imageology of encephalon and brain stem-evoked potential (auditory and optical) were also examined. Of the 27 IE children confirmed as abnormal in urine and blood screening, there were 19 cases (70.3%) of hypoevolutism or retrogression of intelligence and motor function, 15 cases (55.5%) of brain stem-evoked potential and of encephalic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormality, 6 cases (22.2%) of abnormal family history and of abnormal blood biochemistry and blood gas analysis, and 5 cases (18.5%) with skin change and of abnormal hepatic function. Of the 27 cases, 11 cases (19.6%) were diagnosed with inherited metabolic diseases. Among the children in the control group, 3 cases showed abnormal urine test results, one of which had family history, one had hypoevolutism or retrogression of intelligence and motor function, one had brain stem-evoked potential and encephalic CT or MRI abnormality, while two of the 3 cases had inherited metabolic abnormalities. The correlation analysis revealed that abnormal urine test was significantly correlated with inherited metabolic abnormalities (P<0.05). Of the 56 IE patients, 25 cases (44.6%) were identified as abnormal under urine screening, and of the 25 cases, 6 cases had simple generalized seizure (24.0%), 5 cases had simple partial seizure (20.0%), 2 cases had multiple types of seizure (8.0%), and 12 cases had infantile spasms (48.0%). Six cases in the control group showed an abnormal urine test, with 3 cases of simple generalized seizure, 2 cases of simple partial seizure and 1 case of multiple types of seizure. The abnormal urine in infantile spasms was often the risk factor of IE. A total of 46 IE children underwent blood screening and 13 cases were diagnosed as abnormal. In conclusion, inherited metabolic abnormality was a common influential factor in the pathogenesis of IE, especially in infantile spasms.

LNAA passage into the brain is primarily mediated by the complex and dynamic interactions between various solute carrier (SLC) transporters expressed in the neurovascular unit (NVU), among which SLC7A5/LAT1 is considered to be the major contributor in microvascular brain endothelial cells (MBEC). The LAT1-mediated trans-endothelial transport of LNAAs, however, could not be characterized precisely by available in vitro and in vivo standard methods so far. To circumvent these limitations, we have incorporated published in vivo data of rat brain into a robust computational model of NVU-LNAA homeostasis, allowing us to evaluate hypotheses concerning LAT1-mediated trans-endothelial transport of LNAAs across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We show that accounting for functional polarity of MBECs with either asymmetric LAT1 distribution between membranes and/or intrinsic LAT1 asymmetry with low intraendothelial binding affinity is required to reproduce the experimentally measured brain ISF response to intraperitoneal (IP) L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine injection. On the basis of these findings, we have also investigated the effect of IP administrated L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine on the dynamics of LNAAs in MBECs, astrocytes and neurons. Finally, the computational model was shown to explain the trans-stimulation of LNAA uptake across the BBB observed upon ISF perfusion with a competitive LAT1 inhibitor.Keywords: blood brain barrier, neurovascular unit, amino acid transporter, large neutral amino acid, SLC7A5/LAT1",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5859092/,abstract

Here, two case studies are presented that document consideration of placement of children into foster care or kinship homes as a last resort to improve persistently high Phe concentrations. In the first case, social service referral led to a 3-year-old girl being placed in a kinship home with her grandparents, resulting in excellent Phe control thereafter. In the second case, discussion with the parents of possible placement of a 12-year-old child into foster care was sufficient to have a positive effect on Phe control.

Mutations led the way to the discovery of many of the molecular elements of innate immune sensing and signaling pathways. In turn, the need for a faster way to find the molecular causes of mutation-induced phenotypes triggered a huge transformation in forward genetics. During the 1980s and 1990s, many heritable phenotypes were ascribed to mutations through positional cloning. In mice, this required three steps. First, a genetic mapping step was used to show that a given phenotype emanated from a circumscribed region of the genome. Second, a physical mapping step was undertaken, in which all of the region was cloned and its gene content determined. Finally, a concerted search for the mutation was performed. Such projects usually lasted for several years, but could produce breakthroughs in our understanding of biological processes. Publication of the annotated mouse genome sequence in 2002 made physical mapping unnecessary. More recently we devised a new technology for automated genetic mapping, which eliminated both genetic mapping and the search for mutations among candidate genes. The cause of phenotype can now be determined instantaneously. We have created more than 100,000 coding/splicing mutations. And by screening for defects of innate and adaptive immunity we have discovered many “new” proteins needed for innate immune function.Keywords: forward genetics, genetic mapping, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, Toll-like receptor, innate immunity",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5179328/,abstract

The Urea Cycle Disorders Longitudinal Study is a natural history study that collects data from regular clinical follow-up and neuropsychological testing. This report examines links between biochemical markers (ammonia, glutamine, arginine, citrulline) and primary neuropsychological endpoints in 3 distal disorders, argininosuccinic acid synthetase deficiency (ASD or citrullinemia type I), argininosuccinic acid lyase deficiency (ASA or ALD) and arginase deficiency (ARGD). Laboratory results and test scores from neuropsychological evaluations were assessed in 145 study participants, ages 3 years and older, with ASD (n=64), ASA (n=65) and ARGD (n=16). Mean full scale IQ was below the population mean of 100 ± 15 for all groups: (ASD = 79 ± 24; ASA = 71 ± 21; ARGD = 65 ± 19). The greatest deficits were noted in visual performance and motor skills for all groups. While ammonia levels remain prominent as prognostic biomarkers, other biomarkers may be equally valuable as correlates of neuropsychological functioning. Cumulative exposure to the biomarkers included in the study proved to be highly sensitive indicators of neuropsychological outcomes, even when below the cut-off levels generally considered toxic. Blood levels of biomarkers obtained on the day of neuropsychological evaluations were not correlated with measures of functioning for any disorder in any domain. The importance of cumulative exposure supports early identification and confirms the need for well-controlled management of all biochemical abnormalities (and not just ammonia) that occur in urea cycle disorders.Keywords: urea cycle disorders, cognitive outcomes, neuropsychological, argininosuccinic acid synthetase deficiency, argininosuccinic acid lyase deficiency, arginase deficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6041144/,abstract

For the present study executive functioning (EF) was assessed in 21 PKU patients during childhood (T1, mean age 10.4 years, SD = 2.0) and again in adulthood (T2, mean age 25.8 years, SD = 2.3). At T2 additional assessments of EF in daily life and mental health were performed. Childhood (i.e. 0–12 years) blood phenylalanine was significantly related to cognitive flexibility, executive motor control, EF in daily life and mental health in adulthood (i.e. at T2). Patients with a greater increase in phenylalanine levels after the age of 12 performed more poorly on EF-tasks at T2. Group-based analyses showed that patients with phenylalanine <360 µmol/L in childhood and phenylalanine ≥360 µmol/L from age 13 onwards (n = 11) had better cognitive flexibility and executive motor control than those who had phenylalanine ≥360 µmol/L throughout life (n = 7), supporting the notion that phenylalanine should be below the recommended upper treatment target of 360 µmol/L during childhood for better outcome in adulthood. Despite some results indicating additional influence of phenylalanine levels between 13 and 17 years of age, evidence for a continued influence of phenylalanine levels after childhood on adult outcomes was largely lacking. This may be explained by the fact that the patients in the present study had relatively low phenylalanine levels during childhood (mean: 330 µmol/L, range: 219–581 µmol/L) and thereafter (mean Index of Dietary Control at T2: 464 µmol/L, range: 276–743 µmol/L), which may have buffered against transitory periods of poor metabolic control during adolescence and early adulthood.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, Executive functioning, Executive motor control, Mental health, Adults, Longitudinal",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574956/,abstract

The search for deficient brain structures mediating flawed chemosensitivity typically focuses on medullary regions; however, a network that includes Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex and its associated cerebellar nuclei also helps mediate responses to CO2 and O2 challenges, and assists integration of cardiovascular and respiratory interactions. Although cerebellar nuclei contributions to chemoreceptor challenges in adult models are well described, Purkinje cell roles in developing models are unclear. We used a model of developmental cerebellar Purkinje cell loss to determine if such loss influenced compensatory ventilatory responses to hypercapnic and hypoxic challenges. Twenty-four Lurcher mutant mice and wildtype controls were sequentially exposed to 2% increases in CO2 (0%-8%), or 2% reductions in O2 (21%-13%) over four minutes, with return to room air (21% O2 / 79% N2 / 0% CO2) between each exposure. Whole-body plethysmography was used to continuously monitor tidal volume (TV) and breath frequency (f). Increased f to hypercapnia was significantly lower in Mutants, slower to initiate, and markedly lower in compensatory periods, except for very high (8%) CO2 levels. The magnitude of TV changes to increasing CO2 appeared smaller in Mutants, but only approached significance. Smaller, but significant differences emerged in response to hypoxia, with Mutants showing smaller TV when initially exposed to reduced O2, and lower f following exposure to 17% O2. Since cerebellar neuropathology appears in SIDS victims, developmental cerebellar neuropathology may contribute to SIDS vulnerability.Keywords: cerebellum, sudden infant death, autism spectrum disorders, Lurcher, respiration",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462133/,abstract

We tested the potential of different concentrations of several aminoglycosides (AAGs) for promoting PTC-readthrough in 5 genes involved in the pathogenesis of primary ciliary dyskinesia, an inherited disorder caused by the dysfunction of motile cilia and flagella. The efficiency of readthrough stimulation of PTCs cloned in dual reporter vectors was examined in 2 experimental settings: in vitro (transcription/translation system) and ex vivo (transiently transfected epithelial cell line). PTC-readthrough was observed in 5 of the 16 mutations analyzed. UGA codons were more susceptible to AAG-stimulated readthrough than UAG; no suppression of UAA was observed. The efficiency of PTC-readthrough in vitro (from less than 1% to ∼28% of the translation from the corresponding wild-type constructs) differed with the AAG type and concentration, and depended on the combination of AAG and PTC, indicating that each PTC has to be individually tested with a range of stimulating compounds. The maximal values of PTC suppression observed in the ex vivo experiments were, depending on AAG used, 3–5 times lower than the corresponding values in vitro, despite using AAG concentrations that were 2 orders of magnitude higher. This indicates that, while the in vitro system is sufficient to examine the readthrough-susceptibility of PTCs, it is not sufficient to test the compounds potential to stimulate PTC-readthrough in the living cells. Most of the tested compounds (except for G418) at their highest concentrations did not disturb ciliogenesis in the cultures of primary respiratory epithelial cells from healthy donors.KEYWORDS: aminoglycosides, ciliopathy, premature termination codon, primary ciliary dyskinesia, STOP codon suppression, translational readthrough",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5056772/,abstract

Genetics and diet exert a strong influence on the microbiome, and diet is used (alone or as an adjuvant) in the treatment of many IEMs. This review will describe how the effects of the microbiome on the host can interfere with IEM phenotypes through interactions with organs such as the liver and brain, two of the structures most commonly affected by IEMs. The relationships between treatment strategies for some IEMs and the microbiome will also be addressed.

We describe the implementation of a single broad-based NGS sequencing assay to meet the genetic testing needs at the University of Minnesota. A single hybrid capture library preparation was used for each test ordered, data was informatically blinded to clinically-ordered genes, and identified variants were reviewed and classified by genetic counselors and molecular pathologists. We performed 2509 sequencing tests from August 2012 till December 2017. The diagnostic yield has remained steady at 25%, but the number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) included in a patient report decreased over time with 50% of the patient reports including at least one VUS in 2012 and only 22% of the patient reports reporting a VUS in 2017 (p = .002). Among the various clinical specialties, the diagnostic yield was highest in dermatology (60% diagnostic yield) and ophthalmology (42% diagnostic yield) while the diagnostic yield was lowest in gastrointestinal diseases and pulmonary diseases (10% detection yield in both specialties). Deletion/duplication analysis was also implemented in a subset of panels ordered, with 9% of samples having a diagnostic finding using the deletion/duplication analysis.

We have studied amino acid composition and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism at day 6 p.c. in diabetic rabbits and blastocysts. In the plasma of diabetic rabbits the concentrations of 12 amino acids were altered in comparison to the controls. Notably, the concentrations of the BCAA leucine, isoleucine and valine were approximately three-fold higher in diabetic rabbits than in the control. In the cavity fluid of blastocysts from diabetic rabbits BCAA concentrations were twice as high as those from controls, indicating a close link between maternal diabetes and embryonic BCAA metabolism. The expression of BCAA oxidizing enzymes and BCAA transporter was analysed in maternal tissues and in blastocysts. The RNA amounts of three oxidizing enzymes, i.e. branched chain aminotransferase 2 (Bcat2), branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (Bckdha) and dehydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (Dld), were markedly increased in maternal adipose tissue and decreased in liver and skeletal muscle of diabetic rabbits than in those of controls. Blastocysts of diabetic rabbits revealed a higher Bcat2 mRNA and protein abundance in comparison to control blastocysts. The expression of BCAA transporter LAT1 and LAT2 were unaltered in endometrium of diabetic and healthy rabbits, whereas LAT2 transcripts were increased in blastocysts of diabetic rabbits. In correlation to high embryonic BCAA levels the phosphorylation amount of the nutrient sensor mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was enhanced in blastocysts caused by maternal diabetes.

The technique consists of using an RNA guide molecule to bind to complementary DNA sequences, which simultaneously recruits the endonuclease Cas9 to introduce double-stranded breaks in the target DNA. The resulting double-stranded break is then repaired, allowing modification or removal of specific DNA bases. The technique has gained momentum in the laboratory because it is cheap, quick, and easy to use. Moreover, it is also being applied in vivo to generate more complex animal model systems. Such use of genome editing has proven to be highly effective and warrants a potential therapy for both genetic and non-genetic diseases. Although genome editing has the potential to be a transformative therapy for patients it is still in its infancy. Consequently, the legal and ethical frameworks are yet to be fully discussed and will be an increasingly important topic as the technology moves towards more contentious issues such as modification of the germline.

1232,10.1297/cpe.27.67,29662265,"Go to:Abstract.Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element that is involved in numerous biological
processes in the form of a selenoprotein such as iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO). Se
deficiency may prevent the conversion of T4 to T3 through reducing DIO expression and
thereby affecting thyroid hormone status. However, this has not been well documented in
humans. In this study, to clarify the association between Se and thyroid hormone status,
we investigated the thyroid hormone levels in patients with severe Se deficiency (< 2
µg/dl). Severe Se deficiency was associated with increases in free T4 levels, but not with
decreases and increases in free T3 and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels,
respectively. Increases in free T4 levels during Se deficiency were reduced with Se
supplementation; however, neither free T3 nor TSH levels were affected. Taken together,
these findings indicate that free T4 may be a useful biomarker for Se status when serum Se
levels are severely low.Keywords: selenium, thyroid hormone, deiodinase",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5897581/,abstract

MWI was performed on a 3.0T whole body magnetic resonance scanner. Myelin water fraction (MWF) was extracted for the dorsal columns and whole cord. SSEPs and MWF were also compared with conventional MRI outcomes, including T2 signal intensity, compression ratio, maximum spinal cord compression (MSCC), and maximum canal compromise (MCC).Results: Group analysis showed marked differences in T2 signal intensity, compression ratio, MSCC, and MCC between healthy controls and patients with CSM. There were no group differences in MWF and SSEP latencies. However, patients with CSM with pathologic SSEPs exhibited reduction in MWF (p < 0.05). MWF was also correlated with SSEP latencies.Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence of decreased myelin content in the spinal cord associated with impaired spinal cord conduction in patients with CSM. While conventional MRI are of great value to define the extent of cord compression, they show a limited correlation with functional deficits (i.e., delayed SSEPs). MWI provides independent and complementary readouts to spinal cord compression, with a high specificity to detect impaired conduction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5562959/,abstract

The plasma Phe was determined in parallel by HPLC and by image-densitometry of 2D-TLC plates.ResultsTypical examples of 2D-TLC plates and HPLC chromatograms from infants with HPA and PKU are presented and evaluated. The Phe spot was visible on 2D - TLC plates at Phe concentrations higher than 300 µmol/L. The standard calibration curve traced after image-densitometry of the Phe spot presented high dispersion of values at each concentration of Phe, high SD values, the equation of the curve having a low R-squared value (0.862). In contrast, the standard calibration curve obtained by HPLC shows linearity on the range of concentrations from 100 - 16,000 µmol/L, extremely small SD values, the equation of the curve has a very high R-squared value (0.999).ConclusionsThe HPLC methodology is appropriate to confirm HPA detected by newborn or selective screening of PKU.

Newborn mortality and morbidity could be markedly reduced by early diagnosis and treatment of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). Methods of screening for IEM by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) have been developed, and their advantages include rapid testing, high sensitivity, high specificity, high throughput, and low sample volume (a single dried blood spot).MethodsDried blood spots of 100,077 newborns obtained from Jining city in 2014-2015 were screened by MS/MS. The screening results were further confirmed by clinical symptoms and biochemical analysis in combination with the detection of neonatal deficiency in organic acid, amino acid, or fatty acid metabolism and DNA analysis.ResultsThe percentages of males and females among the 100,077 infants were 54.1% and 45.9%, respectively. Cut-off values were established by utilizing the percentile method. The screening results showed that 98,764 newborns were healthy, and 56 out of the 1313 newborns with suspected IEM were ultimately diagnosed with IEM. Among these 56 newborns, 19 (1:5267) had amino acid metabolism disorders, 26 (1:3849) had organic acid metabolism disorders, and 11 (1:9098) had fatty acid oxidation disorders. In addition, 54 patients with IEM were found to carry mutations, and the other 2 patients had argininemia.ConclusionsFifty-six cases of metabolic disorders in Jining were confirmed via newborn screening (NBS) by MS/MS. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for the survival and well-being of affected children. A nationwide NBS program using MS/MS is recommended, especially in poor areas of China.Keywords: Tandem mass spectrometry, Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), Aminoacidemia, Organic acidemia, Fatty acid oxidation disorders",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5850921/,abstract

The purpose of this paper is to examine public responses to the storage and secondary uses of RBS that can be identified through analysis of media, legal cases, and documented public engagement activities. Coverage in the examined print media confirmed the importance of RBS to journalists and those people who expressed their concerns to these journalists. Several lawsuits, brought by parents concerned about the storage of newborn bloodspots, placed the practice of storing NBS into the spotlight. This resulted in controversial debates and the mandatory destruction of millions of samples. Analysis of public engagement activities across several jurisdictions indicated that across (inter)national boundaries there are common elements to what is perceived as inappropriate governance of RBS. Public concerns were grouped into five main themes: trust, transparency, confidentiality, ownership, and stigmatization/discrimination. The results of our analysis help to make a compelling case for placing citizens at the center of the debate and developing policy about the storage and secondary uses of newborn bloodspots.Keywords: Residual newborn bloodspots, Storage, Secondary uses, Public concerns, Public engagement activities, Print media",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4356669/,abstract

Plasma DβH activity, however, was normal and the DBH gene had no mutations. Molecular genetic analysis was performed to determine the underlying genetic cause. Homozygosity mapping and exome and Sanger sequencing revealed pathogenic homozygous mutations in the gene encoding cytochrome b561 (CYB561); a missense variant c.262G>A, p.Gly88Arg in exon 3 in the Dutch family and a nonsense mutation (c.131G>A, p.Trp44*) in exon 2 in the American family. Expression of CYB561 was investigated using RNA from different human adult and fetal tissues, transcription of RNA into cDNA and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The CYB561 gene was found to be expressed in many human tissues, in particular the brain. The CYB561 protein defect leads to a shortage of ascorbate inside the catecholamine secretory vesicles leading to a functional DβH deficiency. The concentration of the catecholamines and downstream metabolites was measured in brain and adrenal tissue of six CYB561 knockout mice (reporter-tagged deletion allele (post-Cre), genetic background C57BL/6NTac). The concentration of norepinephrine and normetanephrine was decreased in whole brain homogenates of the CYB561(−/−) mice compared to wild type mice (p<0.01) and the concentration of normetanephrine and metanephrine was decreased in adrenal glands (p<0.01), recapitulating the clinical phenotype. The patients responded favorably to treatment with L-dihydroxyphenylserine, which can be converted directly to norepinephrine.ConclusionsThis study is the first to implicate cytochrome b561 in disease by showing that pathogenic mutations in CYB561 cause an as yet unknown disease in neurotransmitter metabolism causing orthostatic hypotension.Keywords: Orthostatic hypotension, catecholamines, dopamine β-hydroxylase, CYB561, sympathetic nervous system, hypotensin, low blood pressure, adrenergic regulation, dopamine, genetics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5924476/,abstract

Therefore we compared the predictive value of the neonatal (test I) versus the 48-h BH4 loading test (test II) and long-term BH4 responsiveness.MethodsData on test I (>1991, 20 mg/kg) at T = 8 (n = 85) and T = 24 (n = 5) were collected and compared with test II and long-term BH4 responsiveness at later age, with ≥30 % Phe decrease used as the cut-off.ResultsThe median (IQR) age at hospital diagnosis was 9 (7–11) days and the age at test II was 11.8 (6.6–13.7) years. The baseline Phe concentrations at test I were significantly higher compared to test II (1309 (834–1710) versus 514 (402–689) μmol/L, respectively, P = 0.000). 15/85 patients had a positive test I T = 8. All, except one patient who was not tested for long-term BH4 responsiveness, showed long-term BH4 responsiveness. In 20/70 patients with a negative test I T = 8, long-term BH4 responsiveness was confirmed. Of 5 patients with a test I T = 24, 1/5 was positive at both tests and showed long-term BH4 responsiveness, 2/5 had negative results at both tests and 2/5 showed a negative test I T = 24, but a positive test II with 1/2 showing long-term BH4 responsiveness.ConclusionsBoth a positive neonatal 8- and 24-h BH4 loading test are predictive for long-term BH4 responsiveness. However, a negative test does not rule out long-term BH4 responsiveness.

It was aimed to determine the views and experiences of healthcare professionals (HCPs) and parents on communication and interaction during the period of confirmatory testing following a positive screening result.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were undertaken with parents of children who had received a positive ENBS result and HCPs who had been involved with the diagnosis and support of parents. Ten parents and 11 healthcare professionals took part in the in-depth interviews. Questions considered the journey from the positive screening result through confirmatory testing to a confirmed diagnosis and the communication and interaction between the parents and HCPs that they had been experienced. Key themes were identified through thematic analysis.ResultsThe results point to a number of elements within the path through confirmatory testing that are difficult for parents and could be further developed to improve the experience. These include the way in which the results are communicated to parents, rapid turnaround of results, offering a consistent approach, exploring interventions to support family relationships and reviewing the workload and scheduling implications for healthcare professionals.ConclusionsAs technology enables newborn screening of a larger number of conditions, there is an increasing need to consider and mediate the potentially negative effects on families.

Personalized selection of cancer drugs based on the presence of actionable mutations has become an integral part of cancer therapy. Molecular tests underlie the administration of EGFR, BRAF, ALK, ROS1, PARP inhibitors as well as the use of some other cytotoxic and targeted drugs. Tumors almost always shed their fragments (single cells or their clusters, DNA, RNA, proteins) into various body fluids. So-called liquid biopsy, i.e., the analysis of circulating DNA or some other tumor-derived molecules, holds a great promise for non-invasive monitoring of cancer disease, analysis of drug-sensitizing mutations and early cancer detection.

The canonical yeast models have recently been expanded by the establishment of a model for type II diabetes, a non-neurological amyloid-associated disease. While these model systems require the exogenous expression of mammalian proteins in yeast, an additional amyloid-associated disease model, comprising solely mutations of endogenous yeast genes, has been recently described. Mutated in the adenine salvage pathway, this yeast model exhibits adenine accumulation, thereby recapitulating adenine inborn error of metabolism disorders.

A new shaped filter device for the quick and simple collection of a designated volume of patient blood has been designed and tested against conventional blood spots for accuracy and precision.MethodsShaped filter devices were laser cut from Whatman GB003 paper to absorb a 20 μl blood volume. These devices were used to sample Plasmodium falciparum infected blood and the volume absorbed was measured volumetrically. Conventional blood spots were made by pipetting 20 μl of the same blood onto Whatman 3MM paper. DNA was extracted from both types of dried blood spot using Qiagen DNA blood mini or Chelex extraction for real-time PCR analysis, and PURE extraction for malaria LAMP testing.ResultsThe shaped filter devices collected a mean volume of 21.1 μl of blood, with a coefficient of variance of 8.1%. When used for DNA extraction by Chelex and Qiagen methodologies the mean number of international standard units of P. falciparum DNA recovered per μl of the eluate was 53.1 (95% CI: 49.4 to 56.7) and 32.7 (95% CI: 28.8 to 36.6), respectively for the shaped filter device, and 54.6 (95% CI: 52.1 to 57.1) and 12.0 (95% CI: 9.9 to 14.1), respectively for the 3MM blood spots. Qiagen extraction of 200 μl of whole infected blood yielded 853.6 international standard units of P. falciparum DNA per μl of eluate.ConclusionsA shaped filter device provides a simple way to quickly sample and store a defined volume of blood without the need for any additional measuring devices.

Because liver manganese (Mn) levels decrease in response to PCB126, a Mn dietary study was designed to investigate the role of Mn in PCB126 toxicity. Male Sprague Dawley rats received diets containing 0, 10, or 150 ppm added Mn for 3 weeks, followed by a single ip injection of corn oil or PCB126 (5 µmol/kg body weight). After 2 weeks, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Fe levels in the heart, liver, and liver mitochondria, and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and metallothionein mRNA, MnSOD protein, and MnSOD activity were determined. Mn levels in liver, heart, and liver mitochondria were strongly decreased by the Mn-deficient diet. Small effects on Fe levels and a stepwise increase in MnSOD activity with dietary Mn were also visible. PCB126 caused profound changes in Cu (up), Zn, Fe, and Mn (down) in liver, but not in heart, and differing effects (Cu, Zn, and Fe up, Mn down) in liver mitochondria. Liver MnSOD and metallothionein mRNA levels and MnSOD protein were increased but MnSOD activity was decreased by PCB126.

Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SH2B3 and SMARCA4 were genotyped using MassARRAY technology. Allelic and genotypic models and haplotype frequencies were compared between groups. Logistic regression was used to estimate the CAD risk associated with the genotypes. We found that the “A” alleles in both rs11879293 and rs12232780 of SMARCA4 were associated with CAD risk in men (p = 0.036 and p = 0.001, respectively). The genetic model showed that SH2B3 was associated with CAD susceptibility in both women and men, while SMARCA4 was associated with reduced odds of CAD in men. SH2B3 haplotypes were associated with decreased CAD risk in women (p = 0.007) and increased CAD risk in men (p = 0.047). By providing evidence for the sex-related association between SH2B3 and SMARCA4 gene variants and CAD susceptibility in the Chinese Han population, this study may help define useful diagnostic and preventive markers for these patients.Keywords: coronary artery disease, SH2B3, SMARCA4, single nucleotide polymorphism, gene",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5601741/,abstract

Considering its complexity, the management of PKU may bring a formidable economic burden to parents and caregivers. It is still unknown what the out-of-pocket expenses are for a patient with PKU in China. This paper explores the household financial burden of classical PKU and its impact on Chinese families in a quantitative manner for the first time.MethodsA non-interventional and observational study was conducted at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, one of the national centers for inherited metabolic disorders in China. The medical and non-medical household financial burdens were consolidated into a questionnaire to evaluate the out-of-pocket costs (OOPCs) of PKU treatment and follow-up.FindingsThe total OOPCs were USD$3766.1 (0y), USD$3795.2 (1–2 ys), USD$4657.7 (3–4 ys), USD$5979.9 (5–8 ys), and USD$5588.7 (9 ys and older) for PKU patients of different age groups. The median economic burden of classical PKU was 75.0 % of total annual family income (range 1.0–779.1 %), and 94.4 % of the families exceeding the threshold considered as catastrophic expenditure. There was a negative correlation between the financial burden and the proportion of time when Phe concentrations were in the desired target range (120–250 μmol/L) in 0–4-ys group (r = -0.474, p = 0.026).ConclusionsThe management of PKU is associated with a severe financial burden on patients’ families, which may lead to insufficient treatment or variation of blood Phe concentration. The current reimbursement policies are as yet inadequate.

We identified three hit compounds which show the ability to increase the thermal stability of both the C-terminal domain as well as full-length NPM. The best hit also seemed to favor folding of an AML-like mutant. Computational pocket identification and molecular docking support a stabilization mechanism based on binding of the phenyl/benzene group of the compounds to a particular hydrophobic pocket and additional polar interactions with solvent-accessible residues. Since these results indicate a chaperoning potential of our candidate hits, we tested their effect on the subcellular localization of AML-like mutants.

In the present study, 46 primary caregivers of children with PKU completed measures of psychological distress, parenting stress (related to caring for a child with an illness), resilience, perceived social support and child dependency. Treatment adherence was assessed using the proportion of blood phenylalanine concentrations within target range in the preceding year. Results indicated that 59% of caregivers showed clinical levels of psychological distress, which was predicted by their parenting stress and resilience. Whilst the proportion of blood phenylalanine concentrations in range was not associated with parental distress, it was predicted by child age and caregiver’s perceived support from family. Despite experiencing high levels of distress, the results indicated that caregivers’ ability to adhere to treatment was not affected. Interventions to reduce parenting stress and boost caregiver resilience may have a positive effect on parental wellbeing. Additionally, interventions to promote treatment adherence benefit parents of older children, with a focus on promoting support from family members.

Here, in order to design a rapid and effective method for the genetic diagnosis of AS, we developed a strategy by utilizing targeted capture associated with next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 simultaneously in 20 AS patients. All the coding exons and flanking sequences of COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 from the probands were captured followed by HiSeq 2500 sequencing. Candidate mutations were validated by classic Sanger sequencing and quantitative (q)PCR. Sixteen patients (16/20, 75%) showed X-linked inheritance, and four patients (4/20, 20%) showed autosomal recessive inheritance. None of the individuals had autosomal-dominant AS. Fifteen novel mutations, 6 known mutations, and 2 novel fragment deletions were detected by targeted capture and NGS. Of these novel mutations, 12, 3, and 2 mutations were detected in COL4A5, COL4A4, and COL4A3, respectively. A comparison of the clinical manifestations caused by different types of mutations in COL4A5 suggested that nonsense mutations and glycine substitution by an acidic amino acid are more severe than the other missense mutations.

Given that MARK3 is highly conserved in flies (I: 55%; S: 67%) we knocked down the MARK3 homologue, par-1, in the eye during development. This leads to a significant reduction in eye size, a severe loss of photoreceptors and loss of vision based on electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. Expression of the par-1 p.Arg792Gly mutation (equivalent to the MARK3 variant found in patients) in developing fly eyes also induces loss of eye tissue and reduces the ERG signals. The data in flies and human indicate that the MARK3 variant corresponds to a loss of function.

To date, multiple tests are needed in order to complete a full set of fetus disorder screening, which is costly and time consuming. Therefore, an integrated 3‐in‐1 NIPT approach will be in great demand by routine clinical practice in the near future.MethodsWe designed a target capture sequencing panel with an associate bioinformatics pipeline to create a novel multi‐functional NIPT method and we evaluated its performance by testing 22 clinical samples containing aneuploidy, CNV, and single‐gene disorder. Chromosomal aneuploidy and CNV were detected based on the Z‐value approach, whereas single‐gene disorder was identified by using the “pseudo‐tetraploid” model to estimate the best‐suited genotype for each locus.ResultsThe performance of this newly constructed 3‐in‐1 system was promising. We achieved a 100% detection rate for chromosomal aneuploidies (7/7), a 100% diagnosis rate for fetus CNVs larger than 20 Mb (3/3), and an 86.4% accuracy for single‐gene disorder screening (19/22).ConclusionFor the first time, we showed that it is possible to use just a single NIPT test to detect three distinct types of fetus disorder and laid a foundation for developing a cheaper, faster, and multi‐functional NIPT method in the future.Keywords: chromosome aneuploidy, CNVs, NIPT, single‐gene disorder, target sequencing",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6465655/,abstract

However, it remains unclear why the risks of use of AmED are heightened compared to alcohol alone even when the doses of alcohol consumed are similar. Therefore, the purpose of this laboratory study was to investigate if the rate of self-paced beverage consumption was faster for a dose of AmED versus alcohol alone using a double-blind, within-subjects, placebo-controlled study design. Participants (n = 16) of equal gender who were social drinkers attended 4 separate test sessions that involved consumption of alcohol (1.97 ml/kg vodka) and energy drinks, alone and in combination. On each test day, the dose assigned was divided into 10 cups. Participants were informed that they would have a two hour period to consume the 10 drinks. After the self-paced drinking period, participants completed a cued go/no-go reaction time task and subjective ratings of stimulation and sedation. The results indicated that participants consumed the AmED dose significantly faster (by approximately 16 minutes) than the alcohol dose. For the performance task, participants’ mean reaction times were slower in the alcohol conditions and faster in the energy drink conditions. In conclusion, alcohol consumers should be made aware that rapid drinking might occur for AmED beverages thus heightening alcohol-related safety risks. The fast rate of drinking may be related to the generalized speeding of responses following energy drink consumption.Keywords: Alcohol, Energy drinks, Drinking Rate, Stimulation, Reaction Time",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5344720/,abstract

We have studied monoamine neurotransmitter status and the effect of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) treatment in Pahenu1/enu2 (ENU1/2) mice, a model of partial PAH deficiency. These mice exhibit elevated blood L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) concentrations similar to that of mild hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), but brain levels of L-Phe are still ~5-fold elevated compared to wild-type. We found that brain L-tyrosine, L-tryptophan, BH4 cofactor and catecholamine concentrations, and brain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity were normal in these mice but that brain serotonin, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5HIAA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) content, and brain TH protein, as well as tryptophan hydroxylase type 2 (TPH2) protein levels and activity were reduced in comparison to wild-type mice. Parenteral L-Phe loading conditions did not lead to significant changes in brain neurometabolite concentrations. Remarkably, enteral BH4 treatment, which normalized brain L-Phe levels in ENU1/2 mice, lead to only partial recovery of brain serotonin and 5HIAA concentrations. Furthermore, indirect evidence indicated that the GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) feedback regulatory protein (GFRP) complex may be a sensor for brain L-Phe elevation to ameliorate the toxic effects of HPA. We conclude that BH4 treatment of HPA toward systemic L-Phe lowering reverses elevated brain L-Phe content but the recovery of TPH2 protein and activity as well as serotonin levels is suboptimal, indicating that patients with mild HPA and mood problems (depression or anxiety) treated with the current diet may benefit from supplementation with BH4 and 5-OH-tryptophan.Keywords: Monoamine neurotransmitter, Tyrosine hydroxylase, Tryptophan hydroxylase 2, GTP cyclohydrolase (GTPCH), GTP cyclohydrolase feedback-regulatory protein (GFRP)",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6041158/,abstract

Current interventions are palliative as no treatment improves the long-term outcome. Therefore, new therapeutic modalities with translational potential are urgently needed and abnormalities downstream from the absence of dystrophin are realistic targets. It has been shown that DMD mutations alter extracellular ATP (eATP) signaling via P2RX7 purinoceptor upregulation, which leads to autophagic death of dystrophic muscle cells. Furthermore, the eATP-P2RX7 axis contributes to DMD pathology by stimulating harmful inflammatory responses. We demonstrated recently that genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of P2RX7 in the mdx mouse model of DMD produced functional attenuation of both muscle and non-muscle symptoms, establishing this receptor as an attractive therapeutic target. Central to the argument presented here, this purinergic phenotype affects dystrophic myoblasts. Muscle cells were believed not to be affected at this stage of differentiation, as they do not produce detectable dystrophin protein. Our findings contradict the central hypothesis stating that aberrant dystrophin expression is inconsequential in myoblasts and the DMD pathology results from effects such as sarcolemma fragility, due to the absence of dystrophin, in differentiated myofibres. However, we discuss here the evidence that, already in myogenic cells, DMD mutations produce a plethora of abnormalities, including in cell proliferation, differentiation, energy metabolism, Ca2+ homeostasis and death, leading to impaired muscle regeneration. We hope that this discussion may bring to light further results that will help re-evaluating the established belief.

Methods A cross-sectional study of 277 healthy children from birth to 12 years was conducted. Anthropometric, clinical, and dietary information were recorded. Dried blood spots on a filtered paper were used for measurement by derivatized LC-MS/MS.

In the POUNDS LOST, average-protein diets (15% of daily energy) showed stronger effects than did high-protein diets (25% of daily energy) on reducing concentrations of the diabetes-associated BCAA valine at 6 mo independent of the weight change. In both trials, weight loss was directly related to the concurrent reduction of the BCAAs leucine and isoleucine, the AAAs tyrosine and phenylalanine, and 4 other amino acids. For example, per kilogram of weight loss, there was a 0.04-SD decrease in log tyrosine (∼0.6 μmol/L) in both trials. In addition, we showed that reductions in alanine and the AAA tyrosine were significantly related to improved insulin resistance (measured with the use of the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance), independent of weight loss, in both trials (both P < 0.05). For example, per 1-SD decrease in log tyrosine (∼17 μmol/L), there was a 0.04-SD (∼3%) improvement in insulin resistance in the POUNDS LOST and a 0.13-SD (∼8%) improvement in insulin resistance in the DIRECT.Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential importance of dietary interventions in improving amino acid profiles (i.e., reducing diabetes risk–enhancing amino acid concentrations) along with and beyond weight loss.

Likewise, they are important in the regulation of body temperature, the increase/decrease of blood pressure or intake of nutrition, as well as in the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, hormones and alkaloids. Additionally, it was confirmed that these compounds can be considered as useful biomarkers for the diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of several neuroendocrine and cardiovascular disorders, including neuroendocrine tumours (NET), schizophrenia and Parkinson’s Disease. Due to the fact that BAs are chemically unstable, light-sensitive and possess a high tendency for spontaneous oxidation and decomposition at high pH values, their determination is a real challenge. Moreover, their concentrations in biological matrices are extremely low. These issues make the measurement of BA levels in biological matrices problematic and the application of reliable bioanalytical methods for the extraction and determination of these molecules is needed. This article presents an overview of the most recent trends in the quantification of BAs in human samples with a special focus on liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography (GC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) techniques. Thus, new approaches and technical possibilities applied in these methodologies for the assessment of BA profiles in human samples and the priorities for future research are reported and critically discussed. Moreover, the most important applications of LC, GC and CE in pharmacology, psychology, oncology and clinical endocrinology in the area of the analysis of BAs for the diagnosis, follow-up and monitoring of the therapy of various health disorders are presented and critically evaluated.Keywords: biogenic amines, biomarkers, human samples, liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, non-separation techniques",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6572256/,abstract

During the last few years, the next generation technologies, namely whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS), have given rise to the identification of many new genes for autosomal dominant (ADID), autosomal recessive (ARID) and X‑linked forms of ID (XLID). The prevalence of ID is 1.5–2% for milder forms (IQ < 70) and 0.3–0.5% for more severe forms of ID (IQ < 50). Up to now, about 650 genes for ADID have been reported and it is expected that there are at least 350 genes still unidentified. Although the ADID genes can easily be classified according to the associated clinical findings, e. g. different kind of seizures, abnormal body measurements, an advanced selection of reasonable genes for analyses is challenging. Many different panels for ID genes have been developed for a first diagnostic step, but more meaningful is the use of trio exome sequencing in individuals with sporadic ID. Using trio WES the mutation detection rate for de novo mutations in ID varies from 20 to 60%.Further research is needed for the identification of the remaining ID genes, a deeply understanding of the pathways and the development of therapies for the mostly rare causes of ID.Keywords: Intellectual disability, Autosomal dominant, De novo, Next generation sequencing, Mosaicism",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6223758/,abstract

Combined with information from national health registries they can be used in population-based studies of genetic diseases. DNA extracted from neonatal DBSs can be amplified to obtain micrograms of an otherwise limited resource, referred to as whole-genome amplified DNA (wgaDNA). Here we investigate the robustness of exome sequencing of wgaDNA of neonatal DBS samples. We conducted three pilot studies of seven, eight and seven subjects, respectively. For each subject we analysed a neonatal DBS sample and corresponding adult whole-blood (WB) reference sample. Different DNA sample types were prepared for each of the subjects. Pilot 1: wgaDNA of 2x3.2mm neonatal DBSs (DBS_2x3.2) and raw DNA extract of the WB reference sample (WB_ref). Pilot 2: DBS_2x3.2, WB_ref and a WB_ref replica sharing DNA extract with the WB_ref sample. Pilot 3: DBS_2x3.2, WB_ref, wgaDNA of 2x1.6 mm neonatal DBSs and wgaDNA of the WB reference sample. Following sequencing and data analysis, we compared pairwise variant calls to obtain a measure of similarity—the concordance rate. Concordance rates were slightly lower when comparing DBS vs WB sample types than for any two WB sample types of the same subject before filtering of the variant calls. The overall concordance rates were dependent on the variant type, with SNPs performing best. Post-filtering, the comparisons of DBS vs WB and WB vs WB sample types yielded similar concordance rates, with values close to 100%. WgaDNA of neonatal DBS samples performs with great accuracy and efficiency in exome sequencing. The wgaDNA performed similarly to matched high-quality reference—whole-blood DNA—based on concordance rates calculated from variant calls. No differences were observed substituting 2x3.2 with 2x1.6 mm discs, allowing for additional reduction of sample material in future projects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4835089/,abstract

A qualitative colorimetric test was used as the primary screening method. Colorimetric-positive cases were further tested with a serum confirmatory assay. Gene sequencing was performed for eight children suspected with biotinidase deficiency and for some of their parents. Positive cases were daily supplemented with oral biotin and were followed up for approximately six years.Results: Out of 182,891 newborns screened, 129 were suspected of having biotinidase deficiency. Partial deficiency was confirmed in seven children (one was homozygous for p.D543E) and profound deficiency in one child (homozygous p.H485Q). Thus the incidence was one in 22,861 live births (95% confidence interval 1:13,503 to 1:74,454) for profound and partial biotinidase deficiency combined. Two novel mutations were detected: p.A281V and p.E177K. In silico analysis and estimation of the enzyme activity in the children and their parents showed that p.A281V is pathogenic and p.E177K behaves like p.D444H.Conclusion: The incidence of biotinidase deficiency in newborn screening in Minas Gerais was higher than several international studies. The sample size should be larger for final conclusions. Oral daily biotin apparently precluded clinical symptoms, but it may have been unnecessary in some newborns.Keywords: Biotin, Biotinidase deficiency, Gene sequencing, Neonatal screening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582019/,abstract

There has been no report on cohorts of children with TOF in West Africa. This article describes the pattern and presentation of children diagnosed with TOF patients in a tertiary hospital in sub-Saharan Africa over a 9-year period.MethodsProspective and consecutive review of all subjects with diagnosis of TOF confirmed with echocardiography at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) between January 2007 and December 2015. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Descriptive statistics were presented as percentages or means and standard deviation. Means of normally distributed variables were compared using the Students’ t-test and proportions using Chi-square test. Skewed distributions were analyzed using appropriate non-parametric tests. Level of significance set at P<0.05.ResultsThe prevalence of TOF among children presenting at LASUTH at the study period was 4.9 per 1,000 while its prevalence among those with congenital heart disease was 16.9%. There was a male predominance with a mean age of 50.9±45.9 (months) and median age of 36 months. Most children presented within 1–5 years of age.

Plant sterols as well as cholesterol and its precursors were determined in the free and esterified form; lanosterol in the free form only. Metabolites and esterification ratios were compared to the model for early allograft function scoring (MEAF) which is calculated at day 3 post-LTX from routine parameters defining EAD.ResultsThe hepatic esterification ratio of all sterols, but not amino acids and acylcarnitine concentrations, showed substantial metabolic disturbances post-LTX and correlated to the MEAF. In ROC analysis, the low esterification ratio of β-sitosterol and stigmasterol from day 1 and of the other sterols from day 3 were predictive for a high MEAF, i.e. EAD. Additionally, the ratio of esterified β-sitosterol and free lanosterol were predictive for all days and the esterification ratio of the other sterols at day 3 or 4 post-LTX for 3-month mortality.ConclusionLow ratios of circulating esterified sterols are associated with a high risk of EAD and impaired clinical outcome in the early postoperative phase following LTX.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11306-016-1129-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Liver transplantation, Sterol metabolism, MEAF",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5078158/,abstract

Sites where mutations occur with higher frequency than would be expected by chance are termed hotspots while sites that contain mutations rarely are termed coldspots. Mutations are permanently scanned and repaired by repair systems. Among them, the mismatch repair targets base pair mismatches, which are discriminated from canonical base pairs by probing altered elasticity of DNA. Using biased molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the elasticity of coldspots and hotspots motifs detected in human genes associated with inherited disorders, and also of motifs with Czech population hotspots and de novo mutations. Main attention was paid to mutations leading to G/T and A+/C pairs. We observed that hotspots without CpG/CpHpG sequences are less flexible than coldspots, which indicates that flexible sequences are more effectively repaired. In contrary, hotspots with CpG/CpHpG sequences exhibited increased flexibility as coldspots. Their mutability is more likely related to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines leading to C > T mutations, which are primarily targeted by base excision repair. We corroborated conclusions based on computer simulations by measuring melting curves of hotspots and coldspots containing G/T mismatch.Keywords: DNA bending, Muts protein, mutations, hotspots–coldspots, free energy calculations",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6704406/,abstract

Affected patients show multiple disease phenotypes, including dilated cardiomyopathy, exercise intolerance, and hepatopathy, reflecting the central role of the enzyme in glucose metabolism. We present here the first in vitro biochemical characterization of 13 missense mutations involved in PGM1 deficiency. The biochemical phenotypes of the PGM1 mutants cluster into two groups: those with compromised catalysis and those with possible folding defects. Relative to the recombinant wild-type enzyme, certain missense mutants show greatly decreased expression of soluble protein and/or increased aggregation. In contrast, other missense variants are well behaved in solution, but show dramatic reductions in enzyme activity, with kcat/Km often <1.5% of wild-type. Modest changes in protein conformation and flexibility are also apparent in some of the catalytically impaired variants. In the case of the G291R mutant, severely compromised activity is linked to the inability of a key active site serine to be phosphorylated, a prerequisite for catalysis.

Most of the patients are compound heterozygotes, and genotype is a major factor in determining the phenotypic variability of PKU. More than 1,000 variants have been described in the PAH gene. Rio de Janeiro's population has a predominance of Iberian, followed by African and Amerindian ancestries. It is expected that most PKU variants in this Brazilian state have originated in the Iberian Peninsula. However, rare European, African or pathogenic variants that are characteristic of the admixed population of the state might also be found.MethodsA total of 102 patients were included in this study. Genomic DNA was isolated from dried blood spots. Sanger sequencing was used for PAH gene variant identification. Deletions and duplications were also screened using MLPA analysis. Haplotypes were also determined.ResultsNine (8.8%) homozygous and 93 (91.2%) compound heterozygous patients were found. The spectrum included 37 causative mutations. Missense, nonsense, and splicing pathogenic variants corresponded to 63.7%, 2.9%, and 22.6% of the mutant alleles, respectively. Large (1.5%), and small deletions, inframe (5.4%) and with frameshift (3.9%), comprised the remainder. The most frequent pathogenic variants were: p.V388M (12.7%), p.R261Q (11.8%), IVS10‐11G>A (10.3%), IVS2+5G>C (6.4%), p.S349P (6.4%), p.R252W (5.4%), p.I65T (4.4%), p.T323del (4.4%), and p.P281L (3.4%).

As a result, major Black-White differences exist in the baseline and response of cortisol. Yet, the potential association between baseline religiosity and subsequent cortisol levels of Blacks are not known.Objectives:In the current study we aimed to determine the association between baseline religious behaviors and daytime salivary cortisol level among male and female Black youth.Materials and Methods:With a longitudinal design, data came from wave 1 (1994) and wave 6 (2000) of a cohort from an urban area in the Midwest of the United States. The study followed 227 Black adolescents (109 males and 118 females) for six years. Socio-demographics and religious behaviors (frequency of participation in religious activities) were measured at baseline. Base morning cortisol level at wave 6 was the outcome. We fitted a linear regression model to test the association between baseline religiosity at wave 1 and cortisol level at wave 6, while baseline age, socio-economics, and psychological symptoms were controlled.Results:In the pooled sample, frequency of participation in religious activities at baseline was negatively associated with mean cortisol level at follow up (r = -0.29, P > 0.01) among all, males (r = -0.38, P > 0.01), but not females (r = -.20, P > 0.05). Frequency of participation in religious activities remained a significant predictor of subsequent cortisol level (b = -0.283, 95% CI = -.107 - -0.022) while the effect of age, socioeconomics, and psychological symptoms were controlled.

Although gadolinium-associated systemic fibrosis is a rare condition, the threat of litigation has vastly altered clinical practice. Most theories concerning the etiology of the fibrosis are grounded in case reports rather than experiment.

We aimed to assess the effects of imbalanced branched-chain amino acid intake on metabolic and growth parameters in a cohort of MMA patients ascertained via a natural history study.METHODSCross-sectional anthropometric and body composition measurements were correlated with diet content and disease-related biomarkers in 61 patients with isolated MMA (46 mut, 9 cblA and 6 cblB).RESULTSPatients with MMA tolerated close to the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of complete protein (mut0: 99.45 ± 32.05% RDA). However, 85% received medical foods, the protein-equivalent in which often exceeded complete protein intake (35%). Medical food consumption resulted in low plasma valine and isoleucine concentrations, prompting paradoxical supplementation with these propiogenic amino acids. Weight and height–for age Z-scores correlated negatively with the leucine/valine intake ratio (r=−0.453, P=0.014, R2=0.209 and r=−0.341, P=0.05, R2=0.123, respectively).CONCLUSIONIncreased leucine intake in patients with MMA resulted in iatrogenic amino acid deficiencies and was associated with adverse growth outcomes.

Here I demonstrate how such mutational robustness can prevent the discovery of genetic disease determinants. To make my case, I use a mathematical model of the insulin signaling pathway implicated in type 2 diabetes, whose signaling output is governed by 15 genetically determined parameters. Using multiple complementary measures of a parameter’s importance for this phenotype, I show that any one disease determinant that is crucial in one genetic background will be virtually irrelevant in other backgrounds. In an evolving population that drifts through the parameter space of this or other robust circuits through DNA mutations, the genetic changes that can cause disease will vary randomly over time. I call this phenomenon causal drift. It means that mutations causing disease in one (human or non-human) population may have no effect in another population, and vice versa.

Both studies used similar protocol, centralized echocardiographic interpretation and measures expressed as Z-scores referenced to healthy controls. Associations between HAART exposure and echocardiographic measures were evaluated using generalized estimating equations.ResultsComparing the HAART exposed and HAART unexposed groups, any HAART exposure was positively associated with left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening (Z-score for difference = 1.07; p = 0.02) and HAART exposure duration (Z-score difference per year = 0.17; p = 0.003. LV mass was negatively associated with any HAART exposure (Z-score difference = −0.64; p = 0.01) as was septal thickness (Z-score difference = −0.93; p = 0.001). Duration of HAART exposure was negatively associated with LV end-systolic dimension and heart rate (Z-score difference per year= −0.11; p = 0.05 and Z-score difference per year= −0.10; p = 0.002, respectively). During 11 years of follow-up, in the HAART-exposed group, LV mass and LV end-diastolic septal thickness were lower while LV contractility and LV fractional shortening were higher when compared to the HAART-unexposed group.ConclusionsCardiac structure and function were better in perinatally HIV-infected children exposed to HAART than in those of similar children from the pre-HAART era but did decline over time.

Progressive sensorineural hearing loss is the most prominent adverse outcome of both symptomatic and asymptomatic CMV infections in infants. We report the case of a three-month-old baby who presented with complaints of progressive jaundice for three months and a two days history of fever associated with one episode of fits. The baby was diagnosed with congenital CMV infection on the basis of positive CMV IgM and IgG and positive maternal serum CMV IgG. Finding a murmur on physical examination prompted echocardiography which revealed Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). The child was managed with a 6-week course of ganciclovir after which his symptoms improved and he was referred to cardiology for the evaluation of his heart defect. Follow-ups at the clinic have shown normal growth and development. This is the first reported association of cCMV infection with TOF. This case highlights the need to consider the possibility of the presence of heart defects in all infants with cCMV infection in addition to neurodevelopmental abnormalities.

While untargeted metabolite profiling can measure thousands of signals in a single experiment, many biologically meaningful signals cannot be readily identified as known metabolites nor compared across datasets, making it difficult to infer biology and to conduct well-powered meta-analyses across studies. To overcome these challenges, we developed a suite of computational methods, PAIRUP-MS, to match metabolite signals across mass spectrometry-based profiling datasets and to generate metabolic pathway annotations for these signals. To pair up signals measured in different datasets, where retention times (RT) are often not comparable or even available, we implemented an imputation-based approach that only requires mass-to-charge ratios (m/z). As validation, we treated each shared known metabolite as an unmatched signal and showed that PAIRUP-MS correctly matched 70–88% of these metabolites from among thousands of signals, equaling or outperforming a standard m/z- and RT-based approach. We performed further validation using genetic data: the most stringent set of matched signals and shared knowns showed comparable consistency of genetic associations across datasets. Next, we developed a pathway reconstitution method to annotate unknown signals using curated metabolic pathways containing known metabolites. We performed genetic validation for the generated annotations, showing that annotated signals associated with gene variants were more likely to be enriched for pathways functionally related to the genes compared to random expectation. Finally, we applied PAIRUP-MS to study associations between metabolites and genetic variants or body mass index (BMI) across multiple datasets, identifying up to ~6 times more significant signals and many more BMI-associated pathways compared to the standard practice of only analyzing known metabolites. These results demonstrate that PAIRUP-MS enables analysis of unknown signals in a robust, biologically meaningful manner and provides a path to more comprehensive, well-powered studies of untargeted metabolomics data.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347288/,abstract

However, the results concerning aggregation propensity of non-amyloidogenic proteins have not been convincing due to the contrasting effect on holo-LA, which despite being a non-amyloidogenic protein was observed to aggregate under crowded conditions. In the present study, we have extensively characterized the crowding-induced holo-LA aggregates and investigated the possible mechanism responsible for the aggregation process. We discovered that macromolecular crowding reduces the calcium binding affinity of holo-LA resulting in the formation of apo-LA (the calcium-depleted form of holo-LA) leading to aggregate formation. Another finding is that calcium acts as a chaperone capable of inhibiting and dissociating crowding-induced holo-LA aggregates.

Reports on the impact of maternal education programs based on this widely available, inexpensive, and instant communication tool are sparse.ObjectiveThis study aimed to explore the impact of a maternal education program through text messaging.MethodsWe conducted a cluster randomized trial in a remote region in the Chinese province of Hunan between October 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012. We used county as the unit of randomization (a total of 10 counties), with half of the counties randomly allocated to the intervention arm (with maternal education material adapted from the World Health Organization being delivered by text messaging to village health workers and pregnant women alike) and the other half to the control arm (normal care without text messaging). Data on maternal and infant health outcomes and health behaviors were collected and compared between the 2 arms, with maternal and perinatal mortality as the primary outcomes.ResultsA total of 13,937 pregnant women completed the follow-up and were included in the final analysis. Among them, 6771 were allocated to the intervention arm and 6966 were allocated to the control arm. At the county level, the mean (SD) of maternal mortality and perinatal mortality rate were 0.0% (0.1) and 1.3% (0.6), respectively, in the intervention arm and 0.1% (0.2) and 1.5% (0.4), respectively, in the control arm.

It is of particular interest in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as sleep disorders are highly prevalent and have a significant impact on both cognitive and behavioral functions. As polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for the assessment of sleep, is difficult to perform in children with ASD, ACT has become a tool of choice but has not yet been validated against PSG using state-of-the-art methodology. The main objective of this study was to assess, for the first time, the validity of ACT compared to PSG for the measurement of sleep in children with ASD. During the same night of hospitalization, PSG and ACT were conducted in 26 children (6 girls and 20 boys; mean age 5.4 years ± 1.6) diagnosed with ASD according to DSM-5 criteria and standardized diagnostic scales. Sleep parameters were total sleep time (TST), sleep latency (SL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE). To compare PSG and ACT, we conducted sleep parameter agreement analyses including: intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman plots, and equivalence tests. The comparison also included an epoch-by-epoch (EBE) agreement analysis to determine sensitivity (ability to detect sleep) and specificity (ability to detect wake). According to equivalence tests, the difference between ACT and PSG measures was clinically acceptable for TST (<30 min, p < 0.01), SL (<15 min, p < 0.001), and SE (10%, p < 0.01), but not for WASO (<15 min, p = 0.13). There was a good agreement between methods for SL (ICC = 0.79) and TST (ICC = 0.85) and a moderate agreement for WASO (ICC = 0.73) and SE (ICC = 0.68). The EBE agreement analysis revealed a high sensitivity (0.94 ± 0.06) and moderate specificity (0.5 ± 0.2). Since sleep disorders are one of the most common comorbidities within the ASD population and are highly prevalent, it is essential to validate objective tools of assessment. To our knowledge, our study is the first to validate ACT compared to PSG, using a state-of-the-art methodology, in children with ASD.

Pegvaliase is an enzyme substitution therapy that reduces blood Phe levels in patients with PKU and is associated with a risk of hypersensitivity reactions.ObjectiveTo define the minimum acceptable benefit (MAB) of pegvaliase, i.e., the minimum probability of achieving a blood Phe level <360 μmol/L, which patients require to tolerate the risks of hypersensitivity associated with pegvaliase.MethodsAdult, pegvaliase-naïve patients with blood Phe levels >600 μmol/L participated in a patient-preference web survey using two surveys: adapted swing-weighting and thresholding. Participants were asked to make ordinal choices between varying clinical benefit and severity levels for hypersensitivity. Disease effects and treatment satisfaction were also assessed.ResultsAmong 45 participants, the mean (standard deviation) self-reported blood Phe level was 976.9 (429.9) μmol/L; only 28.8% reported satisfaction with their current treatment. Most (84.4%) indicated difficulty in following a PKU diet; 60% reported that the PKU diet was burdensome, and 58% reported feeling socially isolated. Most (≥69%) reported their MAB to be less than the expected clinical benefit provided by pegvaliase; the mean MAB was 22.7% and 34.4% in the swing-weighting and thresholding surveys, respectively.ConclusionMost participants felt the burden of PKU on their daily lives, were dissatisfied with current treatments, and were willing to accept the risks of hypersensitivity reactions to achieve recommended blood Phe levels with pegvaliase treatment.Keywords: Phenylketonuria, PKU, Pegvaliase, Minimum acceptable benefit, Benefit-risk analysis, Patient preferenceAbbreviations: ANOVA, analysis of variance; FDA, Food and Drug Administration; IgE, immunoglobin E; MAB, minimum acceptable benefit; Phe, phenylalanine; PKU, phenylketonuria; SD, standard deviation; SE, standard error",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6722251/,abstract

However, toxicity and/or lack of efficacy are produced when unintended targets are affected in metabolic networks. Thus, identification of biological targets which can be manipulated to produce the desired effect with minimum side-effects has become an important and challenging topic. Efficient computational methods are required to identify the drug targets while incurring minimal side-effects.ResultsIn this paper, we propose a graph-based computational damage model that summarizes the impact of enzymes on compounds in metabolic networks. An efficient method based on Integer Linear Programming formalism is then developed to identify the optimal enzyme-combination so as to minimize the side-effects. The identified target enzymes for known successful drugs are then verified by comparing the results with those in the existing literature.ConclusionsSide-effects reduction plays a crucial role in the study of drug development. A graph-based computational damage model is proposed and the theoretical analysis states the captured problem is NP-completeness.

We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) for the last 20 years in Cushing’s Syndrome (CS) to illustrate Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) challenges, and show what solutions were found.PROs and other Clinical Outcome Assessment (COA) used with CS patients were reviewed in 36 studies. Two CS-specific Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) measures were identified (i.e., CushingQoL, Tuebingen CD-25), as well as depression and neurocognitive measures. For CS-specific HRQL measures, the CushingQoL was the most widely used measure due in part to being the first CS-specific HRQL measure developed. With algorithms mapping the CushingQoL to both the SF-6D and EQ-5D, the CushingQoL could be used to facilitate economic modelling studies in the absence of a generic HRQL measure. While the CushingQoL offers only the global scale and two subscales compared to the six subscales of the Tuebingen CD-25, there is not yet adequate statistical validation data available for the Tuebingen CD-25 to suggest it can withstand the scrutiny of review by multiple stakeholders. Results of this review indicate that the inclusion of a measure of depressive symptoms, such as the BDI-II or similar measure, would be reasonable to include given the high level of comorbidity of depression among CS patients. A brief neurocognitive performance outcome, such as Trail Making tasks A and D or Digit Symbol, could help inform the interpretation of HRQL results. Neurocognitive differences may be an unassessed mediator of HRQL outcomes, partly accounting for the persistence of depressive symptoms and HRQL deficits despite treatment. Results suggest that HRQL improvements are possible within this population. These results are limited by small sample sizes and pre/post study design.CS showcases the difficulties encountered in measuring PROs in rare diseases. A solution for this specific case was developed in the form of dedicated PRO instruments, the CushingQOL and the Tuebingen-25.

Hence, the present study was undertaken to compare indirect cyanmethaemoglobin method against the conventional direct method for haemoglobin estimation.Methods:Haemoglobin levels were estimated for 888 adolescent girls aged 11-18 yr residing in an urban slum in Delhi by both direct and indirect cyanmethaemoglobin methods, and the results were compared.Results:The mean haemoglobin levels for 888 whole blood samples estimated by direct and indirect cyanmethaemoglobin method were 116.1 ± 12.7 and 110.5 ± 12.5 g/l, respectively, with a mean difference of 5.67 g/l (95% confidence interval: 5.45 to 5.90, P<0.001); which is equivalent to 0.567 g%. The prevalence of anaemia was reported as 59.6 and 78.2 per cent by direct and indirect methods, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of indirect cyanmethaemoglobin method were 99.2 and 56.4 per cent, respectively. Using regression analysis, prediction equation was developed for indirect haemoglobin values.Interpretation & conclusions:The present findings revealed that indirect cyanmethaemoglobin method overestimated the prevalence of anaemia as compared to the direct method. However, if a correction factor is applied, indirect method could be successfully used for estimating true haemoglobin level. More studies should be undertaken to establish agreement and correction factor between direct and indirect cyanmethaemoglobin methods.Keywords: Adolescent girls, anaemia, direct cyanmethaemoglobin, indirect cyanmethaemoglobin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5345303/,abstract

We previously described a liver culture system that uses liver-derived hemodynamic blood flow and transport parameters to restore and maintain primary human hepatocyte biology and metabolism utilizing physiologically relevant milieu concentrations.MethodsIn this study, primary hepatocytes isolated from the explanted liver of an 8-year-old PA patient were cultured in the liver system for 10 days and evaluated for retention of differentiated polarized morphology. The expression of PCCA and PCCB was assessed at a gene and protein level relative to healthy donor controls. Ammonia and urea levels were measured in the presence and absence of amino acid supplements to assess the metabolic consequences of branched-chain amino acid metabolism in this disease.ResultsPrimary hepatocytes from the PA patient maintained a differentiated polarized morphology (peripheral actin staining) over 10 days of culture in the system. We noted lower levels of PCCA and PCCB relative to normal healthy controls at the mRNA and protein level. Supplementation of branched-chain amino acids, isoleucine (5 mM) and valine (5 mM) in the medium, resulted in increased ammonia and decreased urea in the PA patient hepatocyte system, but no such response was seen in healthy hepatocytes or patient-derived fibroblasts.ConclusionsWe demonstrate for the first time the successful culture of PA patient-derived primary hepatocytes in a differentiated state, that stably retain the PCCA and PCCB enzyme defects at a gene and protein level. Phenotypic response of the system to an increased load of branched-chain amino acids, not possible with fibroblasts, underscores the utility of this system in the better understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of PA and examining the effectiveness of potential therapeutic agents in the most relevant tissue.Keywords: Organic acidemia, Propionic acidemia, Ammonia, Urea, Hepatocyte, Hemodynamic flow",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852394/,abstract

Oats are expressed in many tissues, including kidney, liver, choroid plexus, olfactory mucosa, brain, retina, and placenta. Recent metabolomics and microarray data from Oat1 [Slc22a6, originally identified as NKT (novel kidney transporter)] and Oat3 (Slc22a8) knockouts, as well as systems biology studies, indicate that this pathway plays a central role in the metabolism and handling of gut microbiome metabolites as well as putative uremic toxins of kidney disease. Nuclear receptors and other transcription factors, such as Hnf4α and Hnf1α, appear to regulate the expression of certain Oats in conjunction with phase I and phase II drug metabolizing enzymes. Some Oats have a strong selectivity for particular signaling molecules, including cyclic nucleotides, conjugated sex steroids, odorants, uric acid, and prostaglandins and/or their metabolites. According to the “Remote Sensing and Signaling Hypothesis,” which is elaborated in detail here, Oats may function in remote interorgan communication by regulating levels of signaling molecules and key metabolites in tissues and body fluids. Oats may also play a major role in interorganismal communication (via movement of small molecules across the intestine, placental barrier, into breast milk, and volatile odorants into the urine). The role of various Oat isoforms in systems physiology appears quite complex, and their ramifications are discussed in the context of remote sensing and signaling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4281586/,abstract

Age-related changes, as well as those associated with disease progression, often appear first in the cutaneous circulation. Furthermore, impaired vascular signaling and attendant endothelial dysfunction, the earliest indicators of cardiovascular pathogenesis, occur in a similar fashion across multiple tissue beds throughout the body, including the skin. Because microvascular dysfunction is a better predictor of long-term outcomes and adverse cardiovascular events than is large vessel disease, an understanding of age-associated changes in the control of the human cutaneous microcirculation is important. This review focuses on 1) the merits of using skin-specific methods and techniques to study vascular function, 2) microvascular changes in aged skin (in particular, the role of the endothelial-derived dilator nitric oxide), and 3) the impact of aging on heat-induced changes in skin vasodilation. While skin blood flow is controlled by multiple, often redundant, mechanisms, our laboratory has used a variety of distinct thermal provocations of this model circulation to isolate specific age-associated changes in vascular function. Skin-specific approaches and techniques, such as intradermal microdialysis coupled with laser-Doppler flowmetry (in vivo) and biochemical analyses of skin biopsy samples (in vitro), have allowed for the targeted pharmacodissection of the mechanistic pathways controlling skin vasoreactivity and study of the impact of aging and disease states.

Nutrient deficiencies may occur due to strict diet. This study is aimed at evaluating the dietary intake and blood concentrations of micronutrients and essential fatty acids (FA), bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture history in patients on long-term dietary treatment.MethodsSixty early diagnosed Dutch patients (aged 1–39 years) were included in a multi-center cross-sectional study. Their dietary intake, blood concentrations of micronutrients, FA, fracture history and BMD were assessed.ResultsSelenium dietary intake and serum concentrations were low in 14 and 46% of patients, respectively. The serum 25-OH vitamin D2 + D3 concentration was low in 14% of patients while 20% of patients had a low vitamin D intake. Zinc serum concentrations were below normal in 14% of patients, despite adequate intake. Folic acid serum concentrations and intake were elevated. Despite safe total protein and fat intake, arginine plasma concentrations and erythrocyte eicosapentaenoic acid were below reference values in 19 and 6% of patients, respectively. Low BMD (Z-score <-2) was slightly more prevalent in patients, but the lifetime fracture prevalence was comparable to the general population.ConclusionsDutch patients with PKU on long-term dietary treatment have a near normal nutrient status.

Congenital microcephaly is present at birth, whereas postnatal microcephaly occurs later in life. Genetic abnormalities, syndromes, metabolic disorders, teratogens, infections, prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal injuries can cause both congenital and postnatal microcephaly. Evaluation of patients with microcephaly begins with a thorough history and physical examination. In cases of worsening microcephaly or neurological signs or symptoms, neuroimaging, metabolic, or genetic testing should be strongly considered. Any further studies and workup should be directed by the presence of signs or symptoms pointing to an underlying diagnosis and are usually used as confirmatory testing for certain conditions. Neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often the first diagnostic test in evaluating children with microcephaly. Genetic testing is becoming more common and is often the next step following neuroimaging when there is no specific evidence in the history or physical examination suggesting a diagnosis. Microcephaly is a lifelong condition with no known cure. The prognosis is usually worse for children who experienced an intrauterine infection or have a chromosomal or metabolic abnormality. Zika virus has rapidly spread since 2015, and maternal infection with this virus is associated with microcephaly and other serious brain abnormalities.

Each athlete who had had multiple symptomatic concussions and repetitive sub concussive trauma during their career was assessed by an experienced neuropsychologist. All athletes had clinical symptoms including headaches, memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, aggression, and depression. Five healthy men, age and weight matched to the athlete cohort and with no history of brain trauma, were recruited as controls. Data were collected from the posterior cingulate gyrus using a 3 T clinical magnetic resonance scanner equipped with a 32 channel head coil.ResultsThe variation of the method was calculated by repeated examination of a healthy control and phantom and found to be 10% and 5%, respectively, or less. The L-COSY measured large and statistically significant differences (P ≤0.05), between healthy controls and those athletes with RBT. Men with RBT showed higher levels of glutamine/glutamate (31%), choline (65%), fucosylated molecules (60%) and phenylalanine (46%). The results were evaluated and the sample size of five found to achieve a significance level P = 0.05 and a power of 90%. Differences in N-acetyl aspartate and myo-inositol between RBT and controls were small and were not statistically significance.ConclusionsA study of a small cohort of professional athletes, with a history of RBT and symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy when compared with healthy controls using 2D L-COSY, showed elevations in brain glutamate/glutamine and choline as recorded previously for early traumatic brain injury.

While studies have explored the acceptability of expanded newborn screening to the general public, the views of affected families have been largely overlooked. This is in spite of the potential for direct impacts on them and their unique positioning to consider the value of early diagnosis. We have previously reported data on attitudes toward pre‐conception and prenatal genetic screening for SMA among affected families (adults with SMA [n = 82] and family members [n = 255]). Here, using qualitative interview [n = 36] and survey data [n = 337], we report the views of this same cohort toward newborn screening. The majority (70%) of participants were in favor, however, all subgroups (except adults with type II) preferred pre‐conception and/or prenatal screening to newborn screening. Key reasons for newborn screening support were: (1) the potential for improved support; (2) the possibility of enrolling pre‐symptomatic children on clinical trials. Key reasons for non‐support were: (1) concerns about impact on the early experiences of the family; (2) inability to treat. Importantly, participants did not view the potential for inaccurate typing as a significant obstacle to the launch of a population‐wide screening program. This study underscores the need to include families affected by genetic diseases within consultations on screening.

In the field of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), a diverse spectrum of targeted biochemical assays is employed to analyze a limited amount of metabolites. We now present a single-platform, high-resolution liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight (LC-QTOF) method that can be applied for holistic metabolic profiling in plasma of individual IEM-suspected patients. This method, which we termed “next-generation metabolic screening” (NGMS), can detect >10,000 features in each sample. In the NGMS workflow, features identified in patient and control samples are aligned using the “various forms of chromatography mass spectrometry (XCMS)” software package. Subsequently, all features are annotated using the Human Metabolome Database, and statistical testing is performed to identify significantly perturbed metabolite concentrations in a patient sample compared with controls. We propose three main modalities to analyze complex, untargeted metabolomics data. First, a targeted evaluation can be done based on identified genetic variants of uncertain significance in metabolic pathways. Second, we developed a panel of IEM-related metabolites to filter untargeted metabolomics data. Based on this IEM-panel approach, we provided the correct diagnosis for 42 of 46 IEMs. As a last modality, metabolomics data can be analyzed in an untargeted setting, which we term “open the metabolome” analysis. This approach identifies potential novel biomarkers in known IEMs and leads to identification of biomarkers for as yet unknown IEMs. We are convinced that NGMS is the way forward in laboratory diagnostics of IEMs.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s10545-017-0131-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Metabolomics, Biomarkers, High-resolution, QTOF, Mass spectrometry, Innovative laboratory diagnostics, Inborn errors of metabolism, Canavan disease, Xanthinuria",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5959972/,abstract

The most extensively studied members are RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. In the last few decades, studies have demonstrated that Rho family GTPases are important regulatory molecules that link surface receptors to the organization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Indeed, Rho GTPases mediate many diverse critical cellular processes, such as gene transcription, cell–cell adhesion, and cell cycle progression. However, Rho GTPases also play an essential role in regulating neuronal morphology. In particular, Rho GTPases regulate dendritic arborization, spine morphogenesis, growth cone development, and axon guidance. In addition, more recent efforts have underscored an important function for Rho GTPases in regulating neuronal survival and death. Interestingly, Rho GTPases can exert either a pro-survival or pro-death signal in neurons depending upon both the cell type and neurotoxic insult involved. This review summarizes key findings delineating the involvement of Rho GTPases and their effectors in the regulation of neuronal survival and death.

Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a critical cofactor required for NO generation, and decreases in BH4 as a result of increases in oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. As male SHR are known to have higher levels of oxidative stress compared with female SHR, we hypothesized that relative BH4 deficiency induced by oxidative stress in male SHR results in lower levels of NOS activity in renal IM compared with females. Twelve-week-old male and female SHR were randomized to receive tempol (30 mg/kg/day via drinking water) or vehicle for 2 weeks. Tempol treatment did not affect blood pressure (BP) in either sex, but reduced peroxynitrite levels only in males. Females had more total biopterin, dihydrobiopterin (BH2), and BH4 levels in renal IMs than males, and tempol treatment eliminated these sex differences. Females had greater total NOS activity in the renal IM than males, and adding exogenous BH4 to the assay increased NOS activity in both sexes. This sex difference in total NOS and the effect of exogenous BH4 were abolished with tempol treatment. We conclude that higher oxidative stress in male SHR results in a relative deficiency of BH4 compared with females, resulting in diminished renal NOS activity in the male.Keywords: hypertension, kidney, nitric oxide, sex",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6028750/,abstract

As is the case in all invertebrates, mussels lack an adaptive immune system, but they respond to pathogens, injuries or environmental stress in a very efficient manner. However, it is not known if they are able to modify their immune response when they reencounter the same pathogen. In this work, we studied the transcriptomic response of mussel hemocytes before and after two consecutive sublethal challenges with Vibrio splendidus. The first exposure significantly regulated genes related to inflammation, migration and response to bacteria. However, after the second exposure, the differentially expressed genes were related to the control and inhibition of ROS production and the resolution of the inflammatory response. Our results also show that the second injection with V. splendidus led to changes at the transcriptional (control of the expression of pro-inflammatory transcripts), cellular (shift in the hemocyte population distribution), and functional levels (inhibition of ROS production). These results suggest that a modified immune response after the second challenge allowed the mussels to tolerate rather than fight the infection, which minimized tissue damage.Keywords: Mytilus galloprovincialis, Vibrio splendidus, hemocyte, RNA-Seq, immune priming, ROS, inflammation, apoptosis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6697025/,abstract

However, lately, ambient temperature preservation has been evaluated by several independent institutions that see economic and logistic advantages in getting rid of the cold chain. Here we validated a novel procedure for ambient temperature preservation of DNA in white blood cell and buffy coat lysates based on the confinement of the desiccated biospecimens under anoxic and anhydrous atmosphere in original hermetic minicapsules. For this validation we stored encapsulated samples either at ambient temperature or at several elevated temperatures to accelerate aging. We found that DNA extracted from stored samples was of good quality with a yield of extraction as expected. Degradation rates were estimated from the average fragment size of denatured DNA run on agarose gels and from qPCR reactions. At ambient temperature, these rates were too low to be measured but the degradation rate dependence on temperature followed Arrhenius’ law, making it possible to extrapolate degradation rates at 25°C. According to these values, the DNA stored in the encapsulated blood products would remain larger than 20 kb after one century at ambient temperature. At last, qPCR experiments demonstrated the compatibility of extracted DNA with routine DNA downstream analyses. Altogether, these results showed that this novel storage method provides an adequate environment for ambient temperature long term storage of high molecular weight DNA in dehydrated lysates of white blood cells and buffy coats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5708797/,abstract

Accordingly, better knowledge on the pathophysiology of depression and mechanisms underlying depressive comorbidities in chronic medical conditions appears urgently needed, in order to help in the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. In this review, we present evidence pointing to inflammatory processes as key players in the pathophysiology and treatment of depressive symptoms. In particular, we report preclinical and clinical findings showing that inflammation-driven alterations in specific metabolic pathways, namely kynurenine and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathways, leads to substantial alterations in the metabolism of serotonin, glutamate and dopamine that are likely to contribute to the development of key depressive symptom dimensions. Accordingly, anti-inflammatory interventions targeting kynurenine and BH4 pathways may be effective as novel treatment or as adjuvants of conventional medications rather directed to monoamines, notably when depressive symptomatology and inflammation are comorbid in treated patients. This notion is discussed in the light of recent findings illustrating the tight interactions between known antidepressant drugs and inflammatory processes, as well as their therapeutic implications. Altogether, this review provides valuable findings for moving toward more adapted and personalized therapeutic strategies to treat inflammation-related depressive symptoms.Keywords: inflammation, neuroinflammation, kynurenines, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), monoamines, depressive symptoms, antidepressant treatment, anti-inflammatory strategies",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6095005/,abstract

Nevertheless, five different models of dietary regimes, which differ in their accuracy of Phe documentation, are used. To investigate the effect of the dietary regime on metabolic control, a multicenter evaluation was performed.Patients/Methods149 patients (max. 800 mg Phe-intake/day; 108 children aged 1–9 years and 41 adolescents aged 10–15 years) could be included. They were separated according to age and dietary regime, revealed by a questionnaire on dietary habits. Dietary regimes vary from daily strict calculation of all Phe-intake (group 1) to a rather loose regime only estimating Phe-intake and including high protein food (group 5). Data were analyzed with respect to metabolic control (Phe-concentrations, Phe-concentrations above upper recommended limit during 6 months before the interview), Phe-intake (mg/day) and age (years).ResultsMedian Phe-concentrations in children did not differ significantly among diet groups (group 1: 161; 2: 229, 3: 236, 4: 249, 5: 288 μmol/l, p = 0.175). However, exact daily Phe calculation led to significantly lower percentage of Phe concentrations above the upper recommended limit (group 1: 17, 2: 50, 3: 42, 4: 50, 5: 75%, p = 0.035). All included patients showed good to acceptable metabolic control. Patients on the dietary regime with the least accuracy, consuming also high protein foods, showed the poorest metabolic control. Median Phe concentrations of all other groups remained within recommended ranges, including from groups not calculating special low protein foods, fruit and vegetables and using a simplified system of recording Phe-intake.In adolescents no significant differences among diet groups were revealed.ConclusionExact calculation of Phe content of all food is not necessary to achieve good metabolic control in children and adolescents with PKU. Excluding special low protein food, as well as fruit and vegetables from calculation of Phe-intake has no impact on metabolic control. However including protein rich food into the diet and simply estimating all Phe-intake appears insufficient. The simplification of dietary regime may be helpful in enhancing acceptability and feasibility.Abbreviations: Phe, phenylalanine; PKU, phenylketonuria; Phe > limit, Phe-concentrations above the therapeutic limit; SD, standard deviationKeywords: Dietary regime, Phenylketonuria, Phenylalanine, Metabolic control, Phe-intake",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5471407/,abstract

Our group is evaluating the use of the homogentisic acid-lowering agent nitisinone in patients with AKU. A major biochemical consequence of this treatment is hypertyrosinaemia. Herein we report the concentration of 20 serum amino acids over a 36-month period pre- and post-treatment with nitisinone.Methods: Fasting serum samples were collected at baseline (pre-nitisinone), 3 (2 mg nitisinone every other day), 6, 12, 24 and 36 (2 mg nitisinone daily) months. Amino acids were measured using the Biochrom 30 high-performance liquid chromatography cation exchange system with ninhydrin detection.Results: Fifty patients [21 female, mean age (±standard deviation) 54.1 (15.6) years (range 25–75); 29 male, mean age 49.3 (11.6) years (range 22–70 years)] were included. Following treatment mean tyrosine concentrations increased seven- to eight-fold (baseline, 69.8 μmol/L; 3 months, 670.7 μmol/L; 6 months, 666.4 μmol/L; 12 months, 692.9 μmol/L; 24 months, 649.4 μmol/L; 36 months, 724.8 μmol/L, p = <0.001 for all visits compared to baseline).At baseline mean phenylalanine, aspartic acid and arginine were outside the normal reference range. Following treatment the ratios of phenylalanine/tyrosine, phenylalanine/large neutral amino acids, arginine/branched chain amino acids and branched chain/aromatic amino acids decreased (p = <0.05), and the tyrosine/large neutral amino acid ratio increased (p = <0.0001).Conclusions: Marked hypertyrosinaemia was observed following treatment with nitisinone. Noteworthy changes were also observed in the ratio of several amino acids following treatment with nitisinone suggesting that the availability of amino acids for neurotransmitter biosynthesis and liver function may be altered following treatment with nitisinone.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/8904_2018_109) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Alkaptonuria, Amino acids, Nitisinone",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6122054/,abstract

Surfactant replacement therapy may mitigate the symptoms of the disease by decreasing the surface tension of alveoli and facilitating inflation. However, surfactant serves an additional role in immunological processes. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that mechanisms of NRDS involving surfactant exert additional functions to promoting alveolar inflation. Using peripheral blood obtained from mature infants with and without NRDS, in tandem with mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) analysis, the present study identified that, while cell cycle regulation and alveolar surfactants serve a role in deterring the further onset of NRDS, innate and pathogen-induced responses of the immune system are among the most important factors in the pathology. The present study illustrated the regulatory importance of these immune pathways in response to alterations in the expression of gene families, particularly in perpetual lung injury leading to NRDS. Notably, data collected from the mRNA-seq analysis revealed similar mechanisms between NRDS and acute respiratory distress syndrome, a clinical phenotype precipitated by the manifestation of a severe form of lung injury due to numerous lung insults, implying that similar therapies may be applied to treat these two diseases.Keywords: mRNA sequencing, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanism",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5780146/,abstract

Generally, food intake measurement is based on self-reported dietary intake questionnaires, which have inherent limitations. They can be overcome by the use of biomarkers, capable of objectively assessing food consumption without the bias of self-reported dietary assessment. Another major goal is to determine the biological effects of foods and their impact on health. Systems analysis of dynamic responses may help to identify biomarkers indicative of intake and effects on the body at the same time, possibly in relation to individuals’ health/disease states. Such biomarkers could be used to quantify intake and validate intake questionnaires, analyse physiological or pathological responses to certain food components or diets, identify persons with specific dietary deficiency, provide information on inter-individual variations or help to formulate personalized dietary recommendations to achieve optimal health for particular phenotypes, currently referred as “precision nutrition.” In this regard, holistic approaches using global analysis methods (omics approaches), capable of gathering high amounts of data, appear to be very useful to identify new biomarkers and to enhance our understanding of the role of food in health and disease.Keywords: food intake assessment, integrative biomarkers, omics technologies, precision nutrition",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6567133/,abstract

A systematic literature review and a meta-analysis were undertaken to assess and compile published epidemiological data on MMA with a focus on the MMA mut subtype (OMIM #251000). Of the 1114 identified records, 227 papers were assessed for eligibility in full text, 48 articles reported on disease epidemiology, and 39 articles were included into the quantitative synthesis. Implementation of newborn screening in various countries has allowed for the estimation of birth prevalence of MMA and its isolated form. Meta-analysis pooled point estimates of MMA (all types) detection rates were 0.79, 1.12, 1.22 and 6.04 per 100,000 newborns in Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions, respectively. The detection rate of isolated MMA was < 1 per 100,000 newborns in all regions with the exception of MENA where it approached 6 per 100,000 newborns. Few studies published data on the epidemiology of MMA mut, therefore no meta-analysis could have been performed on this subtype.

A total of 322 study samples were collected from discarded residual dried blood spot samples following routine infant diagnosis of HIV. Equal proportions of HIV-positive and HIV-negative infant specimens were studied. Statistical differences in the prevalence of HBV between the HIV-positive and HIV-negative samples were calculated using the Pearson chi-square test, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Further testing for HBV DNA using a nested polymerase chain reaction method was performed.ResultsThe overall prevalence of HBV was 10%. In the HIV-positive group, 21 of 161 infants tested positive for HBV compared with 12 of 161 HIV-negative infants who tested positive for HBV.

Participants were selected with the aim of achieving a diverse sample with respect to treatment centre, IMD, and age of the child. Interviews emphasized the impacts of the disease and its treatment on the child and family and explicitly queried perceptions of interactions with the health care system. We identified emergent themes from the interview data.ResultsWe completed interviews with 21 parents/caregivers. The 21 children were aged <1 to 7 years old with IMD that included amino acid disorders, urea cycle disorders, fatty acid oxidation disorders, and organic acid disorders or ‘other’ IMD. Most parents reported that they and their families had adapted well to their child’s diagnosis. Parents used proactive coping strategies to integrate complex disease management protocols into routine family life. An important source of stress was concern about the social challenges faced by their children. Participants reported positive interactions with their most involved health care providers within the metabolic clinic. However, they reported challenges associated with the health care system outside of disease-specific metabolic care, when encountering systems and providers unfamiliar with the child’s disease.ConclusionsThe successful use of proactive coping strategies among parents of children with IMD in this study suggests the potential value of promoting positive coping and is an important direction for future study. Parents’ social concerns for their children were important stressors that warrant consideration by health care providers positioned to support families.

In the present study, we investigate the role of BH4 in the regulation of BAT. Hph-1 mice, a mouse model of BH4 deficiency, exhibit obesity, adiposity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and impaired BAT function. Impaired BAT function was ameliorated together with systemic metabolic disturbances by BAT transplantation from BH4-sufficient mice (control mice) into BH4-deficient mice, strongly suggesting that BH4-induced BAT has a critical role in the regulation of systemic energy metabolism. Both NA derived from the sympathetic nerve and NO derived from endothelial NOS in the blood vessels participate in the regulation of BH4. In addition, a direct effect of BH4 in the stimulation of brown adipocytes via NO is implicated.

While most repositioning efforts emerge through serendipity, we have devised a computational approach, which exploits interaction patterns shared between compounds. As a test case, we took the anti-viral drug brivudine (BVDU), which also has anti-cancer activity, and defined ten interaction patterns using our tool PLIP. These patterns characterise BVDU’s interaction with its target s. Using PLIP we performed an in silico screen of all structural data currently available and identified the FDA approved malaria drug amodiaquine as a promising repositioning candidate. We validated our prediction by showing that amodiaquine suppresses chemoresistance in a multiple myeloma cancer cell line by inhibiting the chaperone function of the cancer target Hsp27.

Mechanistically, CUDR enhances the phosphorylation of RB1, C-myc expression, and the interplay between the SET1A and pRB1. Notably, CUDR acts as a sponge cushion that shows a link between SET1A and pRB1, producing a activated pRB1–SET1A complex. On the other hand, the pRB1–SET1A complex may carry methyls(me) to occupy the position of H3K4, resulting in specific tri-methylation of forth lysine of histone H3 (H3K4me3). Thereby, the H3K4me3 loads on the TRF2 promoter region which causes the TRF2 overexpression. Ultimately, the excessive TRF2 binds to telomere repeat DNA, prolonging the telomere length.

In this paper, we review some of the main advances in the field over the past few years by discussing recent studies from literature. A biosensor, which is defined as an analytical device consisting of a biomolecule, a transducer and an output system, can be categorized according to the type of the incorporated biomolecule. The biomolecules can be enzymes, antibodies, ssDNA, organelles, cells etc. The main biosensor categories classified according to the biomolecules are enzymatic biosensors, immunosensors and DNA-based biosensors. These sensors can measure analytes produced or reduced during reactions at lower costs compared to the conventional detection techniques. Numerous types of biosensor studies conducted over the last decade have been explored here to reveal their key applications in medical, environmental and food industries which provide comprehensive perspective to the readers. Overviews of the working principles and applications of the reviewed sensors are also summarized.Keywords: biosensor, immunosensor, enzyme, DNA, medical analysis, environmental analysis, food analysis, nanotechnology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6021829/,abstract

To do so, we examined mean diffusivity (MD) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in two white matter brain regions (posterior parietal–occipital, PPO; centrum semiovale, CSO) and lifetime phenylalanine (Phe) exposure; the executive abilities examined included verbal strategic processing, nonverbal strategic processing, and working memory. Mediation modeling showed that MD in the PPO and CSO mediated the relationship between Phe exposure and nonverbal strategic processing, MD in the CSO mediated the relationship between Phe exposure and verbal strategic processing, and MD in the PPO mediated the relationship between Phe exposure and working memory.

A newborn screening program (NSP) for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) was carried out in Guangxi in order to understand the incidence of CH and the factors interrelated to major types of CH in this region of China. Methods. During 2009 to 2013, data from 930 612 newborns attending NSP in Guangxi were collected. Patients were classified with either permanent CH (PCH) or transient CH (TCH) after 2 years of progressive study. Results. A total of 1210 patients were confirmed with CH with an incidence of 1/769, including 68 PCH and 126 TCH cases with incidences of 1/6673 and 1/3385, respectively. The frequency of thyroid stimulating hormone values greater than 5 mIU/L was 7.2%, which, based on WHO guidelines, suggests that the population was mildly iodine deficient. Conclusions. The incidence of CH was high in Guangxi. Approximately two thirds of CH patients were TCH, which may be due to a deficiency in iodine within the population.Keywords: congenital hypothyroidism, permanent CH, transient CH, iodine deficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4784601/,abstract

About 30–40% of these patients become drug-resistant and land up with palliative or disease-modifying surgeries. This is a situation causing great concern in view of the psychosocial and economic burden on the patient and the family apart from severe cognitive and motor consequences, especially in children. Therefore, it is mandatory to have an insight into the wide spectrum of causes with reference to refractoriness to antiepileptic medications in children with epilepsy.Patients and Methods:Children admitted under our team with refractory epilepsy as per the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria in the last 3 years were included in the study.Results:Refractory epilepsy constituted 13.3% of inpatients in the pediatric group. Males dominated with 68.9% of these patients. Nearly 34.4% of these patients were found to suffer from various neurometabolic diseases. Almost 3.5% were due to pyridoxine-dependent convulsions. This group of patients showed an excellent response to dietary manipulation, disease-modifying treatment for the metabolic disorder, and supportive small-dose anticonvulsants. During follow-up, they showed very good response with reference to global development and seizure control.Conclusion:Pyridoxine-dependent convulsions are relatively rare forming about 3.5% of refractory epilepsies in this series. With initiation of appropriate therapy, results with reference to seizure control as well as neurodevelopment became evident within 2 weeks, and at 1-year follow-up, complete independence for majority of the needed activities is achieved with minimum cost, almost zero side effects, and absolute elimination of the need for palliative surgery.Key words: Neurometabolic disorders, pyridoxine-dependent seizures, refractory seizures",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108118/,abstract

These deficits in motivation and motor function are associated with alterations in corticostriatal neurocircuitry, which may reflect abnormalities in mesolimbic and mesostriatal dopamine (DA). One pathophysiologic pathway that may drive changes in DAergic corticostriatal circuitry is inflammation. Biomarkers of inflammation such as inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins are reliably elevated in a significant proportion of psychiatric patients. A variety of inflammatory stimuli have been found to preferentially target basal ganglia function to lead to impaired motivation and motor activity. Findings have included inflammation-associated reductions in ventral striatal neural responses to reward anticipation, decreased DA and DA metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid, and decreased availability, and release of striatal DA, all of which correlated with symptoms of reduced motivation and/or motor retardation. Importantly, inflammation-associated symptoms are often difficult to treat, and evidence suggests that inflammation may decrease DA synthesis and availability, thus circumventing the efficacy of standard pharmacotherapies. This review will highlight the impact of administration of inflammatory stimuli on the brain in relation to motivation and motor function. Recent data demonstrating similar relationships between increased inflammation and altered DAergic corticostriatal circuitry and behavior in patients with major depressive disorder will also be presented. Finally, we will discuss the mechanisms by which inflammation affects DA neurotransmission and relevance to novel therapeutic strategies to treat reduced motivation and motor symptoms in patients with high inflammation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5143486/,abstract

Decreasing cost of next‐generation sequencing (NGS) tests in recent years made it affordable. We witnessed the diagnostic yield and clinical use of different NGS strategies on a myriad of monogenic disorders in a pediatric setting.MethodsNext‐generation sequencing tests are performed for 98 unrelated Chinese patients within their first year of life, who were admitted to Xin Hua Hospital, affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, during a 2‐year period.ResultsClinical indications for NGS tests included a range of medical concerns. The mean age was 4.4 ± 4.2 months of age for infants undergoing targeting specific (known) disease‐causing genes (TRS) analysis, and 4.4 ± 4.3 months of age for whole‐exome sequencing (WES) (p > 0.05).

Eight core ARSs (EPRS, MRS, QRS, RRS, IRS, LRS, KRS, DRS) combined with three nonenzymatic components form a complex known as multisynthetase complex (MSC).We hypothesize that the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the eight core ARS coding genes might influence the susceptibility of sporadic congenital heart disease (CHD). Thus, we conducted a case-control study of 984 CHD cases and 2953 non-CHD controls in the Chinese Han population to evaluate the associations of 16 potentially functional SNPs within the eight ARS coding genes with the risk of CHD. We observed significant associations with the risk of CHD for rs1061248 [G/A; odds ratio (OR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.81–0.99; P = 3.81×10−2], rs2230301 [A/C; OR = 0.73, 95%CI = 0.60–0.90, P = 3.81×10−2], rs1061160 [G/A; OR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.06–1.31; P = 3.53×10−3] and rs5030754 [G/A; OR = 1.39, 95%CI = 1.11–1.75; P = 4.47×10−3] of EPRS gene.

Early in the process, the DGAC developed a conceptual model and formulated questions to examine nutritional risk and determinants and impact of dietary patterns in relation to numerous health outcomes among individuals aged ≥2 y. As detailed in the report, an expansive, transparent, and comprehensive process was used to address each question, with multiple opportunities for public input included. Consensus was reached on all DGAC’s findings, including each conclusion and recommendation, and the entire report. When research questions were answered by original systematic literature reviews and/or with existing, high-quality expert reports, the quality and strength of the evidence was formally graded. The report was organized around the following 5 themes: 1) food and nutrient intakes and health: current status and trends; 2) dietary patterns, foods and nutrients, and health outcomes; 3) diet and physical activity behavior change; 4) food and physical activity environments; and 5) food sustainability and food safety. The following 3 cross-cutting topics were addressed: 1) sodium, 2) saturated fat, and 3) added sugars. Physical activity recommendations from recent expert reports were endorsed. The overall quality of the American diet was assessed to identify overconsumed and underconsumed nutrients of public health concern. Common food characteristics of healthy dietary patterns were determined. Features of effective interventions to change individual and population diet and physical activity behaviors in clinical, public health, and community settings were identified.

Personalized nutrition in athletic populations aims to optimize health, body composition, and exercise performance by targeting dietary recommendations to an individual's genetic profile. Sport dietitians and nutritionists have long been adept at placing additional scrutiny on the one-size-fits-all general population dietary guidelines to accommodate various sporting populations. However, generic “one-size-fits-all” recommendations still remain. Genetic differences are known to impact absorption, metabolism, uptake, utilization and excretion of nutrients and food bioactives, which ultimately affects a number of metabolic pathways. Nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics are experimental approaches that use genomic information and genetic testing technologies to examine the role of individual genetic differences in modifying an athlete's response to nutrients and other food components. Although there have been few randomized, controlled trials examining the effects of genetic variation on performance in response to an ergogenic aid, there is a growing foundation of research linking gene-diet interactions on biomarkers of nutritional status, which impact exercise and sport performance. This foundation forms the basis from which the field of sport nutrigenomics continues to develop.

Here, we tested the effects of reducing DA on reward- and punishment-based learning using the deterministic passive avoidance learning (PAL) task We tested 16 (5 female) adults (ages 22–40) in a randomized, cross-over design to determine whether reducing global DA by administering an amino acid beverage deficient in the DA precursors, phenylalanine and tyrosine (P/T[−]), would affect performance on the PAL task. We found that P/T[−] beverage effects on PAL performance were modulated by age. In particular, we found that P/T depletion significantly improved learning from punishment with increasing participant age. Participants committed 1.49 fewer passive avoidance errors per additional year of age (95% CI, −0.71 – −2.27, r=−0.74, p=0.001). Moreover, in this small sample, P/T depletion improved learning from punishment in adults (ages 26–40) while it impaired learning from punishment in emerging adults (ages 22–25). We observed similar, but non-significant trends in learning from reward. While there was no overall effect of P/T-depletion on reaction time (RT), there was a relationship between the effect of P/T depletion on PAL performance and RT; those who responded more slowly on the P/T[−] beverage also made more errors on the P/T[−] beverage. When P/T-depletion slowed RT after a correct response, there was a worsening of PAL task performance; there was no similar relationship for the RT after an incorrect response and PAL task performance. Moreover, among emerging adults, changes in mood on the P/T[−] beverage negatively correlated with learning from reward on the P/T[−] beverage.

Proliferative and apoptotic responses for each of the experimental groups were determined by MTS and flow cytometry. The results revealed that MK-801 and NMDA exerted significant effects on hippocampal NSCs proliferation. Cell survival rates decreased in MK-801, NMDA and M+N treated groups compared with the control group. Cells survival rates in NMDA and M+N treated groups increased compared with the MK-801 treated group. MK-801 and NMDA were demonstrated to significantly affect apoptosis in hippocampal NSCs. Total and early stages of apoptosis in MK-801 and NMDA groups significantly increased compared with the control group. Total and early apoptosis of NSCs in the M+N group significantly decreased compared with MK-801 and NMDA groups.

Background: There are few centres which specialise in the care of adults with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). To anticipate facilities and staffing needed at these centres, it is of interest to know the distribution of the different disorders.
Methods: A survey was distributed through the list-serve of the SSIEM Adult Metabolic Physicians group asking clinicians for number of patients with confirmed diagnoses, types of diagnoses and age at diagnosis.
Results: Twenty-four adult centres responded to our survey with information on 6,692 patients. Of those 6,692 patients, 510 were excluded for diagnoses not within the IEM spectrum (e.g. bone dysplasias, hemochromatosis) or for age less than 16 years, leaving 6,182 patients for final analysis. The most common diseases followed by the adult centres were phenylketonuria (20.6%), mitochondrial disorders (14%) and lysosomal storage disorders (Fabry disease (8.8%), Gaucher disease (4.2%)). Amongst the disorders that can present with acute metabolic decompensation, the urea cycle disorders, specifically ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, were most common (2.2%), followed by glycogen storage disease type I (1.5%) and maple syrup urine disease (1.1%). Patients were frequently diagnosed as adults, particularly those with mitochondrial disease and lysosomal storage disorders.
Conclusions: A wide spectrum of IEM are followed at adult centres. Specific knowledge of these disorders is needed to provide optimal care including up-to-date knowledge of treatments and ability to manage acute decompensation.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this chapter (doi:10.1007/8904_2015_435) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5580735/,abstract

We utilized hepatitis B virus (HBV) enhancer I and preS1 promoter sequences, which exhibit cell type specificity, to analyze transcriptional control in pluripotential murine embryonic stem (ES) cells, bipotential HBC-3 progenitor liver cells, mature hepatocytes, and fibroblasts. In transient transfection assays, HBV sequences were most active in primary hepatocytes, followed by HBC-3 and ES cells, and became inactive in fibroblasts. Cotransfections with HNF-3 or C/EBP plasmids increased expression of HBV sequences in hepatocytes and HBC-3 cells. However, increased HBV expression was not observed in ES cells and HBV remained inactive in fibroblasts, suggesting different transcriptional controls, which was compatible with alterations in the abundance of endogenous transcription factors. Analysis in somatic hybrid cells created from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and Hepa1-6 mouse hepatocytes with expression of albumin and selected hepatic transcription factors showed that HBV sequences were expressed weakly but without increased expression following transfection of HNF-1, HNF-3, and C/EBP plasmids. These findings indicated that repression of HBV in nonpermissive cells involved inactivation of transcription factor activity. Expression of HBV in stem cells is relevant for mechanisms concerning viral persistence and oncogenesis, as well as analysis of hepatocytic differentiation in progenitor cells.Keywords: Hepatitis B virus, Transcription factor, Gene expression, Stem cell, Liver",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6157367/,abstract

Adherence to this diet is burdensome due to the need for specially prepared low-Phe meals and regular monitoring of Phe concentrations. A UK cross-sectional study was conducted to identify the personal time and monetary burden associated with aspects of the PKU lifestyle for caregivers of children (aged < 18 years) living with PKU.MethodsCaregivers of pediatric patients with PKU attending one of four specialist metabolic centers in the UK were invited to participate in a questionnaire-based survey that evaluated different aspects of PKU management that could potentially present out-of-pocket costs (OOPCs) or time burden. Medical clinicians/dieticians provided patient information on PKU severity and an assessment of blood Phe control.ResultsThe survey was completed by 114 caregivers of 106 children having mild or moderate (n = 45; 39%) or classical (n = 60; 53%) PKU (severity data missing for n = 1), among whom 8 (8%) and 87 (82%) reported poorly controlled and controlled blood Phe status, respectively; Phe control data were missing for 11 children. Dietary management of PKU incurred a median time burden of > 19 h per week. OOPCs were incurred via attendance at PKU events, PKU-related equipment, and extra holiday expenditure. 21% of caregivers reduced their working hours (median 18.5 h/week) to care for their child, with a further 24% leaving their paid jobs completely.Discussion and conclusionsDietary management of PKU is associated with a considerable time burden for caregivers of pediatric patients with PKU. A personal financial burden also arises from OOPCs and lost earnings.Abbreviations: ACBS, Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances; DLA, Disability Living Allowance; NHS, National Health Service; NRES, NHS Research Ethics Committees; OOPC, out-of-pocket cost; PAH, phenylalanine hydroxylase; Phe, phenylalanine; PKU, phenylketonuriaKeywords: Burden, Caregiver, Diet, Phenylalanine, Phenylketonuria, Pediatric",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5009233/,abstract

Molecular detection of infectious pathogens in dried blood spots (DBS) is an ideal method for surveillance of infections in resource-limited settings because of its low cost, minimal blood volumes involved, and ease of storage at ambient temperature. Our study aim was to evaluate a Streptococcus pneumoniae real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) assay on DBS from febrile Nigerian children on Whatman 903 and FTA filter papers, compared to the gold standard of culture.MethodsBetween September 2011 to May 2015, blood was collected from children 5 years of age or under who presented to six hospital study sites throughout northern and central Nigeria with febrile illness, and inoculated into blood culture bottles or spotted onto Whatman 903 or FTA filter paper. Culture and rt-PCR were performed on all samples.ResultsA total of 537 DBS specimens from 535 children were included in the study, of which 15 were culture-positive for S. pneumoniae. The rt-PCR assay detected S. pneumoniae in 12 DBS specimens (2.2%). One positive rt-PCR result was identified in a culture-negative specimen from a high-risk subject, and two positive rt-PCR results were negative on repeat testing. Six culture-confirmed cases of S. pneumoniae bacteremia were missed. Compared to culture, the overall sensitivities of Whatman 903 and FTA DBS for detection of S. pneumoniae were 57.1% (95% CI 18.4–90.1%) and 62.5% (95% CI 24.5–91.5%), respectively. Nonspecific amplification was noted in an additional 22 DBS (4.1%). Among these, six were positive for a non-S. pneumoniae pathogen on culture.ConclusionsRt-PCR was able to detect S. pneumoniae from clinical DBS specimens, including from a culture-negative specimen. Our findings show promise of this approach as a surveillance diagnostic, but also raise important cautionary questions. Several DBS specimens were detected as S. pneumoniae by rt-PCR despite growth of a non-S. pneumoniae pathogen on culture.

Neonatal seizures represent the clinical manifestation of a non-specific disorder of cortical cerebral dysfunction, which could lead to permanent brain injury.

Thus, many organisms have evolved degradation strategies that prevent endogenous accumulation of amino acids. L-2,3-diaminopropionate (Dap) is a non-protein amino acid produced in nature where it serves as a precursor to siderophores, neurotoxins, and antibiotics. Dap accumulation in S. enterica was previously shown to inhibit growth by unknown mechanisms. The production of diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase (DpaL) alleviated Dap toxicity in S. enterica by catalyzing the degradation of Dap to pyruvate and ammonia. Here, we demonstrate that Dap accumulation in S. enterica elicits a proline requirement for growth and specifically inhibits coenzyme A and isoleucine biosynthesis. Additionally, we establish that the DpaL-dependent degradation of Dap to pyruvate proceeds through an unbound 2-aminoacrylate (2AA) intermediate, thus contributing to 2AA stress inside the cell. The reactive intermediate deaminase, RidA, is shown to prevent 2AA damage caused by DpaL-dependent Dap degradation by enhancing the rate of 2AA hydrolysis. The results presented herein inform our understanding of the effects Dap has on metabolism in S. enterica, and likely other organisms, and highlight the critical role played by RidA in preventing 2AA stress stemming from Dap detoxification.Keywords: 2-aminoacrylate, RidA, enamine stress, metabolic stress",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5384650/,abstract

The aims of this study were to explore longitudinal change in cognitive function in youth with T1DM as compared to non-diabetic sibling controls, and how glycemic control and age of onset influence cognitive performance over time.MethodsWe assessed crystallized intelligence, visual-spatial ability, delayed memory, and processing speed at three time points using the same cognitive tasks in youth with T1DM and sibling controls. Hierarchical linear modeling examined relationships between diabetes, hyperglycemia (HbA1c values), age of onset, and cognition over 5.5 years.ResultsYouth with diabetes performed worse than controls on visual-spatial ability and memory tasks over time, and did not improve as much in processing speed. Greater hyperglycemia was associated with lower crystallized intelligence and slower processing speed but better memory across all time points. There was a stronger negative relationship between hyperglycemia and visual-spatial ability for youth with earlier compared to later onset diabetes. Importantly, within-person decreases in hyperglycemia between time points were associated with improved visual-spatial ability and faster processing speed.ConclusionsOn average, differences in cognitive function between youth with T1DM and non-diabetic relatives are maintained or increase during childhood and adolescence. Hyperglycemia and age of onset can have negative effects on the developmental trajectories of cognitive processes in youth with T1DM. However, treatments that lower hyperglycemia may lead to improved cognitive function in youth with T1DM.Keywords: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1, Pediatrics, Hyperglycemia, Cognition, Memory",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5912686/,abstract

In this way, evolution inextricably linked diet to all major physiological systems including the nervous system. The importance of diet in neurological development is well documented, although the mechanisms by which diet-derived signaling molecules (DSMs) affect cognition are poorly understood. Studies on the positive impact of nutritive and non-nutritive bioactive molecules on brain function are encouraging but lack the statistical power needed to demonstrate strong positive associations. Establishing associations between DSMs and cognitive functions like mood, memory and learning are made even more difficult by the lack of robust phenotypic markers that can be used to accurately and reproducibly measure the effects of DSMs. Lastly, it is now apparent that processes like neurogenesis and neuroplasticity are embedded within layers of interlocked signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks. Within these interdependent pathways and networks, the various transducers of DSMs are used combinatorially to produce those emergent adaptive gene expression responses needed for stimulus-induced neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Taken together, it appears that cognition is encoded genomically and modified by epigenetics and epitranscriptomics to produce complex transcriptional programs that are exquisitely sensitive to signaling molecules from the environment.

In this direction, it was reported that surface hydration is important for the binding affinity of the amino acid which significantly perturbs 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) monolayer structure and morphology. A deeper insight showed that Phe inserts in DPPC monolayer defects as a monomer at pH 5 and forms aggregates that adsorb to the membrane surface generating a reconfiguration of the lipid arrangement in areas of higher packing. This new arrangement in the monolayer causes the reorientation of dipoles of lipid and water molecules which is congruent with the dehydration and surface tension changes reported above. With this background, this article studies the affinity of Phe in liquid-expanded 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphocholine (LE DMPC) and liquid-condensed 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (LC DPPC) monolayers and their effects on membrane properties.Results:The adsorption of Phe can be described by a cooperative process in non-independent sites suggesting that Phe/lipid systems reorganize to form new structures at a high degree of coverage. Compressibility modulus and Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) images allow to propose that Phe causes a new phase in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphocholine (DMPC) and DPPC.Conclusions:Phe imposes new arrangements in the lipid phase to form new structures with different compressibility behavior than lipid binary mixtures of DMPC and DPPC. Phe interaction with the LC and LE phases gives place to a process in which a synergistic effect between non-independent sites can be produced. These features of Phe/lipid interaction would be of great importance to understand the multiple effects of Phe on cell membranes.Keywords: DMPC, DPPC, monolayers, phenylalanine, compressibility, domains",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6322106/,abstract

At the cellular and molecular level, these conserved genes likely function in a very similar mode, but are doing so in different tissues or cell types and can result in different phenotypic effects.

On the hypothesis that poor palatability, volume and frequency of drug/formula administration contribute to treatment non-adherence and hyperammonemic episodes, a survey was conducted of patient, caregiver (CG) and physician perspectives on treatments used in urea cycle disorders (UCD).MethodsA paper and online survey assessed experience with UCD medications, medical foods and dietary supplements.Results25 physicians, 52 adult patients and 114 CG responded. In 2009, the most common UCD-specific intervention reported by patients included sodium phenylbutyrate (60%), followed by l-citrulline (46%), amino acid medical foods (15%), l-arginine preparations (18%), and sodium benzoate (8%). Only 36% of patients reported experiencing no hyperammonemic episodes in the last 2 years. The most commonly reported cause of hyperammonemic episodes was infection or other acute illnesses, followed by dietary indiscretion, side effects of medications, and drug non-adherence. Most patients, caregivers and physicians (> 75%) ranked nitrogen-scavenging medications, l-citrulline, l-arginine, and medical foods as “effective” or “very effective.” Non-adherence was common (e.g. 18% of patients admitted to missing sodium phenylbutyrate “at least once a week” and “at least one a day”). Barriers to adherence included taste of medications, frequency of drug administration, number of pills, difficulty swallowing pills, side effects, forgetting to take medications, and high cost. Strategies to mitigate the gastrointestinal side effects of medications included the use of gastric tubes and acid reflux medications. Physicians indicated that 25% and 33% of pediatric and adult patients, respectively, were given less than the recommended dose of sodium phenylbutyrate due to concerns of tolerance, administration, and cost.ConclusionsDespite positive views of their effectiveness, respondents found medications, medical foods and dietary supplements difficult to take and viewed adherence as inadequate, thus contributing to hyperammonemic episodes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4963256/,abstract

The optimal amount and ratio of additional amino acids is undefined.AimA longitudinal, parallel, controlled study over 12 months evaluating a CGMP (CGMP-AA2) formulation compared with phenylalanine-free L-amino acid supplements (L-AA) on blood Phe, Tyr, Phe:Tyr ratio, biochemical nutritional status and growth in children with PKU. The CGMP-AA2 contained 36 mg Phe per 20 g protein equivalent.MethodsChildren with PKU, with a median age of 9.2 y (5-16y) were divided into 2 groups: 29 were given CGMP-AA2, 19 remained on Phe-free L-AA. The CGMP-AA2 formula gradually replaced L-AA, providing blood Phe concentrations were maintained within target range. Median blood Phe, Tyr, Phe:Tyr ratio and anthropometry, were compared within and between the two groups at baseline, 26 and 52 weeks. Nutritional biochemistry was studied at baseline and 26 weeks only.ResultsAt the end of 52 weeks only 48% of subjects were able to completely use CGMP-AA2 as their single source of protein substitute. At 52 weeks CGMP-AA2 provided a median of 75% (30–100) of the total protein substitute with the remainder being given as L-AA. Within the CGMP-AA2 group, blood Phe increased significantly between baseline and 52 weeks: [baseline to 26 weeks; baseline Phe 270 μmol/L (170–430); 26 weeks, Phe 300 μmol/L (125–485) p = 0.06; baseline to 52 weeks: baseline, Phe 270 μmol/L (170–430), 52 weeks Phe 300 μmol/L (200–490), p < 0.001)]. However, there were no differences between the CGMP-AA2 and L-AA group for Phe, Tyr, Phe:Tyr ratio or anthropometry at any of the three measured time points. Within the CGMP-AA2 group only weight (p = 0.0001) and BMI z scores (p = 0.0001) increased significantly between baseline to 52 weeks. Whole blood and plasma selenium were significantly higher (whole blood selenium [p = 0.0002]; plasma selenium [p = 0.0007]) at 26 weeks in the CGMP-AA2 group compared L-AA. No differences were observed within the L-AA group for any of the nutritional markers.ConclusionsCGMP-AA increases blood Phe concentrations and so it can only be used partly to contribute to protein substitute in some children with PKU. CGMP-AA should be carefully introduced in children with PKU and close monitoring of blood Phe control is essential.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s13023-019-1011-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Glycomacropeptide, Phenylalanine, Large neutral amino acids, Protein substitute, Phenylketonuria",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6377744/,abstract

Paradoxically, many genetic variants that have been associated with increased risks of such diseases are found in genomes of long-lived people, and do not seem to compromise longevity. Here we argue that trade-off-like and conditional effects of genes can play central role in this phenomenon and in determining longevity. Such effects may occur as result of: (i) antagonistic influence of gene on the development of different health disorders; (ii) change in the effect of gene on vulnerability to death with age (especially, from “bad” to “good”); (iii) gene–gene interaction; and (iv) gene–environment interaction, among other factors. A review of current knowledge provides many examples of genetic factors that may increase the risk of one disease but reduce chances of developing another serious health condition, or improve survival from it. Factors that may increase risk of a major disease but attenuate manifestation of physical senescence are also discussed. Overall, available evidence suggests that the influence of a genetic variant on longevity may be negative, neutral or positive, depending on a delicate balance of the detrimental and beneficial effects of such variant on multiple health and aging related traits. This balance may change with age, internal and external environments, and depend on genetic surrounding. We conclude that trade-off-like and conditional genetic effects are very common and may result in situations when a disease “risk allele” can also be a pro-longevity variant, depending on context. We emphasize importance of considering such effects in both aging research and disease prevention.Keywords: Genetic risk factors, Trade-offs, Longevity, Aging, Physical senescence, Age-specific influence, Conditional effects, Epistasis, Gene–environment interaction, Complex disease",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4724477/,abstract

Recently, the development of new technologies and treatments has led to calls for the addition of new conditions to the screening programs. Internationally, it is recognized by governments that national policies for newborn screening should support transparent and evidence-based decision making, and promote consistency between states within a country. Australia is lagging behind the international community, and currently has no national policies or decision-making processes, agreed by government, to support its newborn screening programs. In contrast, New Zealand (NZ), the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States of America (US) have robust and transparent processes to assess conditions for screening, which have been developed by, and have pathways to, government. This review provides detail on the current policy environment for newborn screening in Australia, highlighting that there are a number of risks to the programs resulting from the lack of a decision-making process.

Most of the variants currently known to be associated with T2D risk have been identified in large studies that included tens of thousands of individuals who are representative of a single major ethnic group such as European, Asian, or African. However, most of these variants have only modest effects on the risk for T2D; identification of definitive 'causal variant' or 'causative loci' is typically lacking. Studies in isolated populations offer several advantages over outbred populations despite being, on average, much smaller in sample size. For example, reduced genetic variability, enrichment of rare variants, and a more uniform environment and lifestyle, which are hallmarks of isolated populations, can reduce the complexity of identifying disease-associated genes. To date, studies in isolated populations have provided valuable insight into the genetic basis of T2D by providing both a deeper understanding of previously identified T2D-associated variants (e.g. demonstrating that variants in KCNQ1 have a strong parent-of-origin effect) or providing novel variants (e.g. ABCC8 in Pima Indians, TBC1D4 in the Greenlandic population, HNF1A in Canadian Oji-Cree). This review summarizes advancements in genetic studies of T2D in outbred and isolated populations, and provides information on whether the difference in the prevalence of T2D in different populations (Pima Indians vs. non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Whites vs. non-Hispanic Blacks) can be explained by the difference in risk allele frequencies of established T2D variants.Keywords: type 2 diabetes, GWAS, imputation, SNP, meta-analysis, ethnic group, functional variant, risk",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5275756/,abstract

These transcriptional modules contained evolutionary-conserved clusters of putative transcription factor binding sites that correspond to a “molecular signature” associated with robust gene expression in the heart. We then validated these CS-CRMs in vivo using an adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 that drives a reporter gene from a quintessential cardiac-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter. Most de novo designed CS-CRMs resulted in a >10-fold increase in cardiac gene expression. The most robust CRMs enhanced cardiac-specific transcription 70- to 100-fold.

Sprague‐Dawley rats (n = 15, 399 ± 57 g) were anesthetized and instrumented with an indwelling brachial artery catheter, femoral artery flow probe, and a stimulating electrode on the lumbar sympathetic chain.

Although a build-up of phenylalanine causes irreversible cognitive impairment, this can be prevented through a strict, lifelong diet restricted in natural protein. Despite the severe consequences of poor metabolic control, many children and adolescents have phenylalanine levels above their recommended limits. This systematic review was the first to examine studies reporting demographic and/or psychosocial influences on blood phenylalanine levels, with the aim to identify factors that were robustly linked with metabolic control. Four electronic databases were searched, yielding 1,808 articles. Articles were included if they reported a statistical examination of the association between one or more demographic or psychosocial factor(s) and metabolic control (as measured by blood phenylalanine concentration) for children and adolescents with PKU. Twenty-nine studies were selected for inclusion, which examined a range of child, parent and family factors related to blood phenylalanine levels. The most reproducible association was with child age, with metabolic control worsening with increasing age. This suggests that interventions promoting treatment adherence would be particularly beneficial for adolescents. There was a paucity of studies in some areas, and the quality of included studies varied; therefore, the conclusions of this review are preliminary.

PAH senses elevated Phe concentrations by transient allosteric Phe binding to a protein–protein interface between ACT domains of different subunits in a PAH tetramer. This interface is present in an activated PAH (A-PAH) tetramer and absent in a resting-state PAH (RS-PAH) tetramer. To investigate this allosteric sensing mechanism, here we used the GROMACS molecular dynamics simulation suite on the Folding@home computing platform to perform extensive molecular simulations and Markov state model (MSM) analysis of Phe binding to ACT domain dimers. These simulations strongly implicated a conformational selection mechanism for Phe association with ACT domain dimers and revealed protein motions that act as a gating mechanism for Phe binding. The MSMs also illuminate a highly mobile hairpin loop, consistent with experimental findings also presented here that the PAH variant L72W does not shift the PAH structural equilibrium toward the activated state. Finally, simulations of ACT domain monomers are presented, in which spontaneous transitions between resting-state and activated conformations are observed, also consistent with a mechanism of conformational selection. These mechanistic details provide detailed insight into the regulation of PAH activation and provide testable hypotheses for the development of new allosteric effectors to correct structural and functional defects in PAH.Keywords: molecular dynamics, ligand-binding protein, kinetics, allosteric regulation, conformational change, binding pathways, ligand binding kinetics, Markov state models, phenylketonuria, phenylalanine hydroxylase, molecular simulation, conformational selection",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6314134/,abstract

Moreover, there is a great paucity of imaging studies of adult ADHD to date that have excluded patients with history of use of stimulant medication.MethodsA newly validated method named optimally-discriminative voxel-based analysis (ODVBA) was applied to multimodal (structural and DTI) MRI data acquired from 22 treatment-naïve ADHD adults and 19 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC).ResultsRegarding DTI data, we found higher fractional anisotropy in ADHD relative to HC encompassing the white matter (WM) of the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal left gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, bilateral cingulate gyrus, bilateral middle temporal gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus; reductions in trace (a measure of diffusivity) in ADHD relative to HC were also found in fronto-striatal-parieto-occipital circuits, including the right superior frontal gyrus and bilateral middle frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus and bilateral cingulate gyrus, as well as the left body and right splenium of the corpus callosum, right superior corona radiata, and right superior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi. Volumetric abnormalities in ADHD subjects were found only at a trend level of significance, including reduced gray matter (GM) in the right angular gyrus, and increased GM in the right supplementary motor area and superior frontal gyrus.ConclusionsOur results suggest that adult ADHD is associated with neuroanatomical abnormalities mainly affecting the WM microstructure in fronto-parieto-temporal circuits that have been implicated in cognitive, emotional and visuomotor processes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4195718/,abstract

Background: SUPPORT tools consist of 18 articles addressing the health policy-makers so that they can learn how to make evidence-informed health policies. These tools have been particularly recommended for developing countries. The present study tries to explain the process of evidence utilization for developing policy documents in the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoHME) and to compare the findings with those of SUPPORT tools.

Methods: A qualitative research was conducted, using the framework analysis approach. Participants consisted of senior managers and technicians in MoHME. Purposeful sampling was done, with a maximum variety, for the selection of research participants: individuals having at least 5 years of experience in preparing evidence-based policy documents. Face-to-face interviews were conducted for data collection. As a guideline for the interviews, ‘the Utilization of Evidence in Policy-Making Organizations’ procedure was used. The data were analyzed through the analysis of the framework method using MAXQDA 10 software.

Results: The participants acquired the research evidence in a topic-based form, and they were less likely to search on the basis of the evidence pyramid. To assess the quality of evidence, they did not use standard critical tools; to adapt the evidence and interventions with the local setting, they did not use the ideas and experiences of all stakeholders, and in preparing the evidence-based policy documents, they did not take into consideration the window of opportunity, did not refrain from using highly technical terms, did not write user-friendly summaries, and did not present alternative policy options. In order to develop health policies, however, they used the following innovations: attention to the financial burden of policy issues on the agenda, sensitivity analysis of the preferred policy option on the basis of technical, sociopolitical, and economic feasibility, advocacy from other scholars, using the multi-criteria decision-making models for the prioritization of policy options, implementation of policy based on the degree of readiness of policy-implementing units, and the classification of policy documents on the basis of different conditions of policy-making (urgent, short-term, and long-term).

Conclusion: Findings showed that the process of evidence utilization in IR-MoH enjoys some innovations for the support of health policy development. The present study provides IR-MoH with considerable opportunities for the improvement of evidence-informed health policy-making. Moreover, the SUPPORT process and tools are recommended to be used in developing countries.

First, we described the characteristics of gene variants in Jiangsu Province. We collected clinical data from three NBS centers. All infants followed a unified screening and diagnosis process. After obtaining informed consent, dried blood spots (DBSs) were collected and analyzed by TMS. If the results fell outside of the cut-off value, repeat analysis was performed. If the re-test results remained abnormal, the infant was recalled for further assessment. We performed targeted sequencing using the extended edition panel of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) to detect 306 genes using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. A total of 536,008 babies underwent NBS by TMS in three NBS centres. In total, 194 cases were eventually diagnosed with various types of inherited metabolic diseases, with an overall incidence of 1/2763. There were 23 types of diseases, including ten amino acid disorders (43.5%), eight organic acidaemias (34.8%) and five fatty acid oxidation defects (21.7%). In these infants, we clearly identified variants of disease-causing genes by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Most had two variants and others had one or three variants: 88% of gene variants were heterozygous and 12% were homozygous. There is a certain incidence of IEM in Jiangsu Province and it is necessary to carry out screening for 27 diseases. Meanwhile, NGS combined with TMS offers an enhanced plan for NBS for IEM.Keywords: newborn screening, inborn errors of metabolism, tandem mass spectrometry, next-generation sequencing, gene diagnosis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6382741/,abstract

Besides dietary phenylalanine restriction, new therapeutic options are emerging, such as the treatment with BH4 in subgroups of PKU patients responding to a loading test with BH4.MethodsA no-profit open-label interventional trial with long-term oral BH4 therapy, sponsored by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA), was performed in a group of 17 PKU patients resulted as BH4 responders among 46 subjects analyzed for BH4-responsiveness (prot. FARM5MATC7). We report on efficacy and safety data of BH4 therapy and analyze factors predicting BH4-responsiveness and long-term response to BH4. A BH4-withdrawal test was used as a proof of the efficacy of long-term therapy with BH4.ResultsForty-four percent of the patients responded to the 48 h-long loading test with BH4. All the phenotypic classes were represented. Genotype was the best predictor of responsiveness, along with lower phenylalanine levels at diagnosis, higher tolerance and lower phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio before the test. In BH4 responder patients, long-term BH4 therapy resulted safe and effective in increasing tolerance while maintaining a good metabolic control. The BH4 withdrawal test, performed in a subset of patients, showed that improved tolerance was directly dependent on BH4 assumption. Tolerance to phenylalanine was re-evaluated in 43.5% of patients and was longitudinally analyzed in 5 patients.ConclusionsLong-term treatment with BH4 is safe and effective in increasing tolerance to phenylalanine. There is real need to assess the actual tolerance to phenylalanine in PKU patients to ameliorate quality of life, improve nutritional status, avoiding unnecessarily restricted diets, and interpret the effects of new therapies for PKU.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13023-015-0227-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, Phenylketonuria, Tetrahydrobiopterin, Sapropterin, Hyperphenylalaninemia, Therapy, Tolerance, Safety, Side effects",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351928/,abstract

Of the 2338 identified records, 188 articles were assessed for eligibility in full text, 43 articles reported on disease epidemiology, and 31 studies were included into the quantitative synthesis. Due to the rarity of PA, broadly targeted population-based prevalence studies are not available. Nonetheless, implementation of newborn screening programs has allowed the estimation of the birth prevalence data of PA across multiple geographic regions. The pooled point estimates indicated detection rates of 0.29; 0.33; 0.33 and 4.24 in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions, respectively.

The results showed significant improvements both in well-being and in internalizing symptoms in response to the intervention activities. We used multivariate twin analyses of repeated measures, tracking stability and change in genetic and environmental influences, to assess the impact of this environmental intervention on these variance components. The heritability of well-being remained high both before and after the intervention, and the same genetic effects were important at each stage, even as well-being increased. The overall magnitude of environmental influences was also stable across the intervention; however, different non-shared environmental influences emerged during the intervention.

If necessary to rapidly lower plasma concentrations of teriflunomide, an accelerated elimination procedure using cholestyramine or activated charcoal may be used. The current bioanalytical assay for determination of plasma teriflunomide concentration requires laboratory facilities for blood centrifugation and plasma storage. An alternative method, with potential for greater convenience, is dried blood spot (DBS) methodology. Analytical and clinical validations are required to switch from plasma to DBS (finger-prick sampling) methodology.Methods:Using blood samples from healthy subjects, an LC-MS/MS assay method for quantification of teriflunomide in DBS over a range of 0.01–10 mcg/mL was developed and validated for specificity, selectivity, accuracy, precision, reproducibility, and stability. Results were compared with those from the current plasma assay for determination of plasma teriflunomide concentration.Results:Method was specific and selective relative to endogenous compounds, with process efficiency ∼88%, and no matrix effect. Inaccuracy and imprecision for intraday and interday analyses were <15% at all concentrations tested. Quantification of teriflunomide in DBS assay was not affected by blood deposit volume and punch position within spot, and hematocrit level had a limited but acceptable effect on measurement accuracy. Teriflunomide was stable for at least 4 months at room temperature, and for at least 24 hours at 37°C with and without 95% relative humidity, to cover sampling, drying, and shipment conditions in the field. The correlation between DBS and plasma concentrations (R2 = 0.97), with an average blood to plasma ratio of 0.59, was concentration independent and constant over time.Conclusions:DBS sampling is a simple and practical method for monitoring teriflunomide concentrations.Key Words: teriflunomide, dried blood spot, LC-MS/MS",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4949010/,abstract

The Cochrane Review Manager was used to analyze the relevant data.RESULTSNineteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria and showed that compared with the control group, LGG administration notably reduced the diarrhea duration [mean difference (MD) -24.02 h, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-36.58, -11.45)]. More effective results were detected at a high dose ≥ 1010 CFU per day [MD -22.56 h, 95%CI (-36.41, -8.72)] vs a lower dose.

As a result, we aimed at addressing the effects, if any, of pyriproxyfen on neurodevelopment in the zebrafish embryo as a vertebrate model. Using zebrafish transgenic lines expressing GFP in different cell populations (elavl3 in newborn neurons, gfap and nestin in neural stem cells), we focused on the analysis of whole embryonic brain volume after confocal 3D-reconstruction and the quantification of purified neural stem cells during early neurodevelopment by FACS-cell sorting from whole in vivo embryos. Interestingly, though lethal at very high doses, pyriproxyfen did not cause brain malformation nor any significant changes in the number of observed stem cells in the developing central nervous system.

The study was performed on 60 male autistic patients recruited from the Pediatric Department of Al-Sader General Hospital, Baghdad, Iraq between November 2014 and April 2015. The levels of oxytocin and melatonin were measured in the serum of these autistic male patients, and categorized as mild, moderate, and severe (20 patients each), and was compared with 26 age- and gender-matched control subjects.Results:The data indicated that the levels of oxytocin (44.72 ± 36.1 µIU/mL) and melatonin in patients (23.08 ± 10.41 pg/mL) were significantly lower (p<0.05) than that of age-matched (102.1 ± 34.31 µIU/mL) and gender-matched controls (53.05 ± 38.38 pg/mL). These parameters were remarkably associated with the severity of the disease that was indicated by the significant decrease in the levels of oxytocin (47 ± 25.47 µIU/mL) and melatonin in moderate (20 ± 6.14 pg/mL), and patients with severe oxytocin (27.92 ± 10.23 µIU/mL) and patients with severe melatonin (21.69 ± 7.02 pg/mL) when compared with mild autistic patients with oxytocin (59.22 ± 27.32 µIU/mL) and melatonin (27.55 ± 14.71 pg/mL).

The aim here was to determine the effect of acutely correcting the peripheral vasodilatory capacity of aged skin on the integrated cardiovascular responses to passive heating. A secondary aim was to examine the SkBF-Qc relation during hyperthermia in the presence (upright posture) and absence (dynamic exercise) of challenges to central venous pressure. We hypothesized that greater increases in SkBF would be accompanied by greater increases in Qc. Eleven healthy older adults (69 ± 3 yr) underwent supine passive heating (0.8°C rise in core temperature; water-perfused suit) after ingesting sapropterin (BH4, a nitric oxide synthase cofactor; 10 mg/kg) or placebo (randomized double-blind crossover design). Twelve young (24 ± 1 yr) subjects served as a comparison group. SkBF (laser-Doppler flowmetry) and Qc (open-circuit acetylene wash-in) were measured during supine heating, heating + upright posture, and heating + dynamic exercise. Throughout supine and upright heating, sapropterin fully restored the SkBF response of older adults to that of young adults but Qc remained blunted. During heat + upright posture, SkBF failed to decrease in untreated older subjects. There were no age- or treatment-related differences in SkBF-Qc during dynamic exercise. The principal finding of this study was that the blunted Qc response to passive heat stress is directly related to age as opposed to the blunted peripheral vasodilatory capacity of aged skin. Furthermore, peripheral impairments to SkBF in the aged may contribute to inapposite responses during challenges to central venous pressure during hyperthermia.Keywords: heat stress, tilt, age, cutaneous vasodilation, central venous pressure, exercise",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4683344/,abstract

While it is common for consumers to ingest alcohol with other stimulant drugs (e.g., caffeine, nicotine), little is known if prototypical alcohol-induced balance impairments are altered by stimulant drugs. The purpose of this study was to examine if the coadministration of a high caffeine energy drink with alcohol can antagonize expected alcohol-induced increases in body sway.MethodsSixteen social drinkers (of equal gender) participated in four separate double-blind dose administration sessions that involved consumption of alcohol and energy drinks, alone and in combination. Following dose administration, participants completed automated assessments of balance stability (both eyes open and eyes closed) measured using the Biosway Portable Balance System (Biodex Medical Systems, Inc.). Participants completed several subjective measures including self-reported ratings of sedation, stimulation, fatigue and impairment. Blood pressure and pulse rate were recorded repeatedly.ResultsThe acute administration of alcohol increased body sway and the coadministration of energy drinks antagonized this impairment. When participants closed their eyes, alcohol-induced body sway was similar whether or not energy drinks were ingested. While alcohol administration increased ratings of sedation and fatigue, energy drink administration increased ratings of stimulation and reduced ratings of fatigue. Modest increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure following energy drink administration were also observed.ConclusionsVisual assessment of balance impairment is frequently used to indicate that an individual has consumed too much alcohol (e.g., as part of police standardized field sobriety testing or by a bartender assessing when someone should no longer be served more alcohol). The current findings suggest that energy drinks can antagonize alcohol-induced increases in body sway, indicating that future work is needed to determine if this observation regarding neuromotor functioning applies to alcohol in combination with all types of stimulant drugs.Keywords: Alcohol, Energy Drinks, Balance, Motor Control, Blood Pressure",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5750124/,abstract

The available variables included: age, treatment duration, household income, gender, ethnicity, religion, diagnosis, and phase of treatment. It is hypothesized that the relationships will be significant. In the current study, there were 60 patients (60% males) with leukemia; their ages ranged from 1 to 21 years (Mean = 8.03, Standard Deviation = 4.55). The hypothesis was partially supported. Age had a significant positive relationship with physical functioning, r(60) = 0.28, p < 0.05, physical health, r(60) = 0.28, p < 0.05, and the total HRQoL score, r(60) = 0.29, p < 0.05. Treatment duration had a positive relationship with school functioning, r(60) = 0.28, p < 0.05. All other correlations were statistically non-significant. The effects of the available psychosocial variables of gender, ethnicity, and religion were examined on scores from the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). Ethnicity had a significant effect on social functioning, U = 292.00, p < 0.05, r = 0.3 (medium effect size). Specifically, Chinese (Median = 85.00, n = 33) had significantly higher scores on social functioning than others (Median = 70.00, n = 27). The remaining comparisons were statistically non-significant. The current findings added to QoL research, and provided an impetus for more research in the area of HRQoL for children with leukemia in Singapore.Keywords: Leukemia, pediatric, health-related quality of life, age",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617504/,abstract

of phenylalanine arising from defects in steps to convert phenylalanine to
tyrosine. Phe accumulation causes severe mental retardation that can be
prevented by timely identification of affected individuals and their placement
on a Phe-restricted diet. In spite of many studies in patients and animal
models, the basis for acquisition of mental retardation during the critical
period of brain development is not adequately understood. All animal models for
human disease have advantages and limitations, and characteristics common to
different models are most likely to correspond to the disorder. This study
established similar levels of Phe exposure in developing rats between 3 and 16
days of age using three models to produce chronic hyperphenylalanemia, and
identified changes in brain amino acid levels common to all models that persist
for ~16h of each day. In a representative model, local rates of glucose
utilization (CMRglc) were determined at 25–27 days of age,
and only selective changes that appeared to depend on Phe exposure were
observed. CMRglc was reduced in frontal cortex and thalamus and
increased in hippocampus and globus pallidus. Behavioral testing to evaluate
neuromuscular competence revealed poor performance in
chronically-hyperphenylalanemic rats that persisted for at least three weeks
after cessation of Phe injections and did not occur with mild or acute
hyperphenylalanemia. Thus, the abnormal amino acid environment, including
hyperglycinemia, in developing rat brain is associated with selective regional
changes in glucose utilization and behavioral abnormalities that are not readily
reversed after they are acquired.Keywords: amino acids, behavior, brain development, glucose utilization, hyperphenylalaninemia, hyperglycinemia, phenylketonuria",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4733436/,abstract

Under optimized conditions, microencapsulated cells presented uniform size distribution, good sphericity, and a smooth surface with different cell densities. The particle size distribution was determined at 150–280 μm, with an average particle diameter of 220 μm. The microencapsulated cells were cultured under static, shaking, and 3D micro-gravity conditions with or without bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) treatment. The quantified detection (cell proliferation detection and glycosaminoglycan (GAG)/type II collagen (Col-II)) content was respectively determined by cell counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) and dimethylmethylene blue (DMB)/Col-II secretion determination) and qualitative detection (acridine orange/ethidium bromide, hematoxylin-eosin, alcian blue, safranin-O, and immunohistochemistry staining) of these microencapsulated cells were evaluated. Results showed that microencapsulated C5.18 cells under three-dimensional microgravity conditions promoted cells to form large cell aggregates within 20 days by using bFGF, which provided the possibility for cartilage tissue constructs in vitro. It could be found from the cell viability (cell proliferation) and synthesis (content of GAG and Col-II) results that microencapsulated cells had a better cell proliferation under 3D micro-gravity conditions using bFGF than under 2D conditions (including static and shaking conditions).

By preserving the native recipient liver and decreasing hospitalization time, this innovative approach has progressively gained interest among clinicians. LCT initially targets inborn errors of liver metabolism, enabling the compensation of deficient metabolic functions for up to 18 months post-transplantation, supporting its use at least as a bridge to transplantation. The rigorous clinical development and widespread use of LCT depends strongly on controlled and consistent clinical trial data, which may help improve several critical factors, including the standardization of raw biological material and immunosuppression regimens. Substantial effort has also been made in defining and optimizing the most efficient cell population to be transplanted in the liver setting. Although isolated hepatocytes remain the best cell type, showing positive clinical results, their widespread use is hampered by their poor resistance to both cryopreservation and in vitro culture, as well as ever-more-significant donor shortages. Hence, there is considerable interest in developing more standardized and widely accessible cell medicinal products to improve engraftment permanency and post-cell transplantation metabolic effects.SignificanceIn this therapeutic approach to liver disease, new solutions are being designed and evaluated to bypass the documented limitations and move forward toward wide clinical use.

BH4 biosynthesis requires the sequential action of the conserved enzymes Punch, Purple, and Sepiapterin Reductase (Sptr). Although we observe increased feeding upon loss of Punch and Purple in the adult fat body, loss of Sptr must occur in the brain. We found Sptr expression is required in four adult neurons that express neuropeptide F (NPF), the fly homologue of the vertebrate appetite regulator neuropeptide Y (NPY). As expected, feeding flies BH4 rescues the loss of Punch and Purple in the fat body and the loss of Sptr in NPF neurons. Mechanistically, we found BH4 deficiency reduces NPF staining, likely by promoting its release, while excess BH4 increases NPF accumulation without altering its expression. We thus show that, because of its physically distributed biosynthesis, BH4 acts as a fat-derived signal that induces satiety by inhibiting the activity of the NPF neurons.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5369665/,abstract

Monitoring for graft function and rejection has been difficult, and has contributed to limited graft survival.MethodsPreparative hepatic irradiation was examined in non-human primates as a strategy to improve engraftment of donor hepatocytes, and was then applied in human subjects. T-cell immune monitoring was also examined in human subjects to assess adequacy of immunosuppression.ResultsPorcine hepatocyte transplants engrafted and expanded to comprise up to 15% of irradiated segments in immunosuppressed monkeys preconditioned with 10Gy liver-directed irradiation. Two patients with urea cycle deficiencies had early graft loss following hepatocyte transplantation; retrospective immune monitoring suggested the need for additional immunosuppression. Preparative radiation, anti-lymphocyte induction, and frequent immune monitoring were instituted for hepatocyte transplantation in a 27-year old female with classical phenylketonuria. Post-transplant liver biopsies demonstrated multiple small clusters of transplanted cells, multiple mitoses, and Ki67+ hepatocytes. Mean peripheral blood phenylalanine (PHE) level fell from pre-transplant levels of 1343 ± 48μM (normal 30-119μM) to 854 ± 25μM (treatment goal ≤360μM) after transplant (36% decrease; p<0.0001), despite transplantation of only half the target number of donor hepatocytes.

Increased brain phenylalanine concentration likely competitively inhibits the activities of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the rate limiting steps in dopamine and serotonin synthesis respectively. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a required cofactor for TH and TPH activity. Our hypothesis was that treatment of hyperphenylalaninemic Pahenu2/enu2 mice, a model of human PKU, with sapropterin dihydrochloride, a synthetic form of BH4, would stimulate TH and TPH activities leading to improved dopamine and serotonin synthesis despite persistently elevated brain phenylalanine. Sapropterin (20, 40, or 100 mg/kg body weight in 1% ascorbic acid) was administered daily for 4 days by oral gavage to Pahenu2/enu2 mice followed by measurement of brain biopterin, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan and monoamine neurotransmitter content. A significant increase in brain biopterin content was detected only in mice that had received the highest sapropterin dose, 100 mg/kg. Blood and brain phenylalanine concentrations were unchanged by sapropterin therapy. Sapropterin therapy also did not alter the absolute amounts of dopamine and serotonin in brain but was associated with increased homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), dopamine and serotonin metabolites respectively, in both wild type and Pahenu2/enu2 mice.

We investigated the associations between these processes, using data obtained by positron emission tomography with l-[1-11C]-tyrosine (11C-Tyr) as a tracer. Blood-to-brain transport of non-Phe LNAAs was modeled by the rate constant for 11C-Tyr transport from arterial plasma to brain tissue (K1), while CPS was modeled by the rate constant for 11C-Tyr incorporation into cerebral protein (k3). Brain phenylalanine concentrations were measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in three volumes of interest (VOIs): supraventricular brain tissue (VOI 1), ventricular brain tissue (VOI 2), and fluid-containing ventricular voxels (VOI 3). The associations between k3 and each predictor variable were analyzed by multiple linear regression. The rate constant k3 was inversely associated with brain phenylalanine concentrations in VOIs 2 and 3 (adjusted R2=0.826, F=19.936, P=0.021). Since brain phenylalanine concentrations in these VOIs highly correlated with each other, the specific associations of each predictor with k3 could not be determined. The associations between k3 and plasma phenylalanine concentration, K1, and brain phenylalanine concentrations in VOI 1 were nonsignificant. In conclusion, our study shows an inverse association between k3 and increased brain phenylalanine concentrations.Keywords: blood–brain barrier, cerebral protein synthesis, large neutral amino acid, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, phenylketonuria, positron emission tomography",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4426736/,abstract

LC‐MS/MS and the dried blood spot (DBS) technique were used for the analysis of blood samples from coffee and noncoffee drinkers (n = 50), and food frequency questionnaires were used to document coffee consumption.Methods and resultsFor the detection of OTA and 2’R‐OTA in blood, a new sensitive and efficient sample preparation method based on DBS was established and validated. Using this technique 2’R‐OTA was for the first time detected in biological samples. Comparison between coffee drinkers and noncoffee drinkers showed for the first time that 2’R‐OTA was only present in blood from the first group while OTA could be found in both groups in a mean concentration of 0.21 μg/L. 2’R‐OTA mean concentration was 0.11 μg/L with a maximum concentration of 0.414 μg/L. Thus, in average 2’R‐OTA was approx. half the concentration of OTA but in some cases even exceeded OTA levels. No correlation between the amounts of coffee consumption and OTA or 2’R‐OTA levels was observed.ConclusionThe results of this study revealed for the first time a high exposure of coffee consumers to 2’R‐OTA, a compound formed from OTA during coffee roasting. Since little information is available regarding toxicity and possible carcinogenicity of this compound, further OTA monitoring in blood including 2’R‐OTA is advisable.Keywords: Coffee, Dried blood spot, Exposure, Mycotoxin, Ochratoxin",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4744763/,abstract

Evidence is presented to show that fluoride (F) inhibits Na+, K+-ATPase activity by altering biological pathways through modifying the expression of genes and the activity of glycolytic enzymes, metalloenzymes, hormones, proteins, neuropeptides and cytokines, as well as biological interface interactions that rely on the bioavailability of chemical elements magnesium and manganese to modulate ATP and Na+, K+-ATPase enzyme activity.

In cognitive aging studies, results are inconsistent: some studies report an increase in dispersion with increasing age and decline in performance, while others report an increasingly homogenous cognitive profile in older adults. We propose that inconsistencies may reflect qualitative differences in the cognitive functioning of the aging brain: age-groups may differ in how efficiently they engage resources, depending on both executive processing and resources available. This in turn would result in either greater or less dispersion. 21 young (mean 25.14 years, SD ± 2.85), 21 middle-old (65.05 ± 4.19), and 20 old-old (80.65 ± 4.38) healthy adults completed a series of neuropsychological tasks engaging executive processing, including switching, planning, updating, working memory and short-term memory. Individual dispersion profiles were obtained using a regression method which computes individual standard deviation across tasks from standardized test scores. Results revealed associations between performance, dispersion and cognitive reserve (measured as education level). Although differences across groups did not approach significance, there was a general pattern consistent with existing literature showing greater dispersion in the old-old group, and this was negatively associated with performance. In contrast, the middle-old group showed young-equivalent dispersion index, while performance was similar to the young group on some tasks and to the old-old group on others, possibly reflecting differences in cognitive demand. Educational level positively correlated with performance in the middle-old group only. Overall, a distinct pattern emerged for the middle-old adults: they showed young-equivalent performance on a number of measures and similar dispersion index, while uniquely benefitting from cognitive reserve. This may possibly reflect engagement in compensatory mechanisms. This study contributes to clarifying inconsistencies in previous studies and calls for more thoughtful selection of sample cohorts in aging research. The study of dispersion may provide a behavioral index of age-related changes in how cognition functions and recruits resources. Future work could examine whether this also reflects age-related changes in neural recruitment and aim at identifying factors contributing to cognitive reserve, in order to prolong good performance and improve cognition in aging.Keywords: intra-individual variability, dispersion, fluid cognition, executive functions, aging, compensation, cognitive reserve, education",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6198726/,abstract

These treatment options, however, are extremely expensive and are needed for life thus presenting an economical as well as ethical challenge to the affected families and the health care system of a country. This paper presents a case for the prevention of the lysosomal storage disorders as a model for other inherited metabolic disorders in the form of antenatal testing and cascade screeningfor couples and families at risk of having affected off-springs and compares it to the cost incurred on the enzyme replacement therapy in the backdrop of the health care prioritiesof Pakistan, a low middle income country.

The National PKU Alliance (NPKUA) conducted a survey of its membership to assess current health status and interest in new treatments for PKU. Of the 625 survey respondents, less than half (46.7%) reported blood Phe within (120–360 μmol/L) — the range recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). The survey results also showed that younger (≤ 18 years) individuals were about 3-times as successful in keeping their blood Phe concentrations within the recommended clinical range compared with adults. Blood Phe over 360 μmol/L was reported in one-quarter (25.5%) of ≤ 18 year old individuals and almost two-thirds (61.5%) of adults. A little more than half (51.7%) of respondents reported having difficulty in managing their PKU, including the maintenance of a Phe-restricted diet. Individuals with PKU desire new treatments that would allow them to increase their intake of natural protein, discontinue or reduce their intake of medical foods (medical formula and foods modified to be low in protein), improve their mental health (including a reduction in depression and anxiety), and a reduction of their blood Phe concentrations. Respondents preferred oral administration of any newly developed therapies and, in general, disliked therapeutic injections. Injections at home were preferred over injections at a clinic.

Besides splice mutations in the well-conserved splice sites, mutations in splicing regulatory elements (SREs) may deregulate splicing and cause disease. A promising therapeutic approach is to compensate for this deregulation by blocking other SREs with splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs). However, the location and sequence of most SREs are not well known.ResultsHere, we used individual-nucleotide resolution crosslinking immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) to establish an in vivo binding map for the key splicing regulatory factor hnRNP A1 and to generate an hnRNP A1 consensus binding motif. We find that hnRNP A1 binding in proximal introns may be important for repressing exons. We show that inclusion of the alternative cassette exon 3 in SKA2 can be significantly increased by SSO-based treatment which blocks an iCLIP-identified hnRNP A1 binding site immediately downstream of the 5’ splice site. Because pseudoexons are well suited as models for constitutive exons which have been inactivated by pathogenic mutations in SREs, we used a pseudoexon in MTRR as a model and showed that an iCLIP-identified hnRNP A1 binding site downstream of the 5′ splice site can be blocked by SSOs to activate the exon.ConclusionsThe hnRNP A1 binding map can be used to identify potential targets for SSO-based therapy. Moreover, together with the hnRNP A1 consensus binding motif, the binding map may be used to predict whether disease-associated mutations and SNPs affect hnRNP A1 binding and eventually mRNA splicing.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12915-016-0279-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: hnRNP A1, iCLIP, Splicing splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs), Pseudoexons, Alternative splicing, Splicing silencer, Cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP), RNA-seq, Surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi)",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4932749/,abstract

Gene transfer of CARs to T-cells has widely relied on retroviral vectors, but transposon-based gene transfer has recently emerged as a suitable nonviral method to mediate stable transgene expression. The advantages of transposon vectors compared with viral vectors include their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. We used the Tol2 transposon system to stably transfer CD19-CAR into human T-cells. Normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes were co-nucleofected with the Tol2 transposon donor plasmid carrying CD19-CAR and the transposase expression plasmid and were selectively propagated on NIH3T3 cells expressing human CD19. Expanded CD3+ T-cells with stable and high-level transgene expression (~95%) produced interferon-γ upon stimulation with CD19 and specifically lysed Raji cells, a CD19+ human B-cell lymphoma cell line. Adoptive transfer of these T-cells suppressed tumor progression in Raji tumor-bearing Rag2−/−γc−/− immunodeficient mice compared with control mice.

In former studies, a ratio between branched-chain and aromatic amino acids (Fischer’s ratio) revealed associations with hepatic encephalopathy. Furthermore, low concentrations of branched-chain amino acids were linked to sarcopenia in literature. Encephalopathy and sarcopenia are known to dramatically worsen the prognosis. Aim of this study was to investigate a complex panel of plasma amino acids in the context of mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease.Methods166 patients evaluated for orthotopic liver transplantation were included. 19 amino acids were measured from citrated plasma samples using mass spectrometry. We performed survival analysis for plasma amino acid constellations and examined the relationship to established mortality predictors.Results33/166 (19.9%) patients died during follow-up. Lower values of valine (p<0.001), Fischer’s ratio (p<0.001) and valine to phenylalanine ratio (p<0.001) and higher values of phenylalanine (p<0.05) and tyrosine (p<0.05) were significantly associated with mortality. When divided in three groups, the tertiles discriminated cumulative survival for valine (p = 0.016), phenylalanine (p = 0.024) and in particular for valine to phenylalanine ratio (p = 0.003) and Fischer’s ratio (p = 0.005). Parameters were also significantly correlated with MELD and MELD-Na score.ConclusionsAmino acids in plasma are valuable biomarkers to determine increased risk of mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease. In particular, valine concentrations and constellations composed of branched-chain and aromatic amino acids were strongly associated with prognosis. Due to their pathophysiological importance, the identified amino acids could be used to examine individual dietary recommendations to serve as potential therapeutic targets.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4943589/,abstract

Biotinidase (BTD) catalyzes the recycling of biotin from endogenous and dietary sources. Biotinidase deficiency (BD) is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder of biotin recycling that is associated with neurologic and cutaneous consequences when untreated. The aim of the study was to compare the results of spectrophotometric and fluorimetric methods, as well as to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of both methods in current research practices.MethodsStudy group was chosen among the BD suspected newborn, children and parents (n = 52) who applied to Hacettepe University Pediatric Metabolism Unit.ResultsBTD activity is stable for 2 hours at room temperature and at 4 °C, and for 4 months at –20 °C and –80 °C. Genetic and clinical results showed that 25% of the total number of patients had complete BD which was treated with 10 mg/day biotin, while 15.38% of the patients had partial BD, and they were prescribed biotin 5 mg/day. The area under the ROC curve was 0.960±0.25 and 0.927± 0.41 for the fluorimetric and spectrophotometric method, respectively. Fluorimetric method showed 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity, whereas spectrophotometric method showed 90.5% sensitivity and 93.7% specificity.ConclusionsFluorimetric method is superior to the spectrophotometric method due to higher sensitivity and specificity.Keywords: biotinidase, enzyme deficiency, spectrophotometry, fluorimetry",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5346788/,abstract

However, the market is still dominated by prokaryotic and mammalian expression systems, the former offering high production capacity at a low cost, and the latter favored for the production of complex biopharmaceutical products. Although plant systems are now gaining widespread acceptance as a platform for the larger-scale production of recombinant proteins, there is still resistance to commercial uptake. This partly reflects the relatively low yields achieved in plants, as well as inconsistent product quality and difficulties with larger-scale downstream processing. Furthermore, there are only a few cases in which plants have demonstrated economic advantages compared to established and approved commercial processes, so industry is reluctant to switch to plant-based production. Nevertheless, some plant-derived proteins for research or cosmetic/pharmaceutical applications have reached the market, showing that plants can excel as a competitive production platform in some niche areas. Here, we discuss the strengths of plant expression systems for specific applications, but mainly address the bottlenecks that must be overcome before plants can compete with conventional systems, enabling the future commercial utilization of plants for the production of valuable proteins.Keywords: cell-free biosynthesis, CHO cells, molecular farming, plant-made pharmaceuticals, Pseudomonas fluorescens",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6579924/,abstract

However, ethnicity affects human disease and environment-gene interactions, including nutrient intake. Historically, isolated human populations with different genetic backgrounds have adapted to distinct environments with varying food sources. Ethnicity is relevant to the interaction of food intake with genes and disease susceptibility; yet major health agencies generally do not recommend food and nutrients codified by population genotypes and their frequencies. In this paper, we have consolidated published nutrigenetic variants and examine their frequencies in human superpopulations to prioritize these variants for future investigation of population-specific genotype-directed nutrition. The nutrients consumed by individuals interact with their genome and may alter disease risk. Herein, we searched the literature, designed a data model, and manually curated hundreds of papers. The resulting database houses 101 variants that reached significance (p < 0.05), from 35 population studies. Nutrigenetic variants associated with modified nutrient intake have the potential to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and several other diseases. Since many nutrigenetic studies have identified a major variant in some populations, we suggest that superpopulation-specific genotype-directed nutrition modifications be prioritized for future study and evaluation.

Accordingly, this study investigated visual function and color perception in adolescents with ADHD using color Visual Evoked Potentials (cVEP), which provides an objective measure of color perception.MethodThirty-one adolescents (aged 13–18), 16 with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, and 15 healthy peers, matched for age, gender, and IQ participated in the study. All underwent an ophthalmological exam, as well as electrophysiological testing color Visual Evoked Potentials (cVEP), which measured the latency and amplitude of the neural P1 response to chromatic (blue–yellow, red–green) and achromatic stimuli.ResultNo intergroup differences were found in the ophthalmological exam. However, significantly larger P1 amplitude was found for blue and yellow stimuli, but not red/green or achromatic stimuli, in the ADHD group (particularly in the medicated group) compared to controls.ConclusionLarger amplitude in the P1 component for blue–yellow in the ADHD group compared to controls may account for the lack of difference in color perception tasks.

As additional findings, he presented recurrent seizures and pubertal gynecomastia. His mother was phenotypically normal and had completely skewed inactivation of the duplicated X chromosome, as most female carriers of such duplications. Five previously reported patients with partial Xq duplications presented duplication breakpoints similar to those of our patient. One of them, a fetus with multiple congenital abnormalities, had the same cytogenetic duplication breakpoint. Three of the reported patients shared many features with our proband but the other had some clinical features of the Prader-Willi syndrome. It was suggested that ATRX overexpression could be involved in the major clinical features of patients with partial Xq duplications. We propose that this gene could also be involved with the obesity of the patient with the Prader-Willi-like phenotype. Additionally, we suggest that the PCDH11X gene could be a candidate for our patient's recurrent seizures.

A sipping device (sipometer) was developed that permits access to a liquid food or beverage on two reward schedules: continuous reinforcement (CR) and progressively increasing time spent exerting pressure on a straw (PR-schedule). In addition, a pictorial scale showing a cup, from which the ‘amount wanted’ could be marked was used to pre-test potential consumption. Intake, time spent sipping, breakpoint, and pressure exerted were the main dependent variables measured. Three pilot experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, participants (n = 8) consumed yogurt shakes after a 1-h or 21-h food deprivation period on both schedules. In Experiment 2, participants (n = 8) sham-consumed (i.e. spit out) sweet and non-sweet beverages, utilizing both schedules. In Experiment 3, sham-consuming sweet and non-sweet beverages on both schedules and working for shake on the PR schedule were repeated, after three nights of either habitual sleep or short sleep duration (n = 7) in a crossover design. In Experiment 1, participants sipped longer after 21-h vs. 1-h of food deprivation (13 ± 3.0 vs. 8.0 ± 2.1 s; p = 0.04), on the PR schedule. In Experiment 2, sham-intake (p = 0.01) and sipping time (p = 0.04) were greater for sweet than non-sweet beverages on the PR schedule and a similar, though not conventionally significant, effect was observed for exerted pressure (p = 0.09). In both Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 after habitual sleep, on the PR schedule, cumulative pressure difference between sweet and non-sweet beverage increased with difference in amount wanted in the taste test. In contrast, after short sleep participants were less willing to work for sweet taste as their wanting increased, suggesting that sleep deprivation raises desire, but lowers behavioral output. Taken together these results demonstrate that the sipometer and associated ratings are reliable and useful measures of motivation to consume and reward value in humans. Participants were more motivated to obtain access to sweet beverages, especially when these were better liked than to obtain access to non-sweet beverages.Keywords: Reward, Reinforcing value, Motivation, Consummatory behavior, Liking wanting",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5769686/,abstract

However, the fundamental mechanism behind the origin of such diverse health problems, particularly the issue of how they are related to the build-up of phenylalanine molecules in the body, is largely unknown. Here, we show cross-seeding ability of phenylalanine fibrils that can effectively initiate an aggregation process in proteins under physiological conditions, converting native protein structures to β-sheet assembly. The resultant fibrils were found to cause severe hemolysis, yielding a plethora of deformed erythrocytes that is highly relevant to phenylketonuria. Unique arrangement of zwitterionic phenylalanine molecules in their amyloid-like higher order entities is predicted to promote both hydrophobic and electrostatic interaction, sufficient enough to trap proteins and to preferentially interact with the membrane components of RBCs. Since the prevalence of hemolysis and amyloid related psychoneurological severities are mostly observed in PKU patients, we propose that the inherent property of phenylalanine fibrils to trigger hemolysis and to induce protein aggregation may have direct relevance to the disease mechanism of PKU.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5593866/,abstract

Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies have identified > 50 susceptibility loci for common type 1 diabetes (T1D) and approximately 100 susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes (T2D). About 1–5% of all cases of diabetes result from single-gene mutations and are called monogenic diabetes. Here, we review the pathophysiological basis of the role of monogenic diabetes genes that have also been found to be associated with common T1D and/or T2D. Variants of approximately one-third of monogenic diabetes genes are associated with T2D, but not T1D. Two of the T2D-associated monogenic diabetes genes—potassium inward-rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11 (KCNJ11), which controls glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the β-cell; and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG), which impacts multiple tissue targets in relation to inflammation and insulin sensitivity—have been developed as major antidiabetic drug targets. Another monogenic diabetes gene, the preproinsulin gene (INS), is unique in that INS mutations can cause hyperinsulinemia, hyperproinsulinemia, neonatal diabetes mellitus, one type of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY10), and autoantibody-negative T1D. Dominant heterozygous INS mutations are the second most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes. Moreover, INS gene variants are strongly associated with common T1D (type 1a), but inconsistently with T2D. Variants of the monogenic diabetes gene Gli-similar 3 (GLIS3) are associated with both T1D and T2D. GLIS3 is a key transcription factor in insulin production and β-cell differentiation during embryonic development, which perturbation forms the basis of monogenic diabetes as well as its association with T1D. GLIS3 is also required for compensatory β-cell proliferation in adults; impairment of this function predisposes to T2D. Thus, monogenic forms of diabetes are invaluable “human models” that have contributed to our understanding of the pathophysiological basis of common T1D and T2D.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4890265/,abstract

Recent advances in biotechnology and genetic testing mean that the investigations available to perform for children under 5 years are increasing and are more sensitive than previously. This change in availability and type of testing necessitates an update in the recommendations for investigating GDD.MethodsWe conducted a review of the literature from 2006 to 2016 to identify articles with evidence relating to the investigation of developmental delay in children under the age of 5 years. We collated the evidence into first-line and second-line investigations and, where available, on their yield and cost implications.ResultsWe have provided up-to-date guidance for first-line and second-line investigations for children with GDD under the age of 5 years. Recent evidence demonstrates that genetic testing for all children with unexplained GDD should be first line, if an exogenous cause is not already established. Our review of the literature demonstrates that all patients, irrespective of severity of GDD, should have investigations for treatable conditions. Evidence demonstrates that the yield for treatable conditions is higher than previously thought and that investigations for these metabolic conditions should be considered as first line. Additional second-line investigations can be led by history, examination and developmental trajectories.DiscussionWe may need to update present recommendations in the UK for investigation of developmental delay.

When the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the revision process of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), a Topic Advisory Group for rare diseases was established, managed by Orphanet and funded by the European Commission.ResultsSo far 5,400 rare diseases listed in the Orphanet database have an endorsed representation in the foundation layer of ICD-11, and are thus provided with a unique identifier in the Beta version of ICD-11, which is 10 times more than in ICD10. A rare disease linearization is also planned. The current beta version is open for public consultation and comments, and to be used for field testing. The adoption by the World Health Assembly is planned for 2017.ConclusionsThe overall revision process was carried out with very limited means considering its scope, ambition and strategic significance, and experienced significant hurdles and setbacks. The lack of funding impacted the level of professionalism that could be attained. The contrast between the initially declared goals and the currently foreseen final product is disappointing. In the context of uncertainty around the outcome of the field testing and the potential willingness of countries to adopt this new version, the European Commission Expert Group on Rare Diseases adopted in November 2014 a recommendation for health care coding systems to consider using ORPHA codes in addition to ICD10 codes for rare diseases having no specific ICD10 codes.

Using multivariate regression analysis by backward LR, Zweight and birth weight were noted as the predicting factors of refractory epilepsies.ConclusionThis effect may be because of leptin.

Substantial clinical evidence indicates that intravenous BH4 restores vascular function in patients. Unfortunately, oral BH4 has limited efficacy. Therefore, orally bioavailable pharmacological activators of endogenous BH4 biosynthesis hold significant therapeutic potential. GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1), the rate limiting enzyme in BH4 synthesis, forms a protein complex with GCH1 feedback regulatory protein (GFRP). This complex is subject to allosteric feed-forward activation by L-phenylalanine (L-phe). We investigated the effects of L-phe on the biophysical interactions of GCH1 and GFRP and its potential to alter BH4 levels in vivo.Experimental ApproachDetailed characterization of GCH1–GFRP protein–protein interactions were performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with or without L-phe. Effects on systemic and vascular BH4 biosynthesis in vivo were investigated following L-phe treatment (100 mg·kg−1, p.o.).Key ResultsGCH1 and GFRP proteins interacted in the absence of known ligands or substrate but the presence of L-phe doubled maximal binding and enhanced binding affinity eightfold. Furthermore, the complex displayed very slow association and dissociation rates. In vivo, L-phe challenge induced a sustained elevation of aortic BH4, an effect absent in GCH1(fl/fl)-Tie2Cre mice.Conclusions and ImplicationsBiophysical data indicate that GCH1 and GFRP are constitutively bound. In vivo, data demonstrated that L-phe elevated vascular BH4 in an endothelial GCH1 dependent manner. Pharmacological agents which mimic the allosteric effects of L-phe on the GCH1–GFRP complex have the potential to elevate endothelial BH4 biosynthesis for numerous cardiovascular disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4543619/,abstract

The region is the most inequitable in the world, with an average Gini Index of 52.5 and 25 % of the population living in poverty. Health expenditures are low and health systems are fragmented and privatised, with curtailed governmental responsibility and regulation. Health-care decision making is mostly in the hands of private insurance corporations and the medical-industrial complex, so that what is (or is not) covered by health plans is arbitrary and determined by the market and not by population health needs. This inequity and the lack of meaningful governmental intervention in the provision of health care, including genetic services, are at the heart of the bioethical dilemmas in Latin America. It is not surprising, therefore, that bioethics in the region has developed an approach grounded in social justice, equity and human rights as guiding principles, in contrast to the individualism espoused by Anglo-Saxon bioethics. The main ethical issues identified in genetics in Latin America are (1) inequity in access to genetic services, particularly in prenatal diagnosis, (2) genetic discrimination and (3) the lack of adherence to internationally accepted requisites of clinical validity and utility for diagnostic and predictive genetic testing. In this context, there is a risk that the impressive advances in genetics/genomics occurring in developed countries may fail to improve the public’s health and deepen inequity, with the implementation of expensive genetic technologies of unproven validity.Keywords: Bioethics and genetics, Public health, Genetic services, Equity, Latin America, Argentina",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4524838/,abstract

However, they have adverse effects like reduced appetite. We investigated the effects of folic acid on reduced appetite caused by the use of methylphenidate in children with ADHD.Methods:This randomized double-blind clinical trial evaluated 70 outpatients, aged between 6 and 12 years, with a diagnosis of ADHD. The children were recruited from the Outpatient Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinic of Golestan Hospital (Ahwaz, Iran) between 2016 and 2017. The study subjects were randomly assigned to 2 groups: Group 1 received an average dose of methylphenidate (1 mg/kg) plus folic acid (5 mg/d) and Group 2 received an average dose of methylphenidate (1 mg/kg) plus a placebo (5 mg of sucrose) for 8 weeks. Assessments, comprising the Conners Parent Questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, and appetite questionnaire, were conducted by a psychiatrist at baseline and then at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after the medication was started using repeated measure analysis. The data were analyzed with the Mann–Whitney U and ANOVA tests using the SPSS statistical software (v. 18.0).Results:Age and gender were not associated with the groups. Weight, height, and the body mass index were not changed during the study in both groups. ADHD symptoms significantly decreased in both groups during the trial; however, no difference was observed between the groups. Moreover, appetite was significantly improved in Group 1.

Many conditions covered by newborn screening represent classic (autosomal recessive) Mendelian disorders. Parents of screen-positive infants therefore often come to learn that they are carriers of the disease, and face a decision whether to test for it in future pregnancies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2015–2017 with 34 Israeli parents whose child was screen positive. Three major themes emanated from the parents’ attitudes toward prenatal testing for the disease in prospective hypothetical pregnancies: rejection of prenatal testing for the disease associated with the screen positive, and relying instead on newborn screening to reveal if a future baby is also sick (18/34, 53%); support of prenatal testing to get more information (7/34, 21%) and support of prenatal testing in order to abort in case of a test positive (9/34, 26%). We discuss the importance of newborn screening for reproductive decision-making, highlighting the arguments associated with positive and negative parental views of the possibility of having another child with the same condition associated with the screen-positive of the child that had already been born. The conclusions challenge the common assertion that parents pursue the dream of the “perfect child” through prenatal diagnosis that “naturally” leads to selective abortion. The diversity of views expressed by Israeli parents of screen-positive children highlights the diversity of normative scripts of “genetic responsibility” in the context of parenthood.Keywords: Israel, Newborn screening, Prenatal genetic diagnosis, Disability, Reproductive decisions",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325039/,abstract

One intervention that can be used prior to a needle insertion procedure is application of a topical local anaesthetic.ObjectivesTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical anaesthetics such as amethocaine and EMLA in newborn term or preterm infants requiring an invasive procedure involving puncture of skin and other tissues with a needle.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase and CINAHL up to 15 May 2016; previous reviews including cross‐references, abstracts, and conference proceedings. We contacted expert informants. We contacted authors directly to obtain additional data. We imposed no language restrictions.Selection criteriaRandomised, quasi‐randomised controlled trials, and cluster and cross‐over randomised trials that compared the topical anaesthetics amethocaine and eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics (EMLA) in terms of anaesthetic efficacy and safety in newborn term or preterm infants requiring an invasive procedure involving puncture of skin and other tissues with a needleData collection and analysisFrom the reports of the clinical trials we extracted data regarding clinical outcomes including pain, number of infants with methaemoglobin level 5% and above, number of needle prick attempts prior to successful needle‐related procedure, crying, time taken to complete the procedure, episodes of apnoea, episodes of bradycardia, episodes of oxygen desaturation, neurodevelopmental disability and other adverse events.Main resultsEight small randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria (n = 506). These studies compared either EMLA and placebo or amethocaine and placebo. No studies compared EMLA and amethocaine. We were unable to meta‐analyse the outcome of pain due to differing outcome measures and methods of reporting. For EMLA, two individual studies reported a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to placebo during lumbar puncture and venepuncture. Three studies found no statistical difference between the groups during heel lancing. For amethocaine, three studies reported a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to placebo during venepuncture and one study reported a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to placebo during cannulation. One study reported no statistical difference between the two groups during intramuscular injection.One study reported no statistical difference between EMLA and the placebo group for successful venepuncture at first attempt. One study similarly reported no statistically significant difference between Amethocaine and the placebo group for successful cannulation at first attempt.Risk for local redness, swelling or blanching was significantly higher with EMLA (typical risk ratio (RR) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 2.19; typical risk difference (RD) 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.26; n = 272; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 6, 95% CI 4 to 11; I2 = 92% indicating considerable heterogeneity) although not for amethocaine (typical RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.72 to 6.16; typical RD 0.05, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.11, n = 221). These local skin reactions for EMLA and amethocaine were reported as short‐lasting. Two studies reported no methaemoglobinaemia with single application of EMLA.

However a recent prospective study reported a doubling of the risk of being overweight amongst 1-year old children whose mothers consumed NNS-sweetened beverages daily during pregnancy. We have previously shown that chronic aspartame (ASP) exposure commencing in utero may detrimentally affect adulthood adiposity status, glucose metabolism and aspects of behavior and spatial cognition, and that this can be modulated by developmental N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade with the competitive antagonist CGP 39551 (CGP). Since glucose homeostasis and certain aspects of behavior and locomotion are regulated in part by the NMDAR-rich hypothalamus, which is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal- (HPA) axis, we have elected to examine changes in hypothalamic and adrenal gene expression in response to ASP exposure in the presence or absence of developmental NMDAR antagonism with CGP, using Affymetrix microarray analysis.ResultsUsing 2-factor ANOVA we identified 189 ASP-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the adult male hypothalamus and 2188 in the adrenals, and a further 23 hypothalamic and 232 adrenal genes significantly regulated by developmental treatment with CGP alone. ASP exposure robustly elevated the expression of a network of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis, together with cell stress and inflammatory genes, consistent with previous reports of aspartame-induced CNS stress and oxidative damage. These genes were not differentially expressed in ASP mice with CGP antagonism. In the adrenal glands of ASP-exposed mice, GABA and Glutamate receptor subunit genes were amongst those most highly upregulated. Developmental NMDAR antagonism alone had less effect on adulthood gene expression and affected mainly hypothalamic neurogenesis and adrenal steroid metabolism. Combined ASP + CGP treatment mainly upregulated genes involved in adrenal drug and cholesterol metabolism.ConclusionASP exposure increased the expression of functional networks of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis and adrenal catecholamine synthesis, patterns of expression which were not present in ASP-exposed mice with developmental NMDAR antagonism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5862471/,abstract

However, these figures are likely to be affected by the current broader criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which have contributed to an increased prevalence of autism, with the result that the rate for ASD in epilepsy is likely to be higher and the figure for epilepsy in ASD is likely to be lower. Some evidence suggests that there are two peaks of epilepsy onset in autism, in infancy and adolescence. The rate of autism in epilepsy is much higher in those with intellectual disability. In conditions such as the Landau–Kleffner syndrome and nonconvulsive status epilepticus, the epilepsy itself may present with autistic features. There is no plausible mechanism for autism causing epilepsy, however. The co-occurrence of autism and epilepsy is almost certainly the result of underlying factors predisposing to both conditions, including both genetic and environmental factors. Conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and sleep disorders are common in both epilepsy and autism. Epilepsy is generally not a contraindication to treating these conditions with suitable medication, but it is important to take account of relevant drug interactions. One of the greatest challenges in autism is to determine why early childhood regression occurs in perhaps 25%. Further research should focus on finding the cause for such regression.

BH4 and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2) are metabolically interchangeable at the expense of NADPH. Exogenously administered BH4 can be metabolized by the body, similar to vitamins. At present, synthetic BH4 is used as an orphan drug for patients with inherited diseases requiring BH4 supplementation. BH4 supplementation has also drawn attention as a means of treating certain cardiovascular symptoms, however, its application in human patients remains limited. Here, we tracked biopterin (BP) distribution in blood, bile, urine, liver, kidney and brain after BH4 administration (5 mg/kg rat, i.v.) with or without prior treatment with probenecid, a potent inhibitor of uptake transporters particularly including organic anion transporter families such as OTA1 and OAT3. The rapid excretion of BP in urine was driven by elevated blood concentrations and its elimination reached about 90% within 120 min. In the very early period, BP was taken up by the liver and kidney and gradually released back to the blood. BH4 administration caused a considerable decrease in the BH4% in blood BP as an inevitable compensatory process. Probenecid treatment slowed down the decrease in blood BP and simultaneously inhibited its initial rapid excretion in the kidney. At the same time, the BH4% was further lowered, suggesting that the probenecid-sensitive BP uptake played a crucial role in BH2 scavenging in vivo. This suggested that the overproduced BH2 was taken up by organs by means of the probenecid-sensitive process, and was then scavenged by counter-conversion to BH4 via the BH4 salvage pathway. Taken together, BH4 administration was effective at raising BP levels in organs over the course of hours but with extremely low efficiency. Since a high BH2 relative to BH4 causes NOS dysfunction, the lowering of the BH4% must be avoided in practice, otherwise the desired effect of the supplementation in ameliorating NOS dysfunction would be spoiled.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5053593/,abstract

The potential use of whole-genome newborn screening (WG-NBS) as an alternative to the current biochemical testing utilized for NBS would dramatically expand the quantity and types of information parents could learn from screening and is likely to have many implications, both positive and negative. As whole-genome sequencing (WGS) becomes more economical, it probably will be used for the purposes of NBS. However, such an expansion of NBS would contradict many of the principles that have historically guided public health screening programs and, if implemented without sufficient preparation, could result in insufficient infrastructure to accommodate the health care and data management needs that would arise.

The majority of this information is expressed by probabilistic measures of association such as the odds ratio (OR) obtained by calculating differences in average “risk” between exposed and unexposed groups. However, recent research demonstrates that even ORs of considerable magnitude are insufficient for assessing the ability of risk factors or biomarkers to distinguish the individuals who will develop the disease from those who will not. In regards to coronary heart disease (CHD), we already know that novel biomarkers add very little to the discriminatory accuracy (DA) of traditional risk factors. However, the value added by traditional risk factors alongside simple demographic variables such as age and sex has been the subject of less discussion. Moreover, in public health, we use the OR to calculate the population attributable fraction (PAF), although this measure fails to consider the DA of the risk factor it represents. Therefore, focusing on CHD and applying measures of DA, we re-examine the role of individual demographic characteristics, risk factors, novel biomarkers and PAFs in public health and epidemiology. In so doing, we also raise a more general criticism of the traditional risk factors’ epidemiology. We investigated a cohort of 6103 men and women who participated in the baseline (1991–1996) of the Malmö Diet and Cancer study and were followed for 18 years. We found that neither traditional risk factors nor biomarkers substantially improved the DA obtained by models considering only age and sex. We concluded that the PAF measure provided insufficient information for the planning of preventive strategies in the population.

A genetic deficiency of this cofactor from mutations of biosynthetic or recycling enzymes is a well-recognized factor in the development of childhood neurological disorders characterized by motor impairments, developmental delay, and encephalopathy. Experimental hypoxia-ischemia causes a decline in the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin in the immature brain. This decline coincides with the loss of brain function, suggesting this occurrence contributes to neuronal dysfunction and motor impairments.

Germany set up a NAP in 2013 suggesting a three-tiered structure of co-operating centers (CC), centers of excellence (CE) and reference centers (CR). Since then CEs and CRs were organized in the framework of university hospitals. However, realization of CCs taking into account the requirements of the NAP has been slow. We therefore set-up a 12-months program to initiate co-operation and to support the development of structured CCs.MethodsOur center invited 3000 physicians from Berlin and/or Brandenburg to participate. They were chosen either due to already referring patients with rare metabolic diseases to the center, residing in a neighborhood with diverse ethnic background, known to have a high prevalence for specific metabolic diseases, or working as a medical sub-specialist (gastroenterology, hematology, rheumatology) with a high probability to diagnose a rare metabolic disease. The center offered co-operation contracts, administrative and structured medical support, privileged access to the center for physicians and their patients, as well as a program of continuous medical education (CME) over a period of 12 months.ResultsBetween 0.1 to 0.5% (mean 0.2%) of the invited physicians participated in CME meetings. None of them was interested in setting up a co-operating center. The physicians were interested in broadening their knowledge about rare diseases, but less so in direct care for these patients and not at all in fulfilling the requirements of the NAP.ConclusionsThe requirements of the NAP for CC are thought of as unrealistic due to their demands on structural re-organization, quality measurements and additional work-load for outpatient-care. Especially so, with respect for the low number of patients profiting from these efforts and the lack of re-imbursement. We suggest a reconsideration of the German NAP.Keywords: Rare diseases, National action plan, Co-operation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6598233/,abstract

Firstly, the enzyme has been shown to cause mutagenesis at genomic sequences resembling the target sequence. Secondly, the stringent requirement for a specific motif adjacent to the selected target site can limit the target range of this enzyme. Lastly, the physical size of Cas9 challenges the efficient delivery of genomic engineering tools based on this enzyme as viral particles for potential therapeutic applications. Related and parallel strategies have been employed to address these issues. Taking advantage of the wealth of structural information that is becoming available for CRISPR-Cas effector proteins, Cas9 has been redesigned by mutagenizing key residues contributing to activity and target recognition. The protein has also been shortened and redesigned into component subunits in an attempt to facilitate its efficient delivery. Furthermore, the CRISPR-Cas toolbox has been expanded by exploring the properties of Cas9 orthologues and other related effector proteins from diverse bacterial species, some of which exhibit different target site specificities and reduced molecular size.

It remains unclear if sodium picosulphate with magnesium citrate (SPMC), which is considered a tolerable bowel preparation agent, is also an effective alternative for polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium phosphate (NaP).AimThe aim of this article is to compare effectiveness of SPMC to PEG and NaP through assessment of quality of bowel cleansing measured by validated tools.MethodsWe searched electronic databases up to January 2015. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Two authors independently performed selection of studies, risk of bias assessment and data extraction.ResultsThirteen RCTs were included, with overall good quality, but large heterogeneity. SPMC had slightly better quality of bowel cleansing than PEG (pooled RR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11). In most trials SPMC was significantly better tolerated than PEG. There were no significant differences in effectiveness or tolerability between SPMC and NaP. Side effects were similar between agents, except for dizziness (pooled RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.21 in favour of PEG vs. SPMC) and vomiting (pooled RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.95 in favour of single-dose SPMC vs. split-dose).ConclusionsSPMC is equally effective to NaP and little superior to PEG in terms of bowel cleansing.

1533,10.1093/advances/nmy027,30060014,"Go to:AbstractProteins are polymers of amino acids linked via α-peptide bonds. They can be represented as primary, secondary, tertiary, and even quaternary structures, but from a nutritional viewpoint only the primary (amino acid) sequence is of interest. Similarly, although there are many compounds in the body that can be chemically defined as amino acids, we are only concerned with the 20 canonical amino acids encoded in DNA, plus 5 others—ornithine, citrulline, γ-aminobutyrate, β-alanine, and taurine—that play quantitatively important roles in the body. We consume proteins, which are digested in the gastrointestinal tract, absorbed as small peptides (di- and tripeptides) and free amino acids, and then used for the resynthesis of proteins in our cells. Additionally, some amino acids are also used for the synthesis of specific (nonprotein) products, such as nitric oxide, polyamines, creatine, glutathione, nucleotides, glucosamine, hormones, neurotransmitters, and other factors. Again, such functions are not quantitatively important for most amino acids, and the bulk of amino acid metabolism is directly related to protein turnover (synthesis and degradation). For an individual in nitrogen balance, an amount of protein equal to that of the daily protein (nitrogen) intake is degraded each day with the nitrogen being excreted as urea and ammonia (with limited amounts of creatinine and uric acid). The carbon skeletons of the amino acids degraded to urea and ammonia are recovered through gluconeogenesis or ketone synthesis, or oxidized to carbon dioxide. Of the 20 amino acids present in proteins, 9 are considered nutritionally indispensable (essential) in adult humans because the body is not able to synthesize their carbon skeletons. These 9 amino acids are leucine, valine, isoleucine, histidine, lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. In addition, 2 others are made from their indispensable precursors: cysteine from methionine, and tyrosine from phenylalanine. Although arginine is needed in neonates, it appears that adults, with the possible exceptions of pregnancy in females and spermatogenesis in males, can synthesize sufficient arginine to maintain a nitrogen balance. The others, glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, asparagine, serine, glycine, proline, and alanine, can all be synthesized from glucose and a suitable nitrogen source. Under some conditions, glutamine, glutamate, glycine, proline, and arginine may be considered as conditionally indispensable, meaning that the body is not capable of synthesizing them in sufficient quantities for a specific physiologic or pathologic condition (1). Thus, any discussion of dietary protein must consider not only quantity but also quality (ratio of indispensable amino acids).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6140426/,abstract

Our data demonstrate the inducibility of multiple transgenes and the importance of promoter and regulatory elements within the GS system. Mice injected with AAV5 containing the GS system transiently expressed mRNA and protein after MFP induction. The inducer MFP could be measured in plasma and liver tissue, and assessment of MFP and its metabolites showed rapid clearance from murine plasma. In a head-to-head comparison, our single vector outclassed the classical two-vector GS system. Finally, we show repeated inducibility of the transgene that also translated into a dynamic phenotypic change in mice.

Much less progress has been made in identifying inherited variants, even though the disorder itself is familial in the majority of cases. The objective of this study was to identify chromosomal regions that harbor inherited variants increasing the risk for ASD using an approach that examined both ASD and the broad autism phenotype (BAP) among a unique sample of extended pedigrees.MethodsASD and BAP were assessed using standardized tools in 28 pedigrees from Canada and the USA, each with at least three ASD-diagnosed individuals from two nuclear families. Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed using the posterior probability of linkage (PPL) statistic, a quasi-Bayesian method that provides strength of evidence for or against linkage in an essentially model-free manner, with outcomes on the probability scale.ResultsThe results confirm appreciable interfamilial heterogeneity as well as a high level of intrafamilial heterogeneity.

However, an estimated 300,000 people living in the United States today have CCM, of which its majority is undiagnosed. We present a case of CCM acquired in an endemic area and detected in its early stage. A 42-year-old El Salvadoran woman presented with recurrent chest pain and syncopal episodes. Significant family history includes a sister in El Salvador who also began suffering similar episodes. Physical exam and ancillary studies were only remarkable for sinus bradycardia. The patient was diagnosed with symptomatic sinus bradycardia and a pacemaker was placed. During her hospital course, Chagas serology was ordered given the epidemiological context from which she came. With no other identifiable cause, CCM was the suspected etiology. This case highlights the underrecognized presence of Chagas in the United States and the economic and public health importance of its consideration in the etiological differential diagnosis of electrocardiographic changes among Latin American immigrants. While the United States is not considered an endemic area for Chagas disease, the influx of Latin American immigrants has created a new challenge to identify at-risk populations, diagnose suspected cases, and provide adequate treatment for this disease.

The screening method has undergone a continuous development with not only improvements of the positive predictive value but also identification of milder forms of the disease. With the introduction of genetic testing the confirmation of the diagnosis has improved. The Swedish NBS is centralized to one laboratory, which also performs confirmatory testing.Here we present the results of NBS for PKU in Sweden during 1965–2014 describing an increase in diagnosed patients and a shift in the spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) mutations towards an increasing heterogeneity. Milder mutations common in southern Europe and the Middle East together with lowering of the recall level for phenylalanine (Phe) have led to a shift towards milder phenotypes among the patients identified by the screening program. The inclusion of a Phe and tyrosine (Tyr) ratio as an additional marker has improved the positive predictive value to the present 0.92. Also discussed is what impact earlier sampling has had on the prediction of disease severity, concluding that the shift of age at sampling from 72 to 48 h does not increase the risk of missing patients in need of treatment.

This area has recently attracted a surge of interest in psychiatry because studies have reported the pathological activation of the habenula in patients with major depression and in animal models. The LHb plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of depression; however, how habenular neurons are activated to cause various depression symptoms, such as reduced motivation and sleep disturbance, remain unclear. We hypothesized that dysfunctional astrocytes may cause LHb hyperactivity due to the defective uptake activity of extracellular glutamate, which induces depressive-like behaviors. We examined the activity of neurons in habenular pathways and performed behavioral and sleep analyses in mice with pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the activity of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 in the LHb. The habenula-specific inhibition of GLT-1 increased the neuronal firing rate and the level of c-Fos expression in the LHb. Mice with reduced GLT-1 activity in the habenula exhibited a depressive-like phenotype in the tail suspension and novelty-suppressed feeding tests. These animals also displayed increased susceptibility to chronic stress, displaying more frequent avoidant behavior without affecting locomotor activity in the open-field test. Intriguingly, the mice showed disinhibition of rapid eye movement sleep, which is a characteristic sleep pattern in patients with depression. These results provide evidence that disrupting glutamate clearance in habenular astrocytes increases neuronal excitability and depressive-like phenotypes in behaviors and sleep.Keywords: astrocytes, depression, glutamate transporters, habenula, monoamines, rapid eye movement sleep",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6608483/,abstract

This paper (first of the two part series) provides an in-depth understanding of the epidemiological aspects of epilepsy in India for developing effective public health prevention and control programs. The overall prevalence (3.0-11.9 per 1,000 population) and incidence (0.2-0.6 per 1,000 population per year) data from recent studies in India on general population are comparable to the rates of high-income countries (HICs) despite marked variations in population characteristics and study methodologies. There is a differential distribution of epilepsy among various sociodemographic and economic groups with higher rates reported for the male gender, rural population, and low socioeconomic status. A changing pattern in the age-specific occurrence of epilepsy with preponderance towards the older age group is noticed due to sociodemographic and epidemiological transition. Neuroinfections, neurocysticercosis (NCC), and neurotrauma along with birth injuries have emerged as major risk factors for secondary epilepsy. Despite its varied etiology (unknown and known), majority of the epilepsy are manageable in nature. This paper emphasizes the need for focused and targeted programs based on a life-course perspective and calls for a stronger public health approach based on equity for prevention, control, and management of epilepsy in India.Keywords: Aetiology, control, epilepsy, epidemiology, etiology, gender, incidence, prevalence prevention, risk factors, urban-rural differentials",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4564458/,abstract
1552,10.7717/peerj.4561,29637020,"Go to:AbstractBackgroundThe diagnosis of congenital heart defects is challenging, especially for what concerns conotruncal anomalies. Indeed, although the screening techniques of fetal cardiac anomalies have greatly improved, the detection rate of conotruncal anomalies still remains low due to the fact that they are associated with a normal four-chamber view. Therefore, the study aimed to compare real-time three-dimensional echocardiography with live xPlane imaging with two-dimensional (2D) traditional imaging in visualizing ductal and aortic arches during routine echocardiography of the second trimester of gestation.MethodsThis was an observational prospective study including 114 women with uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies. All sonographic studies were performed by two different operators, of them 60 by a first level operator, while 54 by a second level operator. A subanalysis was run in order to evaluate the feasibility and the time needed for the two procedures according to fetal spine position and operator’s experience.ResultsThe measurements with 2D ultrasound were performed in all 114 echocardiographies, while live xPlane imaging was feasible in the 78% of the cases, and this was mainly due to fetal position. The time lapse needed to visualize aortic and ductal arches was significantly lower when using 2D ultrasound compared to live xPlane imaging (29.56 ± 28.5 s vs. 42.5 ± 38.1 s, P = 0.006 for aortic arch; 22.14 ± 17.8 s vs. 37.1 ± 33.8 s, P = 0.001 for ductal arch), also when performing a subanalysis according to operators’ experience (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Feasibility of live xPlane proved to be correlated with the position of the fetal spine and the operator’s experience.DiscussionTo find a reproducible and standardized method to detect fetal heart defects may bring a great benefit for both patients and operators. In this scenario live xPlane imaging is a novel method to visualize ductal and aortic arches. We found that the position of the fetal spine may affect the feasibility of the method since, when the fetal back is anterior or transverse, the visualization of the correct view of three-vessels and trachea in order to set the reference line properly becomes more challenging. In addition, the fetal spine position influences the duration of the ultrasound examination. Regarding operator’s skills and experience, in our study a first level operator was able to perform the complete 2D and xPlane examination in a lower number of cases compared to second level operators. In addition, the time required for the complete examination was higher for first level operators. This means that this technique is based on an adequate operators’ expertise.Keywords: Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography, Congenital heart disease, Matrix probe, Second trimester screening, Prenatal diagnosis, Conotruncal anomalies",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5890721/,abstract

The incidence of various PAH variations differs by race and ethnicity. The aim of the present study was to characterize the PAH gene variants of a Han population from Northern China.MethodsIn total, 655 PKU patients and their families were recruited for this study; each proband was diagnosed both clinically and biochemically with phenylketonuria. Subjects were sequentially screened for single-base variants and exon deletions or duplications within PAH via direct Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).ResultsA spectrum of 174 distinct PAH variants was identified: 152 previously documented variants and 22 novel variants. While single-base variants were distributed throughout the 13 exons, they were particularly concentrated in exons 7 (33.3%), 11 (14.2%), 6 (13.2%), 12 (11.0%), 3 (10.4%), and 5 (4.4%).

To ensure efficient coordination of care, the state EHDI programs rely heavily on audiologists’ prompt reporting of a newborn’s hearing status. Several states have regulations requiring mandatory reporting of a newborn’s hearing status. This is an important public health responsibility of pediatric audiologists. Reasons for failing to report vary.DesignThe Early Hearing Detection and Intervention-Pediatric Audiology Links to Services (EHDI) facility survey was used to inform reporting compliance of audiology facilities throughout the United States. The survey was disseminated via articles, newsletters, and call-to-action notices to audiologists.ResultsAmong 1024 facilities surveyed, 88 (8.6%) reported that they did not report newborn’s hearing findings to their state EHDI program. Not knowing how to report to the state EHDI program was the most frequently chosen reason (60%). However, among the 936 facilities that were compliant with the reporting requirements, 51 estimated that they reported less than two-third of all hearing evaluation results (5.4%). Some facilities did not report a normal-hearing result and some failed to report because they assumed another facility would report the hearing results.ConclusionsSurvey results indicated that audiologists were compliant reporting hearing results to the state EHDI programs. However, there is room for improvement. Regular provider outreach and training by the state EHDI program is necessary to ensure those who are not reporting will comply and to clarify reporting requirements for those who are already compliant.Keywords: Audiology facilities, Early Hearing Detection and Intervention, Guidance, Reporting results, State EHDI programs, Survey",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5570651/,abstract

Compared to dried blood spot samples analyzed by accurate stable isotope dilution assays (SIDAs), the new technique could provide further substantial miniaturizing of folate assays by eliminating hematocrit effects and uneven analyte distribution within the sample. Herein, we present a miniaturized SIDA coupled with LC-MS/MS measurement of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid as main folate vitamer in whole blood (WB) using [13C5]-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid as internal standard. Elution and extraction of only 10.8 μL-dried WB were carried out by centrifugation followed by enzymatic treatment for polyglutamate deconjugation. Matrix separation was achieved by heating and centrifugation. To verify applicability, WB folate status of 11 volunteers was screened. Limits of detection and limits of quantitation were 9 and 26 nmol·L−1, respectively, which is sufficiently low for screening folate status. Recoveries were 97 (±5.8), 99 (±2.8), and 96 (±6.1)% for 800, 400, and 200 nmol L−1 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, respectively. Precision of the LC-MS/MS instrument and inter-assay precision trials revealed CVs of 8.1 and 3.5% (294 nmol L−1), respectively, thus confirming reproducible and precise quantitation. Compared to fresh WB, no significant degradation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was observed after 2.5 h of drying at room temperature. VAMS 5-CH3-H4folate was stable for at least 3 weeks at −20°C. In our pilot study, accurate and diagnostically conclusive determination of folate status was verified. Nevertheless, blood sampling should be performed by trained individuals to avoid substantial errors concerning the absorbed volume. Endogenous folate in rat serum and chicken pancreas caused a significant background especially at low blood 5-CH3-H4folate levels and, thus, for polyglutamate deconjugation, these background folates or alternative mixtures need to be removed. The superior feasibility of a minimized blood collection with VAMS allows further progress regarding time- and cost-effective methodologies in newborn or population screenings for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate status.

In two consecutive years, the total public expenditures on OMPs were calculated by using annual EUR exchange rates. Annual total public expenditures were calculated per capita, and as a proportion of GDP, total public pharmaceutical and healthcare budgets. Differences between countries were compared by calculating the deviations from the average spending of countries.ResultsIn 2015 29.4–92.8% of the 83 OMPs were available with any kind of public reimbursement in participant countries including special reimbursement on an individual basis. In Austria, Belgium and France more OMPs were accessible for patients with public reimbursement than in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Standard reimbursement through retail pharmacies and/or hospitals was applied from 0 to 41% of OMPs. The average annual total public expenditure ranged between 1.4–23.5 €/capita in 2013 and 2014. Higher income countries spent more OMPs in absolute terms. Participant countries spent 0.018–0.066% of their GDPs on funding OMPs. Average expenditures on OMPs were ranged between 2.25–6.51% of the public pharmaceutical budget, and 0.44–0.96% of public healthcare expenditures.ConclusionsStandard and special reimbursement techniques play different roles in participant countries. The number of accessible OMPs indicated an equity gap between Eastern and Western Europe. The spending on OMPs as a proportion of GDP, public pharmaceutical and healthcare expenditure was not higher in lower income countries, which indicates substantial differences in patient access to OMPs in favour of higher-income countries.

Although early introduction of a Phe-restricted diet can prevent severe symptoms from developing, patients who are diagnosed and treated early still experience deficits in cognitive functioning indicating shortcomings of current treatment. In the search for new and/or additional treatment strategies, a specific nutrient combination (SNC) was postulated to improve brain function in PKU. In this study, a long-term dietary intervention with a low-Phe diet, a specific combination of nutrients designed to improve brain function, or both concepts together was investigated in male and female BTBR PKU and WT mice.Material & methods48 homozygous wild-types (WT, +/+) and 96 PKU BTBRPah2 (-/-) male and female mice received dietary interventions from postnatal day 31 till 10 months of age and were distributed in the following six groups: high Phe diet (WT C-HP, PKU C-HP), high Phe plus specific nutrient combination (WT SNC-HP, PKU SNC-HP), PKU low-Phe diet (PKU C-LP), and PKU low-Phe diet plus specific nutrient combination (PKU SNC- LP). Memory and motor function were tested at time points 3, 6, and 9 months after treatment initiation in the open field (OF), novel object recognition test (NOR), spatial object recognition test (SOR), and the balance beam (BB). At the end of the experiments, brain neurotransmitter concentrations were determined.ResultsIn the NOR, we found that PKU mice, despite being subjected to high Phe conditions, could master the task on all three time points when supplemented with SNC. Under low Phe conditions, PKU mice on control diet could master the NOR at all three time points, while PKU mice on the SNC supplemented diet could master the task at time points 6 and 9 months. SNC supplementation did not consistently influence the performance in the OF, SOR or BB in PKU mice. The low Phe diet was able to normalize concentrations of norepinephrine and serotonin; however, these neurotransmitters were not influenced by SNC supplementation.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that both a long-lasting low Phe diet, the diet enriched with SNC, as well as the combined diet was able to ameliorate some, but not all of these PKU-induced abnormalities. Specifically, this study is the first long-term intervention study in BTBR PKU mice that shows that SNC supplementation can specifically improve novel object recognition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6420157/,abstract

Two months later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that the current available evidence supports the existence of a causal relationship between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. Microcephaly can be caused by several factors, and its clinical course and prognosis are difficult to predict. Other pathogens with proven teratogenicity have been identified long before the current ZIKV epidemic. Despite the growing number of cases with maternal signs of infection and/or presence of ZIKV in tissues of affected newborns or fetuses, it is currently difficult to assess the magnitude of increase of microcephaly prevalence in Brazil, as well as the role of other factors in the development of congenital neurological conditions. Meanwhile, health agencies and medical organizations have issued cautious guidelines advising health care practitioners and expectant couples traveling to, returning from, or living in affected areas. Analogous to dengue virus (DENV) epidemics, ZIKV has the potential to become endemic in all countries infested by Aedes mosquitoes, while new mutations could impact viral replication in humans, leading to increased virulence and consequently heightened chances of viral transmission to additional naive mosquito vectors.

We used a multiplatform metabolomics approach to evaluate the metabolic signature associated with Phe and Tyr.Material and methods: We prospectively included 10 PKU adult patients and matched controls. We analysed the metabolome profile using GC-MS (urine), amino-acid analyzer (urine and plasma) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (urine). We performed a multivariate analysis from the metabolome (after exclusion of Phe, Tyr and directly derived metabolites) to explain plasma Phe and Tyr concentrations, and the clinical status. Finally, we performed a univariate analysis of the most discriminant metabolites and we identified the associated metabolic pathways.Results: We obtained a metabolic pattern from 118 metabolites and we built excellent multivariate models to explain Phe, Tyr concentrations and PKU diagnosis. Common metabolites of these models were identified: Gln, Arg, succinate and alpha aminobutyric acid. Univariate analysis showed an inverse correlation between Arg, alpha aminobutyric acid and Phe and a positive correlation between Arg, succinate, Gln and Tyr (p < 0.0003). Thus, we highlighted the following pathways: Arg and Pro, Ala, Asp and Glu metabolism.Discussion: We obtain a specific metabolic signature related to Tyr and Phe concentrations. We confirmed the involvement of different pathophysiological mechanisms previously described in PKU such as protein synthesis, energetic metabolism and oxidative stress.

Definitions of ‘nutraceuticals’ and related terms, still widely used, should therefore be explored systematically. There are no internationally agreed definitions of ‘nutraceuticals’ and ‘functional foods’, or of similar terms, such as ‘health foods’, or of terms related to herbal products, which are sometimes referred to as ‘nutraceuticals’, compounding the confusion. ‘Nutraceuticals’ and ‘functional foods’ are vague, nondiscriminatory, unhelpful terms; the evidence suggests that they should be abandoned in favour of more precise terms. The term ‘dietary supplement’ is widely used to designate formulations that are also called ‘nutraceuticals’ but it would be better restricted to individual compounds used to treat or prevent deficiencies. ‘Fortified foods’, sometimes called ‘designer foods’, are foods to which compounds of proven therapeutic or preventive efficacy (e.g. folic acid) have been added.

Around 200 of IEMs are potentially treatable through diet, pharmacological and other therapies, if diagnosed earlier in life. IEMs can be diagnosed early through newborn screening (NBS) programs, which are in place in most of the developed countries. However, establishing a NBS in a developing country is a challenging task due to scarcity of disease related data, large population size, poor economy, and burden of other common disorders. Since, not enough data is available for the prevalence of IEMs in Pakistan; therefore, in this study, we set out to find the prevalence of various treatable IEMs in a cohort of intellectually disabled patients suspected for IEMs, which will help us to initiate a NBS program for the most frequent IEMs in Pakistan. Therefore, a total of 429 intellectually disabled (IQ <70) patient samples were collected from Pakistan. A subset of 113 patient samples was selected based on the clinical information for the detailed biochemical screening. Advance analytical techniques like, Amino Acid Analyzer, GC-MS, UHPLC-MS, and MS/MS were used to screen for different treatable IEMs like aminoacidopathies, fatty acid β-oxidation disorders and mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) etc. A total of 14 patients were diagnosed with an IEM i.e., 9 with homocystinuria, 2 with MPS, 2 with Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency and 1 with sitosterolemia. These IEMs are found frequent in the collected patient samples from Pakistan. Thus, present study can help to take an initiative step to start a NBS program in Pakistan, especially for the homocystinuria having highest incidence among aminoacidopathies in the studied patients, and which is amenable to treatment. This endeavor will pave the way for a healthier life of affected patients and will lessen the burden on their families and society.Keywords: inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs), intellectual disability, newborn screening (NBS), evidence based medicine (EBM), homocystinuria, Pakistan",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6650569/,abstract

Today, a de novo or inherited genetic abnormality can be identified as pathogenic in one-third of cases. We refer to them here as monogenic causes, insofar as the genetic abnormality has a readily detectable, large effect. What explains the other two-thirds? This review considers a complex genetic basis. That is, a combination of genetic mutations or variants that individually may have little or no detectable effect contribute to the pathogenesis of a heart defect. Genes in the embryo that act directly in cardiac developmental pathways have received the most attention, but genes in the mother that establish the gestational milieu via pathways related to metabolism and aging also have an effect. A growing body of evidence highlights the pathogenic significance of genetic interactions in the embryo and maternal effects that have a genetic basis.

Data were analysed by multilevel logistic regression, with family- and individual-level characteristics at the first level and level of neighbourhood deprivation at the second level.ResultsDuring the study period, among a total of 748,951 children, 1499 (0.2 %) were hospitalised with CHD. Age-adjusted cumulative hospitalisation rates for CHD increased with increasing level of neighbourhood deprivation. In the study population, 1.8 per 1000 and 2.2 per 1000 children in the least and most deprived neighbourhoods, respectively, were hospitalised with CHD. The incidence of hospitalisation for CHD increased with increasing neighbourhood-level deprivation across all family and individual-level socio-demographic categories. The odds ratio (OR) for hospitalisation for CHD for those living in high-deprivation neighbourhoods versus those living in low-deprivation neighbourhoods was 1.23 (95 % confidence interval (CI)=1.04–1.46). In the full model, which took account for age, paternal and maternal individual-level socio-economic characteristics, comorbidities (e.g. maternal type 2 diabetes, OR=3.03; maternal hypertension, OR=2.01), and family history of CHD (OR=3.27), the odds of CHD were slightly attenuated but did not remain significant in the most deprived neighbourhoods (OR=1.20, 95 % CI=0.99–1.45, p=0.057).ConclusionsThis study is the largest so far on neighbourhood influences on CHD, and the results suggest that deprived neighbourhoods have higher rates of CHD, which represents important clinical knowledge.

Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment through newborn screening has gradually shifted treatment goals from the prevention of disabling complications to the optimization of long term outcomes. However, clinical evidence demonstrates that subtle suboptimal neurocognitive outcomes are present in the early and continuously diet-treated population with PAH deficiency. This may be attributed to variation in blood phenylalanine levels to outside treatment range and this, in turn, is possibly due to a combination of factors; disease severity, dietary noncompliance and differences in practice related to the management of PAH deficiency. One of CIMDRN’s goals is to understand current practices in the diagnosis and management of PAH deficiency in the pediatric population, from the perspective of both health care providers and patients/families.ObjectivesWe investigated Canadian metabolic dietitians’ perspectives on the nutritional management of children with PAH deficiency, awareness of recently published North American treatment and nutritional guidelines in relation to PAH deficiency, and nutritional care practices within and outside these guidelines.MethodsWe invited 33 dietitians to participate in a survey, to ascertain their use of recently published guidelines and their practices in relation to the nutritional care of pediatric patients with PAH deficiency.ResultsWe received 19 responses (59% response rate). All participants reported awareness of published guidelines for managing PAH deficiency. To classify disease severity, 89% of dietitians reported using pre-treatment blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels, alone or in combination with other factors. 74% of dietitians reported using blood Phe levels ≥360 μmol/L (6 mg/dL) as the criterion for initiating a Phe-restricted diet. All respondents considered 120-360 μmol/L (2–6 mg/dL) as the optimal treatment range for blood Phe in children 0–9 years old, but there was less agreement on blood Phe targets for older children. Most dietitians reported similar approaches to diet assessment and counseling: monitoring growth trends, use of 3 day diet records for intake analysis, individualization of diet goals, counseling patients to count grams of dietary natural protein or milligrams of dietary Phe, and monitoring blood Phe, tyrosine and ferritin.ConclusionWhile Canadian dietitians’ practices in managing pediatric PAH deficiency are generally aligned with those of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), and with the associated treatment and nutritional guidelines from Genetic Metabolic Dietitians International (GMDI), variation in many aspects of care reflects ongoing uncertainty and a need for robust evidence.Keywords: PAH deficiency, Phenylketonuria, PKU, Management practices, Nutrition management, PAH deficiency practice guidelines, Metabolic dietitians’ survey",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6323774/,abstract

This challenge has been recognized by all stakeholders who endorse the need for flexibility in the regulatory review process for novel therapeutics to treat rare diseases. In the United States, the best expression of this flexibility was the creation of the Accelerated Approval (AA) pathway. The AA pathway is critically important for the development of treatments for diseases with high unmet medical need and has been used extensively for drugs used to treat cancer and infectious diseases like HIV.In 2012, the AA provisions were amended to enhance the application of the AA pathway to expedite the development of drugs for rare disorders under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA). FDASIA, among many provisions, requires the development of a more relevant FDA guidance on the types of evidence that may be acceptable in support of using a novel surrogate endpoint. The application of AA to rare diseases requires more predictability to drive greater access to appropriate use of AA for more rare disease treatments that might not be developed otherwise.This white paper proposes a scientific framework for assessing biomarker endpoints to enhance the development of novel therapeutics for rare and devastating diseases currently without adequate treatment and is based on the opinions of experts in drug development and rare disease patient groups. Specific recommendations include: 1) Establishing regulatory rationale for increased AA access in rare disease programs; 2) Implementing a Biomarker Qualification Request Process to provide the opportunity for an early determination of biomarker acceptance; and 3) A proposed scientific framework for qualifying biomarkers as primary endpoints.

However, priming of OCp away from bone, such as in inflammatory tissues, as revealed in peripheral blood, may represent a second pathway, particularly relevant in individuals who suffer from systemic bone loss such as prevalent in inflammatory diseases. In this review, we used a systematic approach to review the literature on osteoclast formation in peripheral blood in patients with inflammatory diseases associated with bone loss. Only studies that compared inflammatory (bone) disease with healthy controls in the same study were included. Using this core collection, it becomes clear that experimental osteoclastogenesis using peripheral blood from patients with bone loss diseases in prevalent diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, periodontitis, and cancer-related osteopenia unequivocally point toward an intrinsically increased osteoclast formation and activation. In particular, such increased osteoclastogenesis already takes place without the addition of the classical osteoclastogenesis cytokines M-CSF and RANKL in vitro. We show that T-cells and monocytes as OCp are the minimal demands for such unstimulated osteoclast formation. In search for common and disease-specific denominators of the diseases with inflammation-driven bone loss, we demonstrate that altered T-cell activity and a different composition—such as the CD14+CD16+ vs. CD14+CD16– monocytes—and priming of OCp with increased M-CSF, RANKL, and TNF- α levels in peripheral blood play a role in increased osteoclast formation and activity.

Notwithstanding the cost, many countries have started to adopt this novel technology, including resource-limited Southeast Asia (SEA) countries. This study aimed to describe the status of PM adoption in SEA, highlight the challenges and to propose strategies for future development.MethodsThe study included scoping review and key stakeholder interviews in four focus countries – Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. The current landscape of PM adoption was evaluated based on an assessment framework of six key themes – healthcare system, governance, access, awareness, implementation, and data. Six PM programs were evaluated for their financing and implementation mechanisms.ResultsThe findings revealed SEA has progressed in adopting PM especially Singapore and Thailand. A regional pharmacogenomics research network has been established. However, PM policies and programs vary significantly. As most PM programs are champion-driven and the available funding is limited, the current PM distribution has the potential to widen existing health disparities. Low PM awareness in the society and the absence of political support with financial investment are fundamental barriers. There is a clear need to broaden opportunities for critical discourse about PM especially for policymakers. Multi-stakeholder, multi-country strategies need to be prioritized in order to leverage resources and expertise.ConclusionsAdopting PM remains in its infancy in SEA.

We hypothesized that supplementation with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH
4) would recouple endothelial nitric oxide synthase and thus improve endothelial function and consequently reduce aortic stiffness.Methods and ResultsWe conducted 2 randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled crossover studies examining 2 separate regimens: an acute regimen, with a single dose of BH
4 400 mg versus placebo (n=18), and a short‐term regimen, composed of a 1‐week treatment with BH
4 400 mg once daily versus placebo (n=15). Flow‐mediated dilatation and aortic pulse wave velocity were studied 4 times, before and after each treatment phase. Acute BH
4 supplementation led to an improvement of flow‐mediated dilatation, whereas placebo had no effect (mean±SD of effect difference 2.56±4.79%; P=0.03). Similarly, 1‐week treatment with BH
4 improved endothelial function, but there was no change with placebo (mean±SD of effect difference 3.50±5.05%; P=0.02). There was no change in aortic pulse wave velocity following acute or short‐term BH
4 supplementation or placebo (mean±SD of effect difference: acute 0.09±0.67 m/s, P=0.6; short‐term 0.03±1.46 m/s, P=0.9).ConclusionBoth acute and short‐term supplementation with oral BH
4 improved endothelial function but not aortic stiffness. This result suggests that BH
4 supplementation may be beneficial for patients with rheumatoid arthritis by improving endothelial dysfunction and potentially reducing risk of cardiovascular disease.

However, the extent of the communication process and provision of information to patients about pharmacogenetics is unclear. Pharmacogenetic information may be included in sections of a drug’s package insert intended for patients, which is provided directly to patients or communicated via the health provider. To determine what pharmacogenetic information, if any, is included in patient-targeted sections of the drug label, we reviewed the labels listed in the US Food and Drug Administration’s Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labels. To date, 140 drugs include pharmacogenetic-related information in the approved label. Our analysis revealed that pharmacogenetic information is included in patient-targeted sections for a minority (n=29; 21%) of drug labels, with no obvious pattern associated with the inclusion of pharmacogenetic information.

The limited accessibility of bile duct precludes modeling of several cholangiocyte-mediated diseases. Therefore, novel approaches for obtaining functional cholangiocytes with high purity are needed. Previous work has shown that the combination of Hnf1β and Foxa3 could directly convert mouse fibroblasts into bipotential hepatic stem cell-like cells, termed iHepSCs. However, the efficiency of converting fibroblasts into iHepSCs is low, and these iHepSCs exhibit extremely low differentiation potential into cholangiocytes, thus hindering the translation of iHepSCs to the clinic. Here, we describe that the expression of Hnf1α and Foxa3 dramatically facilitates the robust generation of iHepSCs. Notably, prolonged in vitro culture of Hnf1α- and Foxa3-derived iHepSCs induces a Notch signaling-mediated secondary conversion into cholangiocyte progenitor-like cells that display dramatically enhanced differentiation capacity into mature cholangiocytes. Our study provides a robust two-step approach for obtaining cholangiocyte progenitor-like cells using defined factors.Keywords: direct conversion, cholangiocyte progenitor cells, hepatic stem cells, Notch signal",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5995161/,abstract

In our previous review, we described brain cholesterol metabolism in control
conditions and in the case of some rare neurological pathologies linked to
defects in the genes which are directly involved in the synthesis and/or
traffic of cholesterol. Here, we have analyzed disruptions in cholesterol
homeostasis in widespread neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s diseases) and autism spectrum disorders. We particularly
focused on the synaptic dysfunctions that could arise from changes in both
membrane cholesterol availability and oxysterol production. Notably,
alterations in the brain cholesterol metabolism and neurotransmission occur in
the early stages of these pathologies and the polymorphism of the genes
associated with cholesterol homeostasis and synaptic communication affects the
risk of onset and severity of these diseases. In addition, pharmacological and
genetic manipulations of brain cholesterol homeostasis in animal models
frequently have marked effects on the progression of neurodegenerative
diseases. Thus, the development of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and
autism spectrum disorders may be partially associated with an imbalance of
cholesterol homeostasis that leads to changes in the membrane cholesterol and
oxysterol levels that, in turn, modulates key steps in the synaptic
transmission.

We present sample characteristics and the utility of an online eating disorder diagnostic questionnaire suitable for large-scale genetic and population research.Methods:ANGI recruited from the United States (US), Australia/New Zealand (ANZ), Sweden (SE), and Denmark (DK). Recruitment was via national registers (SE, DK); treatment centers (US, ANZ, SE, DK); and social and traditional media (US, ANZ, SE). All cases had a lifetime AN diagnosis based on DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria (excluding amenorrhea). Recruited controls had no lifetime history of disordered eating behaviors. To assess the positive and negative predictive validity of the online eating disorder questionnaire (ED100K-v1), 109 women also completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), Module H.Results:Blood samples and clinical information were collected from 13,364 individuals with lifetime AN and from controls. Online diagnostic phenotyping was effective and efficient; the validity of the questionnaire was acceptable.Conclusions:Our multi-pronged recruitment approach was highly effective for rapid recruitment and can be used as a model for efforts by other groups.

Higher mean entropy values and lower mean tone values when stressed showed a reduction in randomness with increased sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic activity. A ROC analysis was used to estimate the diagnostic performances of tone and entropy and combining both features. Comparing the resting and simulation phase separately, the performance of tone outperformed entropy, but combining the two in a quadratic linear regression model, neonates in resting as compared to stress phases could be distinguished with high accuracy.

We hypothesized that the thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (NIS) gene could be used to visualize transplanted hepatocytes in a rodent model of inherited liver disease, hereditary tyrosinemia type 1. Wildtype C57Bl/6J mouse hepatocytes were transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector containing the mouse Slc5a5 (NIS) gene under the control of the thyroxine-binding globulin promoter. NIS-labeled cells could robustly concentrate radiolabeled iodine in vitro, with lentiviral transduction efficiencies greater than 80% achieved in the presence of dexamethasone. Next, NIS-labeled hepatocytes were transplanted into congenic fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase knockout (Fah−/−) mice, resulting in prevention of liver failure. NIS-labeled hepatocytes were readily imaged in vivo by single-photon emission computed tomography, demonstrating for the first time noninvasive 3D imaging of regenerating tissue in individual animals over time using clinically relevant methodology. We also tested the efficacy of primary hepatocyte spheroids to engraft in the liver. Using the NIS-reporter, robust spheroid engraftment and survival could be detected longitudinally after direct parenchymal injection, thereby demonstrating a novel strategy for hepatocyte transplantation.ConclusionThis work is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of NIS-imaging in the field of liver regeneration.

This study attempted to identify potential biomarkers by detecting changes in the levels of plasma proteins in T2DM patients following onset of AMI in comparison with those without AMI. Volunteer T2DM patients without AMI (control; n=10) and T2DM patients with AMI (n=10) were recruited. Plasma samples from these patients were evaluated via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) to screen for proteins with level changes between the two groups. The abundance of spots on gel images was analyzed using Progenesis SameSpots and subjected to false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. Protein spots with statistically significant changes of at least 1.5 fold were selected for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Due to strong cardiac connections, tetranectin and titin were evaluated by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The adjusted P-values and fold changes between the two groups resulted in identification of 34 protein spots with significantly altered abundance. Upon MS analysis, 17 plasma proteins were identified: tetranectin, titin, clusterin, haptoglobin, myosin-13, zinc fnger protein 445, DNA repair protein RAD50, serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-IV, caspase-6, aminoacyl tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1, serotransferrin, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A-I and serum amyloid A. Comparable patterns of changes in tetranectin and titin between the control and AMI groups were confirmed using ELISA. In summary, tetranectin and titin in plasma appeared to be closely associated with the onset of AMI among T2DM patients and can be used as potential biomarkers for prediction of a cardiac event, though this requires validation in a prospective cohort study.Keywords: tetranectin, titin, acute myocardial infarction, coronary disease, diabetes mellitus, proteomics, 2D gel electrophoresis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6289394/,abstract

this method, a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized silver colloidal
(AgC) solution was first prepared and mixed with a sample solution.
Following deposition of the mixture solution on a solid substrate
with a rough surface, a coffee ring was formed once the solvent had
evaporated. The formation of a coffee ring not only concentrated the
analyte but also reduced the space between silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)
to strengthen the hotspot effect, thereby considerably improving SERS
sensitivity. To strengthen the coffee ring effect further, the surface
roughness of the solid support and PVP content of the AgC solution
were investigated. The results indicated that an increase in surface
roughness reduced the size of the coffee rings, whereas the addition
of PVP not only stabilized the AgNPs but also improved the compactness
of the coffee rings. When applying the proposed method to determine
the phenylalanine (Phe) level in urine for rapid screening of the
phenylketonuria disorder, strong chemical interference from uric acid

What is more, the complexity and diversity provided by the developmental period only adds to this contention. The development of executive function plays an integral part in the expression of children's behavioral, cognitive, social, and emotional capabilities. Understanding how these processes are constructed during development allows for effective measurement of EF in this population. This meta-analysis aims to contribute to a better understanding of the structure of executive function in children. A coordinate-based meta-analysis was conducted (using BrainMap GingerALE 2.3), which incorporated studies administering functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during inhibition, switching, and working memory updating tasks in typical children (aged 6–18 years). The neural activation common across all executive tasks was compared to that shared by tasks pertaining only to inhibition, switching or updating, which are commonly considered to be fundamental executive processes. Results support the existence of partially separable but partially overlapping inhibition, switching, and updating executive processes at a neural level, in children over 6 years. Further, the shared neural activation across all tasks (associated with a proposed “unitary” component of executive function) overlapped to different degrees with the activation associated with each individual executive process. These findings provide evidence to support the suggestion that one of the most influential structural models of executive functioning in adults can also be applied to children of this age. However, the findings also call for careful consideration and measurement of both specific executive processes, and unitary executive function in this population. Furthermore, a need is highlighted for a new systematic developmental model, which captures the integrative nature of executive function in children.Keywords: executive function, fMRI, children, ALE meta-analysis, inhibition, switching, updating, cognitive control",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5383671/,abstract

The exposome provides an excellent scientific framework for studying human health and disease. Recently, it has been suggested that how exposures affect our biology and how our bodies respond to such exposures should be part of the exposome.Objectives: The authors describe the biological impact of the exposome and outline many of the targets and processes that can be assessed as part of a comprehensive analysis of the exposome.Discussion: The processes that occur downstream from the initial interactions with exogenous and endogenous compounds determine the biological impact of exposures. If the effects are not considered in the same context as the exposures, it will be difficult to determine cause and effect. The exposome and biology are interactive—changes in biology due to the environment change one’s vulnerability to subsequent exposures. Additionally, highly resilient individuals are able to withstand environmental exposures with minimal effects to their health. We expect that the vast majority of exposures are transient, and chemicals underlying exposures that occurred weeks, months, or years ago are long gone from the body. However, these past chemical exposures often leave molecular fingerprints that may be able to provide information on these past exposures.Conclusions: Through linking exposures to specific biological responses, exposome research could serve to improve understanding of the mechanistic connections between exposures and health to help mitigate adverse health outcomes across the lifespan.Citation: Dennis KK, Auerbach SS, Balshaw DM, Cui Y, Fallin MD, Smith MT, Spira A, Sumner S, Miller GW. 2016.

Transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma is thought to be a very rare phenomenon in the HNF1A-inactivated variant of HCA. However, we recently observed 2 cases at our institution, 1 definite hepatocellular carcinoma and 1 possible hepatocellular carcinoma, with loss of LFABP staining, raising the possibility that LFABP down-regulation may be associated with hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Our aim was to evaluate hepatocellular carcinomas arising in various backgrounds and with varying degrees of differentiation for loss of LFABP staining. Twenty total cases of hepatocellular carcinoma were examined. Thirteen cases arose in a background of cirrhosis due to hepatitis C (n = 8) or steatohepatitis (n = 5); 7 cases arose in a noncirrhotic background, with 2 cases arising within HNF1A-inactivated variant HCA and 2 cases arising within inflammatory variant HCA. Complete loss of expression of LFABP was seen in 6 of 20 cases, including 2 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma arising within HNF1A-inactivated variant HCA. Thus, loss of staining for LFABP appears to be common in hepatocellular carcinoma and may be seen in well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, LFABP loss should not be interpreted as evidence for hepatocellular adenoma over carcinoma, when other features support a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

We investigated whether these founder mutations are covered in the (preconception) expanded carrier screening tests of five carrier screening providers. Our results show that the great majority of founder mutations are not covered in these screening panels, and these panels may thus not be appropriate for use in founder populations. It is therefore important to be aware of founder mutations in a population when offering carrier tests.Keywords: Founder population, Community, Carrier screening, Autosomal recessive, Netherlands",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5614881/,abstract

In addition, the diagnostic features are discussed.Case Report:The case of a female newborn who died on her third day of life was studied at the Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Chieti-Pescara (Italy). The investigations around her death revealed a cardiac congenital malformation, seen as a rare variant of a common arterial trunk, in which the aorta was fused with the right branch of the pulmonary artery. The ascending aorta showed hypoplasia, while the coronary arteries were free of any pathological findings. The atrial septum showed a closed foramen ovale and the ventricular septum did not show any defect. Only an isolated right ventricular hypertrophy and dilation with no other cardiac abnormalities was found. The cause of death was acute respiratory failure on the third day of extrauterine life when the ductus Botalli closed. The karyotype analysis performed in this case was normal, and the fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis did not show the 22q11.2 microdeletion suggestive of the DiGeorge syndrome.Conclusions:These findings underline the value of 3-dimensional/4-dimensional ultrasound imaging when added to a fetal cardiology screening program, and the need for improvements in postnatal screening routines by using pulse oximetry in order to discover isolated vascular defects before circulatory collapse occurs, as well as to reduce the medico-legal disputes in cases of missed diagnosis.

With colonization came an increasing dependence on imported processed foods. This dietary change has often been reported to be one of the factors leading to Indigenous health and wellbeing disparities worldwide. We determined the amino acid (AA) profile including tryptophan (Trp) of wild meats (game and fish) and processed meats found in the traditional and modern diets of Indigenous subarctic communities in Canada. Trp is a limited essential AA necessary for synthesis of serotonin (5-HT), an important neurotransmitter and homeostatic regulator. The dietary ratio of Trp relative to other large neutral AAs (LNAA) can alter Trp transport and 5-HT synthesis in the brain. We determined AA composition of wild meats and processed meats using standardized NaOH and HCl hydrolysis for Trp and other AAs, respectively, followed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography. A Principal Components Analysis revealed that overall AA composition is significantly different between wild and processed meats. (M)ANOVA showed significantly higher protein in wild meats (wet weight, ww). Trp was significantly lower in processed meat samples (n=15; 0.18g/100g ± 0.02 ww) compared to wild meat samples (n=25; 0.24g/100g ± 0.06 ww). The proportion of Trp:LNAA and Trp in sample protein were not significantly different between wild (1:21-1:27, 0.92-1.27 g/100g protein) and processed (1:20-1:24, 1.03-1.27 g/100g protein) meats. Within wild meats, AA composition is significantly different between fish and waterfowl, fish and moose, and moose and goose.

We developed a rapid and simple molecular test for the most frequent phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, Gene ID: 5053) mutations. Using this method to detect the 18 most frequent mutations, it is possible to achieve a 75% detection rate in Italian population. The variants selected also reach a high detection rate in other populations, for example, 70% in southern Germany, 68% in western Germany, 76% in Denmark, 68% in Sweden, 63% in Poland, and 60% in Bulgaria. We successfully applied this confirmation test in neonatal screening for hyperphenylalaninemias using dried blood spots and obtained the genotype in approximately 48 h. The method was found to be suitable as second tier test in neonatal screening for hyperphenylalaninemias in neonates with a positive screening test. This test can also be useful for carrier screening because it can bypass the entire coding sequence and intron–exon boundaries sequencing, thereby overcoming the questions that this approach implies, such as new variant interpretations.Keywords: phenylketonuria, phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, PKU mutation analysis, PKU screening",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6481045/,abstract

A systematic search of five databases was designed to identify relevant published literature. A global overview of 1099 studies highlights the geographic distribution of OR and common OR methods used. From this collection of literature, a narrative description of the use of OR across four main application areas of global health – health systems and operations, clinical medicine, public health and health innovation – is also presented. The theme of health equity is then explored in detail through a subset of 44 studies. Health equity is a critical element of global health that cuts across all four application areas, and is an issue particularly amenable to analysis through OR. Finally, we present seven select cases of OR analyses that have been implemented or have influenced decision-making in global health policy or practice. Based on these cases, we identify three key drivers for success in bridging the gap between OR and global health policy, namely international collaboration with stakeholders, use of contextually appropriate data, and varied communication outlets for research findings. Such cases, however, represent a very small proportion of the literature found.ConclusionPoor availability of representative and quality data, and a lack of collaboration between those who develop OR models and stakeholders in the contexts where OR analyses are intended to serve, were found to be common challenges for effective OR modelling in global health.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12961-017-0187-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Operations research, Modelling, Policy, Decision-making, Global health, Health systems, Health equity, Developing countries, Low-resource settings",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5395767/,abstract

The efficiency of translational readthrough depends on a variety of factors, including the identity of the termination codon, the surrounding mRNA sequence context, and the presence of stimulating compounds.

Review of this newborn screening results showed subtle elevation of citrulline, overlapping the normal range. These findings suggest that newborn screening may be missing other patients with ASL deficiency with at least one hypomorphic allele.

While neuronal computation is known to depend on the morphology of dendrites, their underlying topological blueprint remains unknown. Here, we used a centripetal branch ordering scheme originally developed to describe river networks—the Horton-Strahler order (SO)–to examine hierarchical relationships of branching statistics in reconstructed and model dendritic trees. We report on a number of universal topological relationships with SO that are true for all binary trees and distinguish those from SO-sorted metric measures that appear to be cell type-specific. The latter are therefore potential new candidates for categorising dendritic tree structures. Interestingly, we find a faithful correlation of branch diameters with centripetal branch orders, indicating a possible functional importance of SO for dendritic morphology and growth. Also, simulated local voltage responses to synaptic inputs are strongly correlated with SO. In summary, our study identifies important SO-dependent measures in dendritic morphology that are relevant for neural function while at the same time it describes other relationships that are universal for all dendrites.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515450/,abstract

Efficacy data were obtained from European Public Assessment Reports, relative effectiveness data from the Dutch National Healthcare Institute website, and real-world effectiveness data from literature and interviews with experts and patients. Efficacy and effectiveness were scored as ‘no effect’, ‘unclear’ or ‘good’ based upon a prespecified scoring system.ResultsWe identified 31 authorized OMPs, of which 21 had post-marketing studies available, thus making it possible to score real-world effectiveness.

Indeed, changes in the PKU gut microbiota compared with healthy controls have been previously reported. In this study we compared the gut microbial communities of children with PKU and with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP, unrestricted diet). For each group, we enrolled 21 children (4–18 years old), for a total dataset of 42 subjects. We assessed dietary intake and performed gut microbiota analysis by sequencing the V3–V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were quantified by gas chromatographic analysis. While alpha-diversity analysis showed no significant differences between PKU and MHP groups, microbial community analysis highlighted a significant separation of the gut microbiota according to both unweighted (p = 0.008) and weighted Unifrac distances (p = 0.033). Major differences were seen within the Firmicutes phylum. Indeed, PKU children were depleted in Faecalibacterium spp. and enriched in Blautia spp. and Clostridium spp (family Lachnospiraceae). We found a divergent response of members of the Firmicutes phylum with respect to daily glycemic index, higher in PKU children. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, unclassified Ruminococcaceae and, to a lesser extent Roseburia spp. negatively correlated with glycemic index, whereas unclassified Lachnospiraceae were positively associated. Indicator species analysis suggested F. prausnitzii be related to MHP status and Ruminococcus bromii to be associated with PKU. Despite PKU children having a higher vegetable and fiber intake, resembling a vegan diet, their gut microbial profile is different from the microbiota reported in the literature for individuals consuming a high-fiber/low-protein diet. Indeed, beneficial microorganisms, such as F. prausnitzii, considered a biomarker for a healthy status and one of the main butyrate producers, are depleted in PKU gut microbiota.

Nurses play a critical role in the effort to make patients fully engaged in their disease management. Trainings devoted to increase nurses' skills and knowledge to assess and promote patient engagement are today a medical education priority. To address this goal, we developed a program of nurse education training in patient engagement strategies (NET-PES). This paper presents pilot feasibility study and preliminary participants outcomes for NET-PES.Methods: This is a pilot feasibility study of a 2-session program on patient engagement designed to improve professional nurses' ability to engage chronic patients in their medical journey; the training mainly focused on passing patient engagement assessment skills to clinicians as a crucial mean to improve care experience. A pre-post pilot evaluation of NET-PES included 46 nurses working with chronic conditions. A course specific competence test has been developed and validated to measure patient engagement skills. The design included self-report questionnaire completed before and after the training for evaluation purposes. Participants met in a large group for didactic presentations and then they were split into small groups in which they used role-play and case discussion to reflect upon the value of patient engagement measurement in relation to difficult cases from own practice.Results: Forty-six nurses participated in the training program. The satisfaction questionnaire showed that the program met the educational objectives and was considered to be useful and relevant by the participants. Results demonstrated changes on clinicians' attitudes and skills in promoting engagement. Moreover, practitioners demonstrated increases on confidence regarding their ability to support their patients' engagement in the care process.Conclusions: Learning programs teaching nurses about patient engagement strategies and assessment measures in clinical practice are key in supporting the realization of patient engagement in healthcare. Training nurses in this area is feasible and accepted and might have an impact on their ability to engage patients in the chronic care journey. Due to the limitation of the research design, further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of such a program and to verify if the benefits envisaged in this pilot are maintained on a long-term perspective and to test results by employing a randomized control study design.Keywords: patient engagement, patient engagement measurement, nursing staff, hospital, professional-patient relation, empowerment, educational program, patient activation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5222845/,abstract

To circumvent this potential interpretational problem, we aimed at providing an overview about whether and how dietary supplementation of different complex carbohydrates changes the gut microbiome in healthy non-obese individuals. We then reviewed whether the reported changes in gut bacterial members found to be established by complex carbohydrates would benefit or harm the cardiometabolic and immunological health of the host taking into account the alterations in the microbiome composition and abundance known to be associated with obesity and its associated disorders. By combining these research areas, we aimed to give a better insight into the potential of (foods containing) complex carbohydrates in the treatment and prevention of above-mentioned diseases. We conclude that supplemental complex carbohydrates that increase Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, without increasing the deleterious Bacteroides, are most likely promoting cardiometabolic and immunological health in obese subjects. Because certain complex carbohydrates also affect the host’s immunity directly, it is likely that host–microbiome interactions in determination of health and disease characteristics are indeed bidirectional. Overall, this review article shows that whereas it is relatively clear in which direction supplemental fermentable carbohydrates can alter the gut microbiome, the relevance of these changes regarding health remains controversial. Future research should take into account the different causes of obesity and its adverse health conditions, which in turn have drastic effects on the microbiome balance.Keywords: gut microbiota, prebiotics, obesity, cardiometabolic, inflammation, metabolic syndrome",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5523113/,abstract

It should be recognized that the explanatory ability of risk factor(s) for inter-individual variations in disease occurrence is different from the causal contribution of the risk factor(s) to disease occurrence. The affected subjects of the tobacco litigation in South Korea are lung cancer patients with a history of cigarette smoking. Thus, the attributable fraction of the exposed rather than the population attributable fraction should be used in the tobacco litigation regarding the causal contribution of smoking to lung cancer. Scientific evidence for the causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer is based on studies of individuals and groups, studies in animals and humans, studies that are observational or experimental, studies in laboratories and communities, and studies in both underdeveloped and developed countries. The scientific evidence collected is applicable to both groups and individuals. The probability of causation, which is calculated based on the attributable fraction for the association between smoking and lung cancer, could be utilized as evidence to prove causality in individuals.Keywords: Causality, Legislation and jurisprudence, Lung cancer, Smoking, South Korea, Tobacco",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4505180/,abstract

Almost 80% of children with health disorders lack the developmental skills to take full advantage of school-based education relative to 27% of children without a health disorder. In Canada, there is currently a dearth of nationally representative data on the social determinants of early childhood development for children with health disorders. Evidence from Canada and other countries indicate that poorer developmental outcomes in typically developing children are associated with lower socioeconomic status (SES). However, to date, it is not known whether this relationship is stronger among children with health disorders. The study’s objectives are to estimate the prevalence and to investigate social determinants of developmental outcomes for young children with health disorders, using the Early Development Instrument (EDI).Methods and analysisStudy objectives will be achieved through three steps. First, using existing EDI data for 10 provinces and 2 territories collected from 2004 to 2015, we will investigate differences in developmental health outcomes among children with identified health disorders. Second, population-level EDI data will be linked with neighbourhood sociodemographic census data to explore associations between socioeconomic characteristics and rates of specific diagnoses among children aged 5–6 years, including trends over time. Third, for 3 of these 12 regions, additional health and/or education databases will be linked at an individual level. These data will be used to establish differences in EDI outcomes in relation to the age-of-onset of diagnosis, and presence of intervention or treatment.Ethics and disseminationStudy methodologies have been approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board. The results of the analyses of developmental health outcomes for children with health disorders combined with SES will have implications for both health service delivery and school-based intervention strategies.

The objective of the present study was to analyze carbohydrate metabolism in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia.MethodsWe conducted a multicenter cross-sectional study to investigate biochemical markers of basal and postprandial carbohydrate metabolism in PKU patients according to age, Phe tolerance, waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), diet, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) supplementation, and adherence to treatment. Basal biomarkers and anthropometric parameters were also evaluated in patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHPA) and in healthy controls.ResultsA total of 83 patients aged 4–52 years were studied; 68.7% had PKU and 31.3% had MHPA. 68 healthy controls of similar sex and age were also evaluated Metabolic control was adequate in 71.9% of PKU patients. Fasting glucose levels (mean 80.77 ± 8.06 mg/dL) were high in just one patient, but fasting insulin levels, with a mean of 12.74 ± 8.4 mIU/L, were altered in 15 PKU patients (26.3%) and markedly higher than in patients with MPHA (p = 0.035). Fasting insulin levels and Homeostasis Model Assessment Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly higher than in healthy controls and correlated with body mass index, waist circumference, age, and also showed statistically significant differences according to diagnosis and Phe tolerance (p < 0.05). Patients under BH4 therapy had lower insulin levels and HOMA-IR. A higher mean carbohydrate intake from AA mixtures was observed in classic PKU patients. The caloric intake in the form of carbohydrates was also higher in PKU than MHPA patients (p = 0.038) and it was correlated with basal insulin (rho = 0.468, p = 0.006), HOMA-IR (rho = 0.423, p = 0.02), BMI (rho 0.533, p = 0.002), and waist circumference (rho 0.584, p = 0.0007).ConclusionsThis study shows that PKU patients are at risk of carbohydrate intolerance and insulin resistance, more evident in adults and overweight patients, probably related to their higher caloric intake in form carbohydrate content.

In addition, the role of learning on the CPIR to nutritive and low-calorie sweetener exposure was tested.Sixty-four overweight and obese adults (age: 18–50 yr, BMI: 24–37 kg/m2, body fat percentage > 25% for men and > 32% for women) were sham-fed (at 2-minute intervals for 14 minutes) a randomly assigned test load comprised of a nutritive (sucrose) or low calorie sweetener (sucralose) in beverage or solid form in phase 1 of the study. A 2–3 ml blood sample was collected before and 2, 6, 10, 14, 61, 91 and 121 minutes after oral exposure for serum insulin and glucose analysis. During phase 2, participants underwent a 2-week training period to facilitate associative learning between the sensory properties of test loads and their post-ingestive effects. In phase 3, participants were retested for their cephalic phase responses as in phase 1.Participants were classified as responders if they demonstrated a positive insulin response (rise of serum insulin above baseline i.e. Δ insulin) 2 minutes post-stimulus in phase 1. Among responders exposed to the same sweetener in Phases 1 and 3, the proportion of participants that displayed a rise of insulin with oral exposure to sucralose was significantly greater when the stimulus was in the solid form compared to the beverage form. Sucralose and sucrose exposure elicited similarly significant increases in serum insulin 2 minutes after exposure and significant decreases after 2 minutes in responders in both food forms. The solid food form elicited greater CPIR over 2, 6 and 10 minutes than the beverage form. There was no effect of learning on insulin responses after training. The results indicate the presence of a significant CPIR in a subset of individuals with overweight or obesity after oral exposure to sucralose, especially when present in solid food form.

Inherited mutations that result in PAH enzyme deficiency are the genetic cause of the autosomal recessive disorder phenylketonuria. Phe is the substrate for the PAH active site, but also an allosteric ligand that increases enzyme activity. Phe has been proposed to bind, in addition to the catalytic domain, a site at the PAH N-terminal regulatory domain (PAH-RD), to activate the enzyme via an unclear mechanism. Here we report the crystal structure of human PAH-RD bound with Phe at 1.8 Å resolution, revealing a homodimer of ACT folds with Phe bound at the dimer interface. This work delivers the structural evidence to support previous solution studies that a binding site exists in the RD for Phe, and that Phe binding results in dimerization of PAH-RD. Consistent with our structural observation, a disease-associated PAH mutant impaired in Phe binding disrupts the monomer:dimer equilibrium of PAH-RD. Our data therefore support an emerging model of PAH allosteric regulation, whereby Phe binds to PAH-RD and mediates the dimerization of regulatory modules that would bring about conformational changes to activate the enzyme.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4822156/,abstract

We applied NewbornDiscovery (SD Genomics), an integrated workflow design that encompasses analyte-phenotype-gene, single nucleotide variant/small insertion and deletion/copy number variation analyses along with clinical interpretation of genetic variants related to each participant's condition.ResultsA molecular genetic diagnosis was established in 95% (19/20) of individuals. In Group 1, 13 and 7 of 20 alleles were classified as pathogenic and likely pathogenic, respectively. In Group 2, 11 and 6 of 17 alleles with identified causative variants were pathogenic and likely pathogenic, respectively. There were no variants of uncertain significance. For each individual, the NewbornDiscovery and biochemical analysis results reached 100% concordance, since the single newborn testing negative for causative genetic variant in Group 2 showed a benign clinical course.ConclusionThis integrated diagnostic workflow resulted in a high yield.

It is very difficult to obtain accurate data on individual food intake, and there is a large variation of nutrient composition of foods consumed in a population. Thus, it is difficult to obtain precise measures of exposure to different nutrients and thereby be able to understand the relationship between diet, health, and disease. This is the background for investing considerable resources in studying biomarkers of nutrients believed to be important in our foods. Modern technology with high sensitivity and specificity concerning many nutrient biomarkers has allowed an interesting development with analyses of very small amounts of blood or tissue material. In combination with non-professional collection of blood by finger-pricking and collection on filters or sticks, this may make collection of samples and analyses of biomarkers much more available for scientists as well as health professionals and even lay people in particular in relation to the marked trend of self-monitoring of body functions linked to mobile phone technology. Assuming standard operating procedures are used for collection, drying, transport, extraction, and analysis of samples, it turns out that many analytes of nutritional interest can be measured like metabolites, drugs, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and many types of peptides and proteins. The advantage of this alternative sampling technology is that non-professionals can collect, dry, and mail the samples; the samples can often be stored under room temperature in a dry atmosphere, requiring small amounts of blood. Another promising area is the potential relation between the microbiome and biomarkers that may be measured in feces as well as in blood.Keywords: Dried blood spots (DBS), Biomarkers, Lipidomics, Nutrients, Microbiome, Diet",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4968438/,abstract

New genetic and bioinformatics strategies have yielded important clues to ASD genetic substrates. Next steps for understanding ASD pathogenesis require significant effort to focus on how genes and environment interact with one another in typical development and its perturbations. Along with larger sample sizes, future study designs should include sample ascertainment that is epidemiologic and population-based to capture the entire ASD spectrum with both categorical and dimensional phenotypic characterization, environmental measurement with accuracy, validity and biomarkers, statistical methods to address population stratification, multiple comparisons and GxE of rare variants, animal models to test hypotheses and, new methods to broaden the capacity to search for GxE, including genome-wide and environment-wide association studies, precise estimation of heritability using dense genetic markers and consideration of GxE both as the disease cause and a disease course modifier. While examination of GxE appears to be a daunting task, tremendous recent progress in gene discovery opens new horizons for advancing our understanding the role of GxE in the pathogenesis of, and ultimately identifying the causes, treatments and even prevention for ASD and other NDDs.Keywords: neurodevelopmental disorders, Autism Spectrum Disorders, genetic epidemiology, genes, environment, interactions",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4260177/,abstract

Further, several studies suggest that enduring mental and physical harm follow. It is time to analyze the health burdens posed by early social dominance and to consider the ethical implications of ongoing socially caused harms.METHODS:First, we reviewed research demonstrating the health impact of early childhood subordination. Second, we used philosophical conceptions of children’s rights and social justice to consider whether children have a right to protection and who has an obligation to protect them from social harms.RESULTS:Collectively, recent studies show that early subordination is instantiated biologically, increasing lifetime physical and mental health problems. The pervasive, and enduring nature of these harms leads us to argue that children have a right to be protected. Further, society has a role responsibility to protect children because society conscripts children into schools. Society’s promise to parents that schools will be fiduciaries entails an obligation to safeguard each child’s right to a reasonably open future. Importantly, this role responsibility holds independently of bearing any causal responsibility for the harm. This new argument based on protecting from harm is much stronger than previous equality of opportunity arguments, and applies broadly to other social determinants of health.CONCLUSIONS:Social institutions have a role responsibility to protect children that is not dependent on playing a causal role in the harm.

Liver biopsy was taken weekly to determine the change of transgene expression. Histological result of adult males showed mosaic lacZ expression but it was negative in adult females, while livers in neonatal stage showed comparable expression of lacZ.

Background: As part of the German Collaborative Study on Phenylketonuria (PKU)/Hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) Study Protocol, a Blaskovics protein loading test (180 mg phenylalanine (phe) protein equivalent per kg body weight and day for 72 h) had been applied to 145 children at the age of 6 months. For investigating possible age-related changes of metabolic phenotype, 51 of them received a 2nd loading test at 5 years of age.
Methods: Besides the analysis of blood phe levels, acidic phe transamination metabolites were quantified in urine.
Results: Compared to the 6-month data, the mean blood phe level 72 h after start of loading (Phe72) was found to be decreased by 7% (P = 0.06), whereas the mean urinary excretion (per 1.73 m2 body surface and day) of 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid was increased 1.9-fold (P < 0.01). Corresponding with these analytical data, the kinetic model constant k
out of metabolic plus renal phe disposal was found increased 1.3-fold in mean (P < 0.01).In 3 of the 51 patients, Phe72 was very high at 6 months while in the medium range at 5 years, suggesting that catabolic states may mimic a more severe metabolic defect.The blood phe level response of mild PKU (type II) was assigned identically at both ages in 7/9 patients. Diverging results were (i) response type III (mild hyperphenylalaninaemia) at 6 months and type II at 5 years and (ii) type II at 6 months and type III at age 5.
Conclusion: Renal elimination of OHPAA and phe tolerance increase significantly between the age of 6 months and 5 years, suggesting that, at least in childhood, formation and/or renal disposal of phe transamination metabolites may be major distal determinants of phe tolerance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5059183/,abstract

Newborn screening has been successful in markedly reducing the acute neonatal symptoms from this disorder. The dramatic response to dietary treatment is one of the major success stories of newborn screening. However, as children with galactosemia achieve adulthood, they face long-term complications. A majority of women with classic galactosemia develop primary ovarian insufficiency and resulting morbidity. The underlying pathophysiology of this complication is not clear. This review focuses on the reproductive issues seen in girls and women with classic galactosemia. Literature on the effects of classic galactosemia on the female reproductive system was reviewed by an extensive Pubmed search (publications from January 1975 to January 2017) using the keywords: galactosemia, ovarian function/dysfunction, primary ovarian insufficiency/failure, FSH, oxidative stress, fertility preservation. In addition, articles cited in the search articles and literature known to the authors was also included in the review. Our understanding of the role of galactose metabolism in the ovary is limited and the pathogenic mechanisms involved in causing primary ovarian insufficiency are unclear. The relative rarity of galactosemia makes it difficult to accumulate data to determine factors defining timing of ovarian dysfunction or treatment/fertility preservation options for this group of women.

To assess whether treatment with SNC can affect synapses, we treated PKU mice with SNC or an isocaloric control diet and wild-type (WT) mice with an isocaloric control for 12 weeks, starting at postnatal day 31. Immunostaining for post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), a post-synaptic density marker, was carried out in the hippocampus, striatum and prefrontal cortex. Compared to WT mice on normal chow without SNC, PKU mice on the isocaloric control showed a significant reduction in PSD-95 expression in the hippocampus, specifically in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus, with a similar trend seen in the cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) and cornus ammonis 3 (CA3) pyramidal cell layer. No differences were found in the striatum or prefrontal cortex. PKU mice on a diet supplemented with SNC showed improved expression of PSD-95 in the hippocampus.

Although nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs) are considered safe and well tolerated, their effects on glucose intolerance, the activation of sweet taste receptors, and alterations to the composition of the intestinal microbiota are controversial. This review critically discusses the evidence supporting the effects of NNSs, both synthetic sweeteners (acesulfame K, aspartame, cyclamate, saccharin, neotame, advantame, and sucralose) and natural sweeteners (NSs; thaumatin, steviol glucosides, monellin, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, and glycyrrhizin) and nutritive sweeteners (polyols or sugar alcohols) on the composition of microbiota in the human gut. So far, only saccharin and sucralose (NNSs) and stevia (NS) change the composition of the gut microbiota. By definition, a prebiotic is a nondigestible food ingredient, but some polyols can be absorbed, at least partially, in the small intestine by passive diffusion: however, a number of them, such as isomaltose, maltitol, lactitol, and xylitol, can reach the large bowel and increase the numbers of bifidobacteria in humans.

However, knowledge is lacking on what elements enhance self-management work.Persons with food hypersensitivity (FH) seem to do self-management work despite the relatively little support they receive. Our aim is to explore what makes women with FH carry out the work of managing their condition. Our research will shed light on the health care needs of women with FH and contribute to the knowledge on self-management among persons with chronic conditions.MethodsWe used the Self-determination theory and the Conservation of resources theory to analyze 16 qualitative individual interviews with women with FH aged 39–67 years.ResultsOur participants reported that eating selected foods resulted in uncomfortable symptoms, and their main motivation for carrying out self-management work was the wish to avoid these symptoms and their consequences.Participants’ individual resources were crucial to the management of FH, and those who had a social network that included people with relevant competencies clearly benefited from this.Hindrances to the management of FH included competing priorities and not wanting to break with the social expectation of sharing a meal.ConclusionsWomen with FH carried out self-management work because they were highly motivated. Important motivators included the uncomfortable symptoms that resulted from consuming some foods, which had negative consequences on their lives or could bring shame. The ability to perform self-management work was dependent on the availability of individual and social resources. Indeed, women with FH who have the individual and social resources necessary to manage their condition may not need health services, whereas those who do not have these resources, or have significant competing priorities, may need assistance from health services.The desire to avoid uncomfortable symptoms can be a motivator for persons with chronic conditions to do self-management work, while a lack of symptoms can reduce motivation. The competing role of basic needs can take two forms: when fulfilled, these needs may contribute to self-management work; however, people may opt out of self-management in order to fulfil basic needs.Keywords: Food hypersensitivity, Chronic conditions, Motivation, Resources, Conservation of resources (COR) theory, Self-determination theory",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6615186/,abstract

Additionally, older males seropositive for T. gondii had lower scores on measures of trait aggression, including self-aggression. Trait aggression may be influenced by dopaminergic signaling, which is known to be moderated by gender and age, and potentially enhanced in T. gondii positives through the intrinsic production of dopamine by the microorganism. Therefore, we investigated associations between trait aggression and interactions between T. gondii enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA) IgG titer-determined seropositivity and high-performance liquid chromatography- (HPLC-) measured blood levels of dopamine precursors phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr), and their ratio in a sample of 1000 psychiatrically healthy participants. Aggressive traits were assessed using the questionnaire for measuring factors of aggression (FAF), the German version of the Buss-Durkee hostility questionnaire. We found that 1) the decrease in trait aggression scores in T. gondii-positive older males was only present in individuals with a low Phe:Tyr ratio, and 2) that there was a positive correlation between Phe:Tyr ratio and total aggression and selected subscales of aggression in T. gondii-positive males, but not in T. gondii-negative males. These findings point toward a gender-specific reciprocal moderation by Phe:Tyr ratio and T. gondii seropositivity of their associations with aggression scores, and lead to experimental interventions geared to manipulating levels of dopamine precursors in selected T. gondii positive individuals with increased propensity for aggression.Keywords: aggressive personality traits, phenylalanine, seropositivity, Toxoplasma gondii, tyrosine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5608274/,abstract

As a consequence, cells have adopted a number of protein quality control pathways to prevent protein aggregation, promote protein folding, and target terminally misfolded proteins for degradation. In this study, we employed a thermosensitive allele of the yeast Guk1 guanylate kinase as a model misfolded protein to investigate degradative protein quality control pathways. We performed a flow cytometry based screen to identify factors that promote proteasomal degradation of proteins misfolded as the result of missense mutations. In addition to the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr1, we identified the prefoldin chaperone subunit Gim3 as an important quality control factor. Whereas the absence of GIM3 did not impair proteasomal function or the ubiquitination of the model substrate, it led to the accumulation of the poorly soluble model substrate in cellular inclusions that was accompanied by delayed degradation. We found that Gim3 interacted with the Guk1 mutant allele and propose that prefoldin promotes the degradation of the unstable model substrate by maintaining the solubility of the misfolded protein.

PKU is identified through newborn screening in developed countries, and treatment begins immediately to prevent these severe consequences. When a child is diagnosed, parents must assume immediate responsibility for the management of PKU and prevention of neurological damage. Quantitative studies have identified significant psychosocial stressors for parents, but little is known about how the parents experience this process. This study aimed to explore the experiences of parents of children with PKU under the age of two. It is the first study to examine these experiences in this way. Seven parents were interviewed about their experiences, and interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse the data. Three main themes were identified: control, striving for normality and acceptance of PKU as a continuum. Links between the themes and processes underpinning the results were explored with relation to existing literature and theories from a clinical psychology perspective.

Ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated gene editing in hepatocytes using homology‐directed repair (HDR) is a potential alternative curative therapy to organ transplantation for metabolic liver disease. However, a major limitation of this approach in quiescent adult primary hepatocytes is that nonhomologous end‐joining is the predominant DNA repair pathway for double‐strand breaks (DSBs). This study explored the hypothesis that ex vivo hepatocyte culture could reprogram hepatocytes to favor HDR after CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated DNA DSBs. Quantitative PCR (qPCR), RNA sequencing, and flow cytometry demonstrated that within 24 hours, primary mouse hepatocytes in ex vivo monolayer culture decreased metabolic functions and increased expression of genes related to mitosis progression and HDR. Despite the down‐regulation of hepatocyte function genes, hepatocytes cultured for up to 72 hours could robustly engraft in vivo. To assess functionality long‐term, primary hepatocytes from a mouse model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 bearing a single‐point mutation were transduced ex vivo with two adeno‐associated viral vectors to deliver the Cas9 nuclease, target guide RNAs, and a 1.2‐kb homology template. Adeno‐associated viral Cas9 induced robust cutting at the target locus, and, after delivery of the repair template, precise correction of the point mutation occurred by HDR. Edited hepatocytes were transplanted into recipient fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase knockout mice, resulting in engraftment, robust proliferation, and prevention of liver failure. Weight gain and biochemical assessment revealed normalization of metabolic function. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the potential therapeutic effect of ex vivo hepatocyte‐directed gene editing after reprogramming to cure metabolic disease in a preclinical model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6442694/,abstract

Because MC vectors lack a defined size limit, we constructed a MC vector expressing a codon-optimized murine Pah cDNA that includes a truncated intron and is under the transcriptional control of a 3.6-kb native Pah promoter/enhancer sequence. This vector, delivered via hydrodynamic injection, yielded therapeutic liver PAH activity and sustained correction of blood phenylalanine comparable to viral or synthetic liver promoters. Therapeutic efficacy was seen with vector copy numbers of <1 vector genome per diploid hepatocyte genome and was achieved at a vector dose that was significantly lowered. Partial hepatectomy and subsequent liver regeneration was associated with >95% loss of vector genomes and PAH activity in liver, demonstrating that MC vectors had not integrated into the liver genome.

hph-1 mice, which display deficiency in BH4 synthesis, were used to characterize the inflammatory effects and the integrity of retinal microvasculature. BH4 levels in retinas from hph-1 and wild type ﻿(WT)﻿ mice were measured by LC-MS/MS. Retinal microvascular area and microglial cells number were quantified in hph-1 and WT mice at different ages. Retinal expression of pro-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and neuronal-derived factors was analyzed by qPCR. BH4 supplementation was evaluated in vitro, ex-vivo, and in vivo models.ResultsOur findings demonstrated that BH4 levels in the retina from hph-1 mice were significantly lower by ~ 90% at all ages analyzed compared to WT mice. Juvenile hph-1 mice showed iris atrophy, persistent fetal vasculature, significant increase in the number of microglial cells (p < 0.01), as well as a marked degeneration of the retinal microvasculature.

The present study compared HRQoL scores in core dimensions of Brazilian early-treated PKU pediatric patients with those of a reference population, and explored possible relationships between adherence to treatment and HRQoL. Early-treated PKU pediatric patient HRQoL was evaluated by self- and parent-proxy reports of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) core scales. Adherence to treatment was evaluated by median Phe levels and percentage of results within the therapeutic target range in two periods. Means for total and core scales scores of PedsQL self- and parent proxy-reports of PKU patients were significantly lower than their respective means for controls. Adequacy of median Phe concentrations and the mean percentage of values in the target range fell substantially from the first year of life to the last year of this study. There was no significant difference in mean total and core scale scores for self- and parent proxy-reports between patients with adequate and those with inadequate median Phe concentrations.

Metrics of the impact of joint effects or comparisons of joint effects presented in units of absolute risk, such as Rothman's I, can provide more meaningful quantitative measures of public health impact than unitless metrics (e.g., ratios) and standardized metrics (e.g., the population attributable fraction) of potential interventions for reducing smoking and air pollution exposure.

The search located seven journal articles, 10 textbooks, and one dictionary. The search platforms used were Pubmed, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Medline-OVID and Scopus under the Epidemiology and Biostatics subject head listed with Life Sciences.ResultsDescriptions of screening give varying emphasis to whether it is a test or a program, the aims of screening, the setting in which it is conducted, eligibility criteria, who initiates and who is intended to benefit and whether the condition being screened is an infectious or chronic disease or a risk-elevated state. Four essentially different ‘types’ of screening are described, using seven terms and occasionally contradictory examples. The detection of asymptomatic infectious cases is gradually changing from screening to surveillance as part of infection control.ConclusionVoluntary screening programs rely on high participation to be effective and support and trust of the public are essential for the continued success of the public health profession.

and identities of the underlying causal variants are ambiguous. In such cases, statistical
methods that model effects of multiple SNPs simultaneously can help disentangle the
observed patterns of association and provide information about how those SNPs could be
prioritized for follow-up studies. Current multi-SNP methods, however, tend to assume that
SNP effects are well captured by additive genetics; yet when genetic dominance is present,
this assumption translates to reduced power and faulty prioritizations. We describe a
statistical procedure for prioritizing SNPs at GWAS loci that efficiently models both
additive and dominance effects. Our method, LLARRMA-dawg, combines a group LASSO procedure
for sparse modeling of multiple SNP effects with a resampling procedure based on
fractional observation weights; it estimates for each SNP the robustness of association
with the phenotype both to sampling variation and to competing explanations from other
SNPs. In producing a SNP prioritization that best identifies underlying true signals, we
show that: our method easily outperforms a single marker analysis; when additive-only
signals are present, our joint model for additive and dominance is equivalent to or only
slightly less powerful than modeling additive-only effects; and, when dominance signals
are present, even in combination with substantial additive effects, our joint model is
unequivocally more powerful than a model assuming additivity. We also describe how
performance can be improved through calibrated randomized penalization, and discuss how
dominance in ungenotyped SNPs can be incorporated through either heterozygote dosage or

Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—rs2393791 and rs7305618—located in HNF1A were genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY system.ResultsThe allele frequencies of SNP rs7305618 had significant differences between PCOS patients and controls after adjusting for age and BMI (p = 0.023). Besides, PCOS patients carrying the rs7305618 CC genotype shown a higher testosterone level than the patients with CT + TT genotypes after being adjusted by age and BMI (p = 0.019).ConclusionsA SNP located in the HNF1A gene is associated with PCOS among Han Chinese women.

Given that sarcopenia has been recognized as a disease entity, effective molecular biomarkers for early diagnosis are required. We recruited 46 normal subjects and 50 patients with moderate sarcopenia aged 60 years and older. Sarcopenia was clinically identified on the basis of the appendicular skeletal muscle index by applying cutoff values derived from the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. The serum levels of 21 potential biomarkers were analyzed and statistically examined. Interleukin 6, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, and insulin-like growth factor 1 levels differed significantly between the normal and sarcopenia groups. However, in each case, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was <0.7. Subsequent combination of the measurements of these biomarkers into a single risk score based on logistic regression coefficients enhanced the accuracy of diagnosis, yielding an AUC value of 0.763. The best cutoff value of 1.529 had 70.0% sensitivity and 78.3% specificity (95% CI = 2.80–21.69, p < 0.0001). Combined use of the selected biomarkers provides higher diagnostic accuracy than individual biomarkers, and may be effectively utilized for early diagnosis and prognosis of sarcopenia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5988732/,abstract

Multivariate analysis of the NMR metabolomic profiles showed a clear discrimination (up to of 80% accuracy) between the DS and the control groups. The univariate analysis of plasma and urine revealed a significant alteration for some interesting metabolites. Remarkably, most of the altered concentrations were consistent with the 3:2 gene dosage model, suggesting effects caused by the presence of three copies of Hsa21 rather than two: DS/normal ratio in plasma was 1.23 (pyruvate), 1.47 (succinate), 1.39 (fumarate), 1.33 (lactate), 1.4 (formate).

One way to circumvent the difficulties in the lack of source information is to integrate available external information by using one of up-to-date integration or fusion methods. However, if one wants a disease network placing huge emphasis on the original source of data but still utilizing external sources only to complement it, integration may not be pertinent. Interpretation on the integrated network would be ambiguous: meanings conferred on edges would be vague due to fused information.MethodsIn this study, we propose a network based algorithm that complements the original network by utilizing external information while preserving the network’s originality. The proposed algorithm links the disconnected node to the disease network by using complementary information from external data source through four steps: anchoring, connecting, scoring, and stopping.ResultsWhen applied to the network of metabolic diseases that is sourced from protein-protein interaction data, the proposed algorithm recovered connections by 97%, and improved the AUC performance up to 0.71 (lifted from 0.55) by using the external information outsourced from text mining results on PubMed comorbidity literatures. Experimental results also show that the proposed algorithm is robust to noisy external information.ConclusionThis research has novelty in which the proposed algorithm preserves the network’s originality, but at the same time, complements it by utilizing external information.

To ensure patient comfort and compliance during treatment, the prevention or management of pain is of major importance. While pharmacological means are the first line of treatment for alleviation of orthodontic pain, a range of non‐pharmacological approaches have been proposed recently as viable alternatives.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of non‐pharmacological interventions to alleviate pain associated with orthodontic treatment.Search methodsCochrane Oral Health’s Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register (to 6 October 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 9), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 6 October 2016), Embase Ovid (1980 to 6 October 2016) and EThOS (to 6 October 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.Selection criteriaRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a non‐pharmacological orthodontic pain intervention to a placebo, no intervention or another non‐pharmacological pain intervention were eligible for inclusion. We included any type of orthodontic treatment but excluded trials involving the use of pre‐emptive analgesia or pain relief following orthognathic (jaw) surgery or dental extractions in combination with orthodontic treatment. We excluded split‐mouth trials (in which each participant receives two or more treatments, each to a separate section of the mouth) and cross‐over trials.Data collection and analysisAt least two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We used the random‐effects model and expressed results as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We investigated heterogeneity with reference to both clinical and methodological factors.Main resultsWe included 14 RCTs that randomised 931 participants. Interventions assessed included: low‐level laser therapy (LLLT) (4 studies); vibratory devices (5 studies); chewing adjuncts (3 studies); brain wave music or cognitive behavioural therapy (1 study) and post‐treatment communication in the form of a text message (1 study). Twelve studies involved self‐report assessment of pain on a continuous scale and two studies used questionnaires to assess the nature, intensity and location of pain.We combined data from two studies involving 118 participants, which provided low‐quality evidence that LLLT reduced pain at 24 hours by 20.27 mm (95% CI ‐24.50 to ‐16.04, P < 0.001; I² = 0%). LLLT also appeared to reduce pain at six hours, three days and seven days.Results for the other comparisons assessed are inconclusive as the quality of the evidence was very low. Vibratory devices were assessed in five studies (272 participants), four of which were at high risk of bias and one unclear. Chewing adjuncts (chewing gum or a bite wafer) were evaluated in three studies (181 participants); two studies were at high risk of bias and one was unclear. Brain wave music and cognitive behavioural therapy were evaluated in one trial (36 participants) assessed at unclear risk of bias. Post‐treatment text messaging (39 participants) was evaluated in one study assessed at high risk of bias.Adverse effects were not measured in any of the studies.Authors' conclusionsOverall, the results are inconclusive. Although available evidence suggests laser irradiation may help reduce pain during orthodontic treatment in the short term, this evidence is of low quality and therefore we cannot rely on the findings. Evidence for other non‐pharmacological interventions is either very low quality or entirely lacking. Further prospective research is required to address the lack of reliable evidence concerning the effectiveness of a range of non‐pharmacological interventions to manage orthodontic pain.

However, little is known about a possible causal role of inflammation in metabolic disorders. Mexico is among the countries with the highest obesity rates in the world and the admixed Mexican population is a relevant sample due to high levels of genetic diversity.Methods: Here, we studied 1,462 Mexican children recruited from Mexico City. Six genetic variants in five inflammation-related genes were genotyped: rs1137101 (leptin receptor (LEPR)), rs7305618 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1A)), rs1800629 (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA)), rs1800896, rs1800871 (interleukin-10 (IL-10)), rs1862513 (resistin (RETN)). Ten continuous and eight binary traits were assessed. Linear and logistic regression models were used adjusting for age, sex, and recruitment centre.Results: We found that one SNP displayed a nominal evidence of association with a continuous trait: rs1800871 (IL-10) with LDL (beta = −0.068 ± 1.006, P = 0.01). Subsequently, we found one nominal association with a binary trait: rs7305618 (HNF1A) with family history of hypertension (odds-ratio = 1.389 [1.054–1.829], P = 0.02).

Erwinia asparaginase is efficacious, but has a short half-life, requiring six doses to replace one dose of the most commonly used first-line asparaginase, pegaspargase, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated E. coli asparaginase. Pegcristantaspase, a recombinant PEGylated Erwinia asparaginase with improved pharmacokinetics, was developed for patients with hypersensitivity to pegaspargase. Here, we report a series of patients treated on a pediatric phase 2 trial of pegcrisantaspase.ProcedurePediatric patients with ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma and hypersensitivity to pegaspargase enrolled on Children's Oncology Group trial AALL1421 (Jazz 13-011) and received intravenous pegcrisantaspase. Serum asparaginase activity (SAA) was monitored before and after dosing; immunogenicity assays were performed for antiasparaginase and anti-PEG antibodies and complement activation was evaluated.ResultsThree of the four treated patients experienced hypersensitivity to pegcrisantaspase manifested as clinical hypersensitivity reactions or rapid clearance of SAA. Immunogenicity assays demonstrated the presence of anti-PEG immunoglobulin G antibodies in all three hypersensitive patients, indicating a PEG-mediated immune response.ConclusionsThis small series of patients, nonetheless, provides data, suggesting preexisting immunogenicity against the PEG moiety of pegaspargase and poses the question as to whether PEGylation may be an effective strategy to optimize Erwinia asparaginase administration.

Thus far, however, extensive liver repopulation by adult hepatocytes has required ongoing genetic, physical, or chemical injury to host liver. We hypothesized that providing a regulated proliferative and/or survival advantage to transplanted hepatocytes should enable repopulation in a normal liver microenvironment. Here, we repopulated livers of DPPIV− (dipeptidyl peptidase‐4) rats and Ugt1a1 (uridinediphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase 1a1)‐deficient Gunn rats (model of Crigler‐Najjar syndrome type 1), both models without underlying liver injury, for up to 1 year by transplanting lenti‐hYAP‐ERT2 (mutated estrogen receptor ligand‐binding domain 2)‐transduced hepatocytes (YAP‐Hc). Yap (yes‐associated protein) nuclear translocation/function in YAP‐Hc was regulated by tamoxifen. Repopulating YAP‐Hc and host hepatocytes were fluorescence‐activated cell sorting–purified and their transcriptomic profiles compared by RNAseq. After 1 year of liver repopulation, YAP‐Hc clusters exhibited normal morphology, integration into hepatic plates and hepatocyte‐specific gene expression, without dysplasia, dedifferentiation, or tumorigenesis. RNAseq analysis showed up‐regulation of 145 genes promoting cell proliferation and 305 genes suppressing apoptosis, including hepatocyte growth factor and connective tissue growth factor among the top 30 in each category and provided insight into the mechanism of cell competition that enabled replacement of host hepatocytes by YAP‐Hc. In Gunn rats transplanted with YAP‐Hc+tamoxifen, there was a 65%‐81% decline in serum bilirubin over 6 months versus 8%‐20% with control‐Hc, representing a 3‐4‐fold increase in therapeutic response. This correlated with liver repopulation as demonstrated by the presence of Ugt1a1‐positive hepatocyte clusters in livers and western blot analysis of tissue homogenates. Conclusion: Tamoxifen‐regulated nuclear translocation/function of hYAP‐ERT2 enabled long‐term repopulation of DPPIV−/− and Gunn rat livers by hYAP‐ERT2‐transduced hepatocytes without tumorigenesis.

Preliminary results from a single-stranded feasibility study of a multi-component weight management intervention specifically designed for adults with intellectual disabilities and obesity (TAKE 5) and that satisfied clinical recommendations reported that it was acceptable to adults with intellectual disabilities and their carers. This study aims to determine the feasibility of a full-scale clinical trial of TAKE 5.MethodsThis study will follow a pilot randomised trial design. Sixty-six obese participants (body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2) will be randomly allocated to the TAKE 5 multi-component weight management intervention or a health education ‘active’ control intervention (Waist Winners Too (WWToo)). Both interventions will be delivered over a 12-month period.

Therefore, maintaining an appropriate iron balance is essential to ensure sufficient energy production and to avoid excessive reactive oxygen species formation. Iron overload impairs mitochondrial fitness; however, little is known about the associated metabolic changes. Here we aimed to characterize the metabolic signature triggered by dietary iron overload over time in a mouse model, where mice received either a standard or a high-iron diet. Metabolic profiling was assessed in blood, plasma and liver tissue. Peripheral blood was collected by means of volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS). Extracted blood and tissue metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography combined to high resolution mass spectrometry. Upon dietary iron loading we found increased glucose, aspartic acid and 2-/3-hydroxybutyric acid levels but low lactate and malate levels in peripheral blood and plasma, pointing to a re-programming of glucose homeostasis and the Krebs cycle. Further, iron loading resulted in the stimulation of the urea cycle in the liver. In addition, oxidative stress was enhanced in circulation and coincided with increased liver glutathione and systemic cysteine synthesis. Overall, iron supplementation affected several central metabolic circuits over time. Hence, in vivo investigation of metabolic signatures represents a novel and useful tool for getting deeper insights into iron-dependent regulatory circuits and for monitoring of patients with primary and secondary iron overload, and those ones receiving iron supplementation therapy.Keywords: iron, metabolomics, VAMS, mitochondria, glucose, urea cycle, oxidative stress",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315421/,abstract

We searched PubMED and CINAHL databases for literature published between January 2000 and April 2013. OECD countries were used to determine the HIC and different terms were used to refer to community based interventions, defined as those “delivered in community settings or any activities occurring outside of health facilities”.Results119 publications were selected for inclusion in this mapping study. 95 (80%) were Randomised Control Trials (RCTs) and 24 (20%) were systematic reviews (SRs). We categorised the study topics according to the main interventions covered: breastfeeding assistance and promotion, preventing and treating post-natal depression, interventions to support and build capacity around parenting and child care, antenatal interventions preparing women for birth, postnatal planning of future births and control trials around changing maternal behaviours. The home was used as the most common setting to implement these interventions and health professionals accounted for the largest group of intervention providers.ConclusionsThis review maps and brings knowledge on the type of studies and topics being addressed in community based interventions around maternal health in HICs.

The mutation was identified in an infant who came to clinical attention due to infantile spasms at 3 months of age. Clinical exome sequencing revealed heterozygosity for a HSPE1 NM_002157.2:c.217C>T de novo mutation causing replacement of leucine with phenylalanine at position 73 of the HSP10 protein. This variation has never been observed in public exome sequencing databases or the literature. To evaluate whether the mutation may be disease-associated we investigated its effects by in vitro and ex vivo studies. Our in vitro studies indicated that the purified mutant protein was functional, yet its thermal stability, spontaneous refolding propensity, and resistance to proteolytic treatment were profoundly impaired. Mass spectrometric analysis of patient fibroblasts revealed barely detectable levels of HSP10-p.Leu73Phe protein resulting in an almost 2-fold decrease of the ratio of HSP10 to HSP60 subunits. Amounts of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD2, a protein whose folding is known to strongly depend on the HSP60/HSP10 complex, were decreased to approximately 20% in patient fibroblasts in spite of unchanged SOD2 transcript levels. As a likely consequence, mitochondrial superoxide levels were increased about 2-fold. Although, we cannot exclude other causative or contributing factors, our experimental data support the notion that the HSP10-p.Leu73Phe mutation could be the cause or a strong contributing factor for the disorder in the described patient.Keywords: protein folding, molecular chaperones, mitochondrial proteins, neurological disorders, De novo mutations, oxidative stress",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5053987/,abstract

We reviewed the strengths and limitations of claims-only databases and how other data sources may be used to improve the accuracy and completeness of information critical for studying medication safety in pregnancy.Recent FindingsResearch on medication safety in pregnancy requires information on pregnancy episodes, mother-infant linkage, medication exposure, gestational age, maternal and birth outcomes, confounding factors, and (in some studies) long-term follow-up data. Claims data reliably identifies live births and possibly other pregnancies. It allows mother-infant linkage and has prospectively collected prescription medication information. Its diagnosis and procedure information allows estimation of gestational age. It captures maternal medical conditions but generally has incomplete data on reproductive and lifestyle factors. It has information on certain, typically short-term maternal and infant outcomes that may require chart review confirmation. Other data sources including electronic health records and birth registries can augment claims data or be analyzed alone. Interviews, surveys, or biological samples provide additional information.

It also plays a key role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Free radical generation is a common phenomenon that occurs in cells under healthy as well as under stress conditions such as ageing, inflammation, alcohol consumption, and smoking. These free radicals attack the cell membranes and generate highly reactive lipid peroxidation products such as 4-oxononenal (4-ONE). BiP is a key protein that is modified by 4-ONE. In this study, we probed how such chemical modification affects the biophysical properties of BiP. Upon modification, BiP shows significant tertiary structural changes with no changes in its secondary structure. The protein loses its thermodynamic stability, particularly, that of the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) where ATP binds. In terms of function, the modified BiP completely loses its ATPase activity with decreased ATP binding affinity. However, modified BiP retains its immunoglobulin binding function and its chaperone activity of suppressing non-specific protein aggregation. These results indicate that 4-ONE modification can significantly affect the structure-function of key proteins such as BiP involved in cellular pathways, and provide a molecular basis for how chemical modifications can result in the failure of quality control mechanisms inside the cell.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590874/,abstract

We focused on one amino acid metabolic enzyme, L-amino acid oxidase (LAO), and investigated the importance of LAO in brain function using LAO1 knockout (KO) mice. Compared to wild-type mice, LAO1 KO mice exhibited impaired fear learning and memory function in a passive avoidance test. This impairment in LAO1 KO mice coincided with significantly reduced hippocampal acetylcholine levels compared to wild-type mice, while treatment with donepezil, a reversible acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, inhibited this reduction. Metabolomic analysis revealed that knocking out LAO1 affected amino acid metabolism (mainly of phenylalanine [Phe]) in the hippocampus. Specifically, Phe levels were elevated in LAO1 KO mice, while phenylpyruvic acid (metabolite of Phe produced largely by LAO) levels were reduced. Moreover, knocking out LAO1 decreased hippocampal mRNA levels of pyruvate kinase, the enzymatic activity of which is known to be inhibited by Phe. Based on our findings, we propose that LAO1 KO mice exhibited impaired fear learning and memory owing to low hippocampal acetylcholine levels.

While it was unclear how prevalent genetic discrimination was, GINA was enacted preemptively to prevent discrimination in insurance and employment. It also created uniform protections to remedy a confusing patchwork of state and federal protections. Finally, Congress hoped GINA would allay public fears of genetic discrimination that discouraged people from undergoing genetic testing and participating in genetics research. To address those fears, Congress enacted robust protections against genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment, in part, by defining ‘genetic information’ as broadly as possible.Over the last ten years, however, the courts have been battling over the meaning of ‘genetic information’. One interpretive approach adheres strictly to GINA's statutory language; the second interprets the definition restrictively and contrary to the plain meaning of GINA and its underlying goals. While this interpretive conflict demonstrates the difficulty of distinguishing genetic information from non-medical information, this article argues for the broader interpretation. Such an interpretation reflects Congress's choice among imperfect definitional options and it furthers the goal of creating strong protections in health insurance and employment.

While elevations in m-tyrosine and o-tyrosine concentrations have been used as a biological marker of oxidative stress, there is emerging evidence from bacterial, plant, and mammalian studies demonstrating that these isomers, particularly m-tyrosine, directly produce adverse effects to cells and tissues. These new findings suggest that the abnormal tyrosine isomers could in fact represent mediators of the effects of oxidative stress. Consequently the accumulation of m- and o-tyrosine may disrupt cellular homeostasis and contribute to disease pathogenesis, and as result, effective defenses against oxidative stress can encompass not only the elimination of reactive oxygen species but also the metabolism and ultimately the removal of the abnormal tyrosine isomers from the cellular amino acid pool. Future research in this area is needed to clarify the biologic mechanisms by which the tyrosine isomers damage cells and disrupt the function of tissues and organs, and to identify the metabolic pathways involved in removing the accumulated isomers after exposure to oxidative stress.Keywords: meta-tyrosine, ortho-tyrosine, tyrosine isomers, oxidative stress, hydroxyl radical, aging",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4841466/,abstract

Defining ID as a health condition is central to retaining it in ICD, with significant implications for health policy and access to health services. The purpose of this paper is to include some reflections on the consensus document produced by the first WHO Working Group on the Classification of MR (WHO WG-MR) and on the process that was followed to realize it. The consensus report was the basis for the development of official recommendations sent to the WHO Advisory Group for ICD-11.Design/methodology/approachA mixed qualitative approach was followed in a series of meetings leading to the final consensus report submitted to the WHO Advisory group. These recommendations combined prior expert knowledge with available evidence; a nominal approach was followed throughout with face-to-face conferences.FindingsThe WG recommended a synonym set (“synset”) ontological approach to the conceptualisation of this health condition underlying a clinical rationale for its diagnosis. It proposed replacing MR with Intellectual Developmental Disorders (IDD) in ICD-11, defined as “a group of developmental conditions characterized by a significant impairment of cognitive functions, which are associated with limitations of learning, adaptive behaviour and skills”. The WG further advised that IDD be included under the parent category of neurodevelopmental disorders, that current distinctions (mild, moderate, severe and profound) be continued as severity qualifiers, and that problem behaviours removed from its core classification structure and instead described as associated features.Originality/valueWithin the ID/IDD synset two different names combine distinct aspects under a single construct that describes its clinical as well as social, educational and policy utilities. The single construct incorporates IDD as a clinical meta-syndrome, and ID as its functioning and disability counterpart. IDD and ID are not synonymous or mirror concepts as they have different scientific, social and policy applications. New diagnostic criteria for IDD should be based on a developmental approach, which accounts for the complex causal factors known to impact the acquisition of specific cognitive abilities and adaptive behaviours. The paper focuses on a new clinical framework for the diagnosis of IDD that also includes and complements the existing social, educational and policy components inherent in ID.Keywords: Classification, Diagnosis, Intellectual disability, Health terminology, Intellectual developmental disorders, Mental retardation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4822711/,abstract

Between the baseline and end-line surveys, anaemia prevalence decreased more in the intervention county than in the control county (71.1% to 47.8% vs 86.3% to 75.3%, respectively; p<0.0001). There was no difference in the decrease in stunting prevalence between the counties (9.7% to 7.1% vs 17.0% to 15.0%; p=0.7954). The proportions of children given iron-rich or iron-fortified food, introduced to (semi-) solid food at 6–8 months, and given food with minimum dietary diversity increased from 43.2% to 88.8% (p<0.0001), 81.4% to 96% (p=0.0470) and 53.0% to 59.8% (p<0.0001), respectively in the intervention county.ConclusionsWe found much higher anaemia prevalence in poor rural areas of Qinghai Province compared with the national data. Community-based complementary food supplements combined with dietary counselling can improve feeding practices and reduce anaemia prevalence. Future studies should use longer follow-up to assess the effects on stunting.Strengths and limitationsWe included a large number of participants and assessed a combined complementary food supplements and dietary counselling intervention in a poor rural area in China with high anaemia prevalence. Although the study took place in only one intervention county and one control county, we conducted an analysis that controlled for differences between the two counties. Also, although we made significant efforts to train village doctors, their education was not systematically assessed after training and thus their delivery of the interventions may have been variable.Trial registration numberChiCTRPRC12002444; Pre-results.Keywords: Undernutrition, complementary food supplements, dietary counseling, anemia, China",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5093399/,abstract

In the new era of precision medicine, nutritional genomics holds the promise to be translated into tailored nutritional strategies to prevent and manage polygenic diseases more effectively. Nutritional genomics aims to prevent, treat, and manage polygenic diseases through targeted therapies formulated from individuals’ genetic makeup and dietary intake. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) has become commercially available to equip individuals with information on their genetic vulnerability to different diseases. This information may potentially prompt behavioral changes against adverse factors. However, scientific evidence behind the clinical recommendations is a matter of continuous debate, and behavioral modifications after disclosing genetic information remain inconclusive. In this review, we provide an overview of nutritional genomics and related nutritional DTC-GT services and discuss whether available data are sufficient to be translated into clinical recommendations and public health initiatives. Overall, the scientific evidence supporting the dissemination of genomic information for nutrigenomic purposes remains sparse.

The demographic and epidemiological characteristics are similar to those of developed countries, with a high burden associated with congenital anomalies. Infant mortality rate (IMR) decreased from 37/1000 live births, in 1980, to 8.8/1000, in 2013. This is largely explained by medical and social policies. IMR related to congenital anomalies, however, remained unchanged for the last 30 years. Therefore, programmes for prevention of congenital disorders were developed, such as the National Newborn Screening Programme. Mandatory, universal, free infant screening was implemented two decades ago. The Ministry of Public Health created the Comprehensive Plan on Birth Defects and Rare Diseases (PIDCER), to develop a strategic public policy tool enabling comprehensive, universal, quality care during their entire lifetime. Recent national legislation created provisions for newborn and infant screening, including for congenital hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, cystic fibrosis and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, via blood spot test, otoacoustic emissions, systematic physical examination and hip ultrasound. We discuss how this programme was implemented, the current situation of rare diseases, the institution managing disability in Uruguay and the development of new laws based on the MPH’s PIDCER.

PKU can be effectively treated with a low phenylalanine diet, but some cognitive deficits remain. Studies have reported impairments, especially for processing speed and executive functions, but there is a lack of comprehensive assessment across cognitive domains. Moreover, it is important to establish outcomes in early treated adults with PKU (AwPKU) who have better metabolic control than groups previously reported in the literature. Method: We tested 37 AwPKU with an unprecedented number of tasks (N = 28) and measures (N = 44) and compared results with 30 controls matched for age and education. Results: We found (a) group impairments, particularly in tasks tapping speed of processing and complex executive functions; (b) high variability across participants, with a sizable number of AwPKU with completely normal performance (about 38%); (c) but also a sizable number of participants who were clearly impaired (about 24%); and (d) good performance in tasks tapping verbal learning, verbal memory and orthographic processing, indicating no generalized learning impairment.

recommended to aid in establishing working diagnoses that facilitate
appropriate biochemical and genetic investigations. This retrospective pilot
study investigated the validity and diagnostic utility of this algorithm
when applied to white matter signal abnormalities (WMSAs) reported on
imaging studies of patients seen in our clinics.MethodsThe MRI algorithm was applied to 31 patients selected from patients attending
the neurometabolic/neurogenetic/metabolic/neurology clinics at a tertiary
care hospital. These patients varied in age from 5 months to 79 years old,
and were reported to have WMSAs on cranial MRI scans. Twenty-one patients
had confirmed WMA diagnoses and 10 patients had non-specific WMA diagnoses
(etiology unknown). Two radiologists, blinded to confirmed diagnoses, used
clinical abstracts and the WMSAs present on patient MRI scans to classify
possible WMA diagnoses utilizing the algorithm.ResultsThe MRI algorithm displayed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 30.0% and
a positive predicted value of 74.1%. Cohen’s kappa statistic for
inter-radiologist agreement was 0.733, suggesting “good” agreement between
radiologists.ConclusionsAlthough a high diagnostic utility was not observed, results suggest that
this MRI algorithm has promise as a clinical tool for clinicians and

This differential susceptibility to social and physical environments operates bidirectionally, in both adverse and beneficial contexts, and results in a minority subpopulation with remarkably poor or unusually positive trajectories of health and development, contingent upon the character of environmental conditions. Differences in contextual susceptibility appear to emerge in early development, as the interactive and adaptive product of genetic and environmental attributes. This paper surveys what is currently known of the mechanisms or mediators of differential susceptibility, at the levels of temperament and behavior, physiological systems, brain circuitry and neuronal function, and genetic and epigenetic variation.

We have found that the rate of homology-directed recombination mediated by guideRNA (gRNA) complementary to the deletion mutant is significantly higher than the one mediated by gRNA complementary to the wild-type (WT) donor. In addition, the rate of homology-directed recombination mediated by gRNA complementary to the WT donor is significantly higher than that of gRNAs complementary to the 5′ or 3′ side of the deletion mutant. Interestingly, the frequency of mutations introduced by gRNA complementary to the deletion mutant is significantly higher than with gRNA complementary to WT donor. However, combination of gRNAs complementary to both WT donor and deletion mutant decreased the rate of homology-directed recombination, but did not significantly decrease the mutation rate introduced by this system.

There is a lack of properly designed randomized controlled studies to assess their efficacy in different populations, whereas observational studies often remain confounded due to reverse causality and often yield opposite findings. Pregnant and lactating women, children, diabetics, migraine, and epilepsy patients represent the susceptible population to the adverse effects of NNS-containing products and should use these products with utmost caution.

Low DHA intakes might explain subtle neurological deficits in PKU. We studied whether a DHA supply modified plasma DHA and neurological and intellectual functioning in PKU. In a double-blind multicentric trial, 109 PKU patients were randomized to DHA doses from 0 to 7 mg/kg&day for six months. Before and after supplementation, we determined plasma fatty acid concentrations, latencies of visually evoked potentials, fine and gross motor behavior, and IQ. Fatty acid desaturase genotypes were also determined. DHA supplementation increased plasma glycerophospholipid DHA proportional to dose by 0.4% DHA per 1 mg intake/kg bodyweight. Functional outcomes were not associated with DHA status before and after intervention and remained unchanged by supplementation. Genotypes were associated with plasma arachidonic acid levels and, if considered together with the levels of the precursor alpha-linolenic acid, also with DHA. Functional outcomes and supplementation effects were not significantly associated with genotype. DHA intakes up to 7 mg/kg did not improve neurological functions in PKU children. Nervous tissues may be less prone to low DHA levels after infancy, or higher doses might be required to impact neurological functions.

The study cohort consisted of all female Florida Medicaid enrollees who delivered a live singleton infant during study period. Drug exposure was defined as any exposure to Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy. Mothers with no AED exposure served as the AED unexposed group for comparison. Four adverse outcomes, birth defect (BD), abnormal condition of new born (ACNB), low birth weight (LBW), and pregnancy and obstetrical complication (PCOC), were examined and combined using a latent trait model to generate an overall severity index. Unidimentionality, local independence, internal homogeneity, and construct validity were evaluated for the combined outcome.ResultsThe study cohort consisted of 3183 mother-infant pairs in total AED group, 226 in the valproate only subgroup, and 43,956 in the AED unexposed group. Compared to AED unexposed group, the rate of BD was higher in both the total AED group (12.8% vs. 10.5%, P < .0001), and the valproate only subgroup (19.6% vs. 10.5%, P < .0001). The combined outcome was significantly correlated with the length of hospital stay during delivery in both the total AED group (Rho = 0.24, P < .0001) and the valproate only subgroup (Rho = 0.16, P = .01).

The present study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of two chromatographic methodologies for determination of plasma Phe level in the routine management of PKU: the two dimensional thin layer chromatography (2D - TLC) and the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedures, respectively.Material and MethodsSamples of blood from 23 children with HPA detected by neonatal screening or with confirmed PKU who received treatment by low-Phe diet were analyzed to estimate the plasma Phe level by the two chromatographic procedures.ResultsIn case of three subjects the very low concentrations of plasma Phe could not be detected by the 2D - TLC methodology, since the spot was not visible on the chromatogram. In four patients the differences between the values of plasma Phe determined by the two methodologies are not statistically significant, while in fifteen subjects the differences are highly statistically significant. This is due to the greater errors that appear in the case of 2D - TLC methodology. In the range of concentrations of plasma Phe higher than 360 μmol/L (which is the cut-off value for HPA), although in four cases there were statistically significant differences in the level of plasma Phe determined by the two methodologies, the value obtained by the 2D - TLC methodology was high enough to influence the decision of changing the diet so that HPA is kept under control. In addition, the intense spot of Phe on the 2D - TLC chromatogram may be detected even by un unexperienced laboratory specialist.ConclusionThe HPLC procedure for measurement of plasma Phe level is very suitable to be used in the routine management of PKU.

Clinical symptoms can vary from a severe life-threatening condition to an asymptomatic state, reported in the majority of cases. Since the expansion of newborn screenings, more than three hundred probands were admitted for molecular-genetic analysis, most selected because of elevated values of C4-acylcarnitine detected in newborn screenings in Slovakia. Searching for the principal genomic changes led us to the selection of sixty-two patients in whom the presence of sequence variants in the ACADS gene was analysed and correlated with the available biochemical and clinical data.MethodsBiochemical and molecular genetic tests were performed. Acylcarnitine profiles focused on an elevated level of C4-acylcarnitine, which was analysed via tandem mass spectrometry. Urinary organic acids, specifically a quantity of ethylmalonic acid, were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The entire coding region of the ACADS gene was sequenced. A low-cost restriction fragment length polymorphism of PCR amplified fragments analysis (PCR-RFLP) of pathogenic variants was introduced and implemented for the molecular-genetic algorithm appropriate for the Slovak population.ResultsOur molecular genetic study was performed on sixty-two patients with a pathological biochemical pattern related to short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.

Up to 86% of investigated individuals belong to the Roma ethnic group.ConclusionsAnalogous to other countries, SCADD is not included in the newborn screening programme. Based on the exceeded levels of the specific biomarker C4-acylcarnitine as well as ethylmalonic acid, we revealed a high prevalence of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency cases, confirmed by the findings of two rare pathogenic variants.

Therefore, we believe that the study of metabolite assemblies is not only important in order to understand their role in normal physiology and in pathology, but also paves a new route in exploring the fabrication of organic, bio-compatible materials.Keywords: Metabolites, Self-assembly, Photonic crystals, Functional amyloids, Supramolecular structures, Nanostructures",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6354908/,abstract

We collected medical and genomic information for developing a biobank to be used for this healthcare system. We designed a questionnaire-based pedigree-creation software program named “f-treeGC,” which enables even less experienced medical practitioners to accurately and rapidly collect family health history and create pedigree charts.Resultsf-treeGC may be run on Adobe AIR. Pedigree charts are created in the following manner: 1) At system startup, the client is prompted to provide required information on the presence or absence of children; f-treeGC is capable of creating a pedigree up to three generations. 2) An interviewer fills out a multiple-choice questionnaire on genealogical information. 3) The information requested includes name, age, gender, general status, infertility status, pregnancy status, fetal status, and physical features or health conditions of individuals over three generations. In addition, information regarding the client and the proband, and birth order information, including multiple gestation, custody, multiple individuals, donor or surrogate, adoption, and consanguinity may be included. 4) f-treeGC shows only marriages between first cousins via the overlay function. 5) f-treeGC automatically creates a pedigree chart, and the chart-creation process is visible for inspection on the screen in real time. 6) The genealogical data may be saved as a file in the original format. The created/modified date and time may be changed as required, and the file may be password-protected and/or saved in read-only format. To enable sorting or searching from the database, the file name automatically contains the terms typed into the entry fields, including physical features or health conditions, by default. 7) Alternatively, family histories are collected using a completed foldable interview paper sheet named “f-sheet”, which is identical to the questionnaire in f-treeGC.ConclusionsWe developed a questionnaire-based family tree-creation software, named f-treeGC, which is fully compliant with international recommendations for standardized human pedigree nomenclature. The present software simplifies the process of collecting family histories and pedigrees, and has a variety of uses, from genome cohort studies or primary care to genetic counseling.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12881-017-0433-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Keywords: Pedigree, Family tree, Software, Questionnaire, Family health history, Interview sheet, Genetic counseling, Genome cohort studies, Primary care, Biobank",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5512935/,abstract

Sucralose (Splenda) currently holds the majority of the NNS market share and is often combined with acesulfame-potassium in a wide variety of foods and beverages. To date, saccharin is the only NNS reported to be found in human breast milk after maternal consumption, while there is no apparent information on the other NNS. Breast milk samples were collected from 20 lactating volunteers, irrespective of their habitual NNS intake. Saccharin, sucralose, and acesulfame-potassium were present in 65% of participants’ milk samples, whereas aspartame was not detected. These data indicate that NNS are frequently ingested by nursing infants, and thus prospective clinical studies are necessary to determine whether early NNS exposure via breast milk may have clinical implications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5583633/,abstract

The analysis of the concentration of food allergen residues in processing equipment, in raw materials or in the final product, provides analytical information that can be used for risk assessment as well as to ensure that food-allergic consumers get accurate and useful information to make their food choices and purchasing decisions. The development of biosensors based on nanomaterials for applications in food analysis is a challenging area of growing interest in the last years. Research in this field requires the combined efforts of experts in very different areas including food chemistry, biotechnology or materials science. However, the outcome of such collaboration can be of significant impact on the food industry as well as for consumer’s safety. These nanobiosensing devices allow the rapid, selective, sensitive, cost-effective and, in some cases, in-field, online and real-time detection of a wide range of compounds, even in complex matrices. Moreover, they can also enable the design of novel allergen detection strategies. Herein we review the main advances in the use of nanoparticles for the development of biosensors and bioassays for allergen detection, in food samples, over the past few years. Research in this area is still in its infancy in comparison, for instance, to the application of nanobiosensors for clinical analysis.

Although appreciated for its role in biomarker discovery programs, metabolomics can also be used to identify metabolites that could alter a cell’s or an organism’s phenotype. Metabolomics activity screening (MAS) as described here integrates metabolomics data with metabolic pathways and systems biology information, including proteomics and transcriptomics data, to produce a set of endogenous metabolites that can be tested for functionality in altering phenotypes. A growing literature reports the use of metabolites to modulate diverse processes, such as stem cell differentiation, oligodendrocyte maturation, insulin signaling, T-cell survival and macrophage immune responses. This opens up the possibility of identifying and applying metabolites to affect phenotypes. Unlike genes or proteins, metabolites are often readily available, which means that MAS is broadly amenable to high-throughput screening of virtually any biological system.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5937131/,abstract

This study examined the validity of using the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition (ABAS-II), and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) for assessing developmental status in metabolic disorders and for identifying individuals at risk for cognitive deficits. Results from individuals with urea cycle disorders, phenylketonuria, galactosemia, and fatty acid oxidation disorders were obtained on the ABAS-II and BRIEF and were compared to results obtained from neuropsychological testing performed on the same day. Correlations between scores on the ABAS-II and developmental or IQ tests for individuals with urea cycle disorders ranged from 0.48 to 0.72 and concordance rates for scores greater than a standard deviation below the normative mean ranged from 69 to 89%. Correlations ranged from 0.20 to 0.68 with concordance ranging from 73 to 90% in the other metabolic disorders. For the BRIEF, correlations with other tests of executive functioning were significant for urea cycle disorders, with concordance ranging from 52 to 80%. For the other metabolic disorders, correlations ranged from −0.09 to −0.55. Concordance rates for at-risk status on the BRIEF and executive functioning tests ranged from 55% in adults to 80% in children with other metabolic disorders.

Parents completed the SAI when the child was 3, 6, and 15 months old and annually thereafter. Children were tested for IA every 3 months for 4 years and every 6 months thereafter. Parent SAI scores of 6,799 children followed with IA testing for at least 1 and up to 6 years were examined.RESULTSAt study inception, parents showed high levels of anxiety in response to their child’s increased genetic type 1 diabetes risk; mothers were more anxious than fathers, and parents with diabetes in the family were more anxious than parents with no family history. In response to repeated IA-negative (IA−) test results, parent anxiety declined to normal levels. Anxiety increased in parents faced with an IA-positive (IA+) test result. Parents faced with two or more types of IA+ test results showed particularly high levels of anxiety (all P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONSInfant genetic screening for type 1 diabetes raises parent anxiety when the child is at increased risk, but anxiety dissipates over time in cases of repeated IA− results.

Dietary therapy is the mainstay of treatment for many of these disorders and thus, trained metabolic dietitians are critical members of the multidisciplinary team required for management of such patients. The main goals of dietary therapy in inborn errors of metabolism are the maintenance of normal growth and development while limiting offending metabolites and providing deficient products. Typically, the offending metabolite is either significantly reduced or removed completely from the diet and then reintroduced in small quantities until blood levels are within the normal range. Such treatment is required in infancy, childhood and adulthood and requires careful monitoring of micronutrient and macronutrient intake throughout the lifespan. The goal of this review is to highlight the basic principles of chronic nutritional management of the inborn errors of protein, carbohydrate and fat metabolism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4515158/,abstract

Policy Points:
Newborn screening not only saves lives but can also yield net
societal economic benefit, in addition to benefits such as improved
quality of life to affected individuals and families.Calculations of net economic benefit from newborn screening include
the monetary equivalent of avoided deaths and reductions in costs
of care for complications associated with late‐diagnosed
individuals minus the additional costs of screening, diagnosis, and
treatment associated with prompt diagnosis.Since 2001 the Washington State Department of Health has
successfully implemented an approach to conducting evidence‐based
economic evaluations of disorders proposed for addition to the
state‐mandated newborn screening panel.

ContextEconomic evaluations can inform policy decisions on the expansion of
newborn screening panels. This article documents the use of cost‐benefit models in
Washington State as part of the rule‐making process that resulted in the
implementation of screening for medium‐chain acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD)
deficiency and 4 other metabolic disorders in 2004, cystic fibrosis (CF) in 2006,
15 other metabolic disorders in 2008, and severe combined immune deficiency (SCID)
in 2014.MethodsWe reviewed Washington State Department of Health internal reports
and spreadsheet models of expected net societal benefit of adding disorders to the
state newborn screening panel. We summarize the assumptions and findings for 2
models (MCAD and CF) and discuss them in relation to findings in the peer‐reviewed
literature.FindingsThe MCAD model projected a benefit‐cost ratio of 3.4 to 1 based on
assumptions of a 20.0 percentage point reduction in infant mortality and a 13.9
percentage point reduction in serious developmental disability. The CF model
projected a benefit‐cost ratio of 4.0‐5.4 to 1 for a discount rate of 3%‐4% and a
plausible range of 1‐2 percentage point reductions in deaths up to age 10
years.ConclusionsThe Washington State cost‐benefit models of newborn screening were
broadly consistent with peer‐reviewed literature, and their findings of net
benefit appear to be robust to uncertainty in parameters. Public health newborn
screening programs can develop their own capacity to project expected costs and
benefits of expansion of newborn screening panels, although it would be most
efficient if this capacity were shared among programs.Keywords: neonatal screening, economics, cost‐benefit analysis, cystic fibrosis, MCAD deficiency",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911729/,abstract

The bacterial enzymes are hexameric, arranged with 32 symmetry, and each polypeptide consists of an N-terminal substrate-binding segment (domain I) followed by a C-terminal cofactor-binding segment (domain II). The catalytic reaction takes place in the cleft formed at the junction of the two domains. Distinct signature sequences in the nucleotide-binding domain have been linked to the binding of NAD+
versus NADP+, but they are not unambiguous predictors of cofactor preference. In the absence of substrate, the two domains move apart as rigid bodies, as shown by the apo structure of glutamate dehydrogenase from Clostridium symbiosum. Here, the crystal structure of a chimaeric clostridial/Escherichia coli enzyme has been determined in the apo state. The enzyme is fully functional and reveals possible determinants of interdomain flexibility at a hinge region following the pivot helix.
