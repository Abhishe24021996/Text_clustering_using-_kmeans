aim: to study diurnal and day-to-day variation of phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations in tyrosinemia type 1 patients.
methods: eighteen tyrosinemia type 1 patients aged >1 year (median age 7.9 years; range 1.6–20.7) were studied. capillary blood samples were collected 4 times a day (t1: pre-breakfast, t2: pre-midday meal, t3: before evening meal, and t4: bedtime) for 3 days. linear mixed-effect models were used to investigate diurnal and day-to-day variation of both phenylalanine and tyrosine.
results: the coefficients of variation of phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations were the lowest on t1 (13.8% and 14.1%, respectively). tyrosine concentrations did not significantly differ between the different time points, but phenylalanine concentrations were significantly lower at t2 and t3 compared to t1 (50.1 μmol/l, 29.8 μmol/l, and 37.3 μmol/l, respectively).
conclusion: our results indicated that for prevention of too low phenylalanine and too high tyrosine concentrations, measurement of phenylalanine and tyrosine pre-midday meal would be best, since phenylalanine concentrations are the lowest on that time point. our results also indicated that whilst blood tyrosine concentrations were stable over 24 h, phenylalanine fluctuated. day-to-day variation was most stable after an overnight fast for both phenylalanine and tyrosine. therefore, in tyrosinemia type 1 patients the most reliable time point for measuring phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations to enable interpretation of metabolic control is pre-breakfast.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5680281/,abstract,t3,pre-breakfast,,,

methods: disease-specific patient- and parent-reported hrqol questions were constructed in german based on focus group interviews with patients and parents. questionnaires for patients from 8 to 18 years were piloted with 14 participants (n = 9 children and adolescents, n = 5 parents) by cognitive debriefing and tested psychometrically with 80 participants (n = 38 patients, n = 42 parents) for item characteristics, validity, and reliability to construct the first version of a disease-specific hrqol questionnaire.
results: twenty-eight questions were selected based on item descriptives. scales of self- and proxy questionnaires demonstrated acceptable to excellent reliability in terms of internal consistency (cronbach’s α = 0.70–0.93). scales and total scores correlated with those of generic hrqol questionnaires, showing convergent validity.

patients and methods
 this was a multicenter, randomized, observer-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 clinical trial, where patients were randomized between pmf 104 and peg-asc. in both groups, patients were instructed to take a full-dose regimen the evening before if colonoscopy was scheduled before 11 am to 12 pm, or to take a split regimen if colonoscopy was scheduled after 11 am to 12 pm. the primary end-point was an equivalence between pmf104 and peg-asc in the rate of adequate level of cleansing (ottawa scale ≤ 6), with safety, mucosal visibility, tolerability, acceptance and compliance being also assessed.

results: there was no significant difference between tbwdeut and tbwbia (p = 0.344) or ffmdeut and ffmbia (p = 0.111). tbwdeut and tbwbia were highly correlated (r = 0.990, p < 0.0001), as were ffmdeut and ffmbia (r = 0.984, p < 0.0001). bland-altman plots demonstrated that there was no proportional bias between the criterion method, tbwdeut, and the test method tbwbia, in estimating tbw (β = −0.056, adjusted r

methods: nine adults with early treated classic pku received magnetic resonance imaging (mri) with cosy and a battery of neuropsychological tests. brain phe and tyr in parietal white matter (pwm) were compared to results in gray matter of the posterior cingulate gyrus (pcg).
results: brain phe ranged from 101 to 182 (mean = 136.76 ± 23.77) μmol/l in pcg and 76 to 185 (mean = 130.11 ± 37.88) μmol/l in pwm. brain tyr ranged from 4.0 to 7.4 (mean = 5.44 ± 1.01) μmol/l in pcg and 4.1 to 8.4 (mean = 5.90 ± 1.48) μmol/l in pwm. correlation coefficients were largest for brain phe pwm and measures of auditory memory (rho = −0.79), anxiety (rho = 0.79), and executive functioning (rho = 0.69). associations were in the expected direction, with higher brain phe and lower brain tyr related to poorer functioning. the two participants with severe structural mri abnormalities had low brain tyr levels in pcg and 3/5 of the participants with moderate to severe mri abnormalities had higher than average brain phe levels.

methods: focus group interviews with 19 paediatric it-iem patients and 26 parents were conducted in four metabolic centres in austria, germany and switzerland. disease-specific hrqol categories were established by qualitative content analysis.
results: fourteen disease-specific topics related to the three well-established generic hrqol dimensions of physical, mental and social functioning were derived from the interview transcripts. both patients and parents perceived dietary restrictions and social stigmatisation as major burdens. dietary restrictions and emotional burdens were more important for young (<8 years) patients, whereas cognition, fatigue and social issues were more relevant to older patients (≥8 years). treatment-related topics had a significant effect on social and emotional hrqol.
discussion: by exploring patients’ and parents’ perspectives, 14 hrqol categories were identified. these new categories will allow the development of a disease-specific, standardised questionnaire to assess hrqol in paediatric it-iem patients. age-appropriate information on the disease and psychosocial support targeted to patients’ individual burdens are essential to the delivery of personalised care that takes account of physical, mental and social dimensions of hrqol.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5388637/,abstract,,"’ , ’",,,

catalytic domains of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases (aaahs)
contain a non-heme iron coordinated to a 2-his-1-carboxylate facial
triad and two water molecules. asp139 from chromobacterium
violaceum pah (cpah) resides within the second coordination
sphere and contributes key hydrogen bonds with three active site waters
that mediate its interaction with an oxidized form of the cofactor,
7,8-dihydro-l-biopterin, in crystal structures. to determine
the catalytic role of this residue, various point mutants were prepared
and characterized. our isothermal titration calorimetry (itc) analysis
of iron binding implies that polarity at position 139 is not the sole
criterion for metal affinity, as binding studies with d139e suggest
that the size of the amino acid side chain also appears to be important.
high-resolution crystal structures of the mutants reveal that asp139
may not be essential for holding the bridging water molecules together,
because many of these waters are retained even in the ala mutant.
however, interactions via the bridging waters contribute to cofactor
binding at the active site, interactions for which charge of the residue
is important, as the d139n mutant shows a 5-fold decrease in its affinity
for pterin as revealed by itc (compared to a 16-fold loss of affinity
in the case of the ala mutant). the asn and ala mutants show a much
more pronounced defect in their kcat values,
with nearly 16- and 100-fold changes relative to that of the wild
type, respectively, indicating a substantial role of this residue
in stabilization of the transition state by aligning the cofactor
in a productive orientation, most likely through direct binding with
the cofactor, supported by data from molecular dynamics simulations
of the complexes. our results indicate that the intervening water
structure between the cofactor and the acidic residue masks direct
interaction between the two, possibly to prevent uncoupled hydroxylation
of the cofactor before the arrival of phenylalanine. it thus appears
that the second-coordination sphere asp residue in cpah, and, by extrapolation,
the equivalent residue in other aaahs, plays a role in fine-tuning
pterin affinity in the ground state via deformable interactions with
bridging waters and assumes a more significant role in the transition
state by aligning the cofactor through direct hydrogen bonding.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4222540/,abstract,,"asp139 , pah , cofactor , position 139 , d139e , amino acid side chain , asp139

methods: the mip for l-phenylalanine, as a water-soluble template, was successfully synthesized without derivatization. synthesization was done by a uv polymerization method in which methacrylic acid (maa), as a functional monomer, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (egdma), as a cross-linker, were used in the presence of five different porogenic solvents including; acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran (thf), chloroform, toluene and dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso). the selectivity of the mip was examined using 19 different amino acids in human serum and was evaluated by hplc. in addition, morphological studies were conducted using sem.

results: the results showed that the obtained mip with acetonitrile had the highest capacity and selectivity compared with other solvents. the data indicated that phe-binding to mip was significantly more than the former binding to nip in eisf (p≤0.05). moreover, in comparison with nip and control group, mip showed a better selectivity and binding for phe. this could be used for the reduction of phe in human serum samples of phenylketonuria.

“attrition”) is widely recognized as a public health crisis, and has
been discussed openly for the last two decades. multiple recent reviews argue that
animals may be just too different physiologically, anatomically, and psychologically
from humans to be able to predict human outcomes, essentially questioning the
justification of basic biomedical research in animals.this review argues instead that the philosophy and practice of experimental design
and analysis is so different in basic animal work and human clinical trials that an
animal experiment (as currently conducted) cannot reasonably predict the outcome of a
human trial. thus, attrition does reflect a lack of predictive validity of animal
experiments, but it would be a tragic mistake to conclude that animal models cannot
show predictive validity.a variety of contributing factors to poor validity are reviewed. the need to adopt
methods and models that are highly specific (i.e., which can identify true negative
results) in order to complement the current preponderance of highly sensitive methods
(which are prone to false positive results) is emphasized. concepts in
biomarker-based medicine are offered as a potential solution, and changes in the use
of animal models required to embrace a translational biomarker-based approach are
outlined. in essence, this review advocates a fundamental shift, where we treat every
aspect of an animal experiment that we can as if it was a clinical trial in a human
population.however, it is unrealistic to expect researchers to adopt a new methodology that
cannot be empirically justified until a successful human trial. “validation
with known failures” is proposed as a solution. thus new methods or models can
be compared against existing ones using a drug that has translated (a known positive)
and one that has failed (a known negative). current methods should incorrectly
identify both as effective, but a more specific method should identify the negative
compound correctly. by using a library of known failures we can thereby empirically
test the impact of suggested solutions such as enrichment, controlled
heterogenization, biomarker-based models, or reverse-translated measures",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342719/,abstract,,"human

methods: a qualitative research was conducted, using the framework analysis approach. participants consisted of senior managers and technicians in mohme. purposeful sampling was done, with a maximum variety, for the selection of research participants: individuals having at least 5 years of experience in preparing evidence-based policy documents. face-to-face interviews were conducted for data collection. as a guideline for the interviews, ‘the utilization of evidence in policy-making organizations’ procedure was used. the data were analyzed through the analysis of the framework method using maxqda 10 software.

results: the participants acquired the research evidence in a topic-based form, and they were less likely to search on the basis of the evidence pyramid. to assess the quality of evidence, they did not use standard critical tools; to adapt the evidence and interventions with the local setting, they did not use the ideas and experiences of all stakeholders, and in preparing the evidence-based policy documents, they did not take into consideration the window of opportunity, did not refrain from using highly technical terms, did not write user-friendly summaries, and did not present alternative policy options. in order to develop health policies, however, they used the following innovations: attention to the financial burden of policy issues on the agenda, sensitivity analysis of the preferred policy option on the basis of technical, sociopolitical, and economic feasibility, advocacy from other scholars, using the multi-criteria decision-making models for the prioritization of policy options, implementation of policy based on the degree of readiness of policy-implementing units, and the classification of policy documents on the basis of different conditions of policy-making (urgent, short-term, and long-term).
